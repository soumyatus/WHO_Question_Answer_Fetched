{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What is Ebola disease?", "answer": "Ebola disease is a rare but severe illness, caused by a virus belonging to the genus orthoebolavirus of the Filoviridae family. Death rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. Six species of orthoebolaviruses have been identified to date, with three known to cause large outbreaks: Ebola virus (EBOV) causing Ebola virus disease (EVD) Sudan virus (SUDV) causing Sudan virus disease (SVD) Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) causing Bundibugyo virus disease (BVD). The animal reservoir of the viruses is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats ( Pteropodidae ) may be a host."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What are the typical symptoms of Ebola disease?", "answer": "The symptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and can include: fever fatigue muscle pain headache and sore throat. These can be followed by: vomiting diarrhoea rash internal and external bleeding."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "How long does it take for people to develop symptoms after being infected?", "answer": "The time interval from infection to onset of symptoms ranges from 2 to 21 days. People are only infectious once they develop symptoms. Even when people have developed Ebola disease-like symptoms, only a laboratory test can confirm whether the cause is Ebola."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What is the difference between Ebola disease and other diseases with similar symptoms?", "answer": "Ebola disease symptoms often appear suddenly and require early care by trained clinicians. Because of the similarity of symptoms, it can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola disease from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, dengue or Marburg virus disease. Therefore, it is essential that people with Ebola disease-like symptoms seek advice immediately from a health-care provider. Testing is the first step in identifying accurately what is causing illness and is essential for providing the right treatment. Early testing and treatment save lives and protect community and family members, including local health and care workers."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "How does Ebola disease spread?", "answer": "Ebola disease most commonly spreads from person to person via exposure to blood or other body fluids (mostly through faeces, vomit, sweat and saliva) of an infected person, alive or deceased. This occurs when the virus enters a body through broken skin or mucous membranes (such as the eyes, nose or mouth), most often while someone is caring for a patient or touching the body of someone who has died from the disease. It is also spread by touching or handling objects that have been contaminated with the body fluids of a sick person or someone who has died from Ebola disease. In rare instances, transmission from a male survivor to his sexual partner has been documented. This is because the virus can persist for some time in the semen of some male survivors after they recover from the disease."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What should people do to protect themselves during an Ebola disease outbreak?", "answer": "In case of an Ebola disease outbreak, people can protect themselves by taking specific measures that reduce the risk of infection. These include: avoiding physical contact with individuals who are suspected of or confirmed to have Ebola disease; refraining from handling the bodies of people who had symptoms of Ebola disease and have died, without appropriate protective measures; and washing hands regularly, applying best practices recommended by local authorities on hand washing."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What should people do to protect themselves from getting infected from animals?", "answer": "People can protect themselves from getting infected from animals by: avoiding eating dead animals or touching them without protective measures, especially during an Ebola disease outbreak; washing their hands correctly before and after touching any animal or related animal products; and cooking thoroughly animal products (blood and meat) before consumption."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "Who is most at risk?", "answer": "During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are: health and care workers in close contact with patients; caretakers, family members or others in direct physical contact with infected people; and mourners who have direct physical contact with bodies during funerals or burial rituals."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "Why are health-care workers at greater risk of catching Ebola?", "answer": "Community health and care workers are among the first to detect new illnesses within a community, raise alerts, and refer those who are ill to the health facility. Health-care workers and community health workers are at greater risk of infection when they: are not wearing correct personal protective equipment (PPE); and are not applying infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for patients or managing bodies of the deceased. Since the symptoms of Ebola disease are similar to many other common illnesses, community health and care workers may not immediately use appropriate infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What can people do after direct physical contact with someone with Ebola disease?", "answer": "If you have been in direct physical contact with a person infected or suspected with Ebola, you may be at risk of developing the disease. It is important that you contact your health-care provider or local health facility so that they can advise you on the next steps. Once you have been identified as a “contact”, your health will be monitored for 21 days following the exposure. The local authorities or health and care workers will guide you on recommended behaviors and encourage you: to accept a daily visit from the contact tracing team to monitor your health, with respect to your occupation; to allow your temperature to be taken; to answer all questions as accurately as you can and ask any question you may have, including any arrangement that would make this follow-up more agreeable to you; to report your symptoms (if any) as soon as you develop them; to avoid travelling unless travel has been discussed with your local health authority; and to take a vaccine if it is available. You will be encouraged to help identify your contacts so that they can also be offered the vaccine. If symptoms develop while being monitored for 21 days, you will be advised to go to an appropriate care centre. If you are requested to perform a laboratory test, the results will guide the health professional on whether you should immediately be admitted to a treatment centre for care or not. Early care improves survival and will help to break the chain of transmission within the community and families."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "Is there any treatment for Ebola?", "answer": "There are two approved treatments for adults and children with Ebola virus disease (EVD), which are themonoclonal antibodies mAb114 (ansuvimabTM) and REGN-EB3 (InmazebTM). Building on these successes, potential new treatments are being evaluated for other orthoebolaviruses, but these have not yet been fully tested. If you or a loved one tests positive for Ebola disease, early supportive care at a designated treatment centre is essential and can improve the chance of survival. Care is free of charge and includes rehydration, provision of proper nutrition and the management of symptoms."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "Can people with Ebola be cared for at home?", "answer": "WHO does not advise families or communities to care for people with Ebola disease at home. People with symptoms should seek care at a health facility. Early supportive care at a designated treatment centre is essential and can improve the chance of recovery. If a person dies at home with suspicions of Ebola disease, the community and family members should refrain from handling or preparing the body for burial. Community or family members should immediately get in contact with local health authorities to perform a safe and dignified burial of the deceased person in accordance with the family’s wishes."}
{"topic": "/ebola-disease", "question": "What should people do if they want to travel during an Ebola disease outbreak?", "answer": "WHO does not recommend trade or movement restrictions such as lockdowns or quarantines in areas affected by Ebola disease. However, travel of close contacts of Ebola disease cases should be minimized or postponed wherever possible to protect people who may be exposed to the virus during travel and to avoid spreading of the virus. If travel of a contact is necessary, it should be discussed and supervised by the public health authorities for them to ensure the appropriate follow-up in the host area."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "What is the malaria situation and who is most at risk?", "answer": "Despite progress, malaria remains a serious global health challenge. There were an estimated 282 million malaria cases and 610 000 malaria deaths globally in 2024. The WHO African Region continues to shoulder the heaviest malaria burden, comprising 94% of malaria cases and 95% of malaria deaths globally. Children are particularly vulnerable; WHO estimates that about 438 000 African children died from malaria in 2024. There are positive trends in the scale-up of effective prevention tools, including the rollout of life-saving malaria vaccines for children in over 20 African countries."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "What is the WHO recommendation for the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines?", "answer": "WHO recommends the use of malaria vaccines for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria in children living in malaria endemic areas, prioritizing areas of moderate and high transmission. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses to children      from around 5 months of age. A 5th dose, given one year after dose 4, may      be considered in areas of highly seasonal transmission or where malaria      risk remains high during the third year of life or beyond. In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission or areas with perennial      malaria transmission with seasonal peaks, countries may consider providing      the vaccine using an age-based administration, seasonal administration, or      a hybrid of these approaches. Countries should prioritize vaccination in areas of moderate and high transmission      but may also consider providing the vaccine in low transmission settings.      Decisions on expanding to low transmission settings should be considered      at a country level, based on the overall malaria control strategy,      cost-effectiveness, affordability, and programmatic considerations. Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control      strategy."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "What do we know about the WHO-recommended malaria vaccines?", "answer": "The RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines act against P. falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa. Both malaria vaccines are safe and efficacious, and both are prequalified by WHO. In phase 3 clinical trials both vaccines reduced malaria cases by more than 50% during the first year after vaccination – the period when children are at high risk of illness and death. A fourth vaccine dose given in the second year of life prolonged protection. Both vaccines reduce malaria cases by about 75% when given seasonally in areas of highly seasonal transmission where seasonal malaria chemoprevention is provided. An independent evaluation of the pilot introductions of the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, to more than 2 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme, MVIP, between 2019-2023, demonstrated high public health impact: a vaccine-attributable 13% drop in mortality among children age-eligible for vaccination; substantial reduction in hospitalizations for severe malaria; and, improved access to at least one malaria prevention intervention (malaria vaccine or insecticide treated net), reaching more than 90% of children. Highest impact for malaria control is achieved when a combination of WHO-recommended preventive, diagnostic, and treatment strategies are used, tailored by the country to the local context. By the close of 2025, more than 10 million children are targeted annually for malaria vaccination through immunization programmes across 24 countries in Africa, with support from WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and other international and country-level partners. Malaria vaccines increase access to malaria prevention and can save the lives of tens of thousands of children every year."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "How do the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines compare?", "answer": "Both the R21 and RTS,S vaccines are shown to be safe and effective in preventing malaria in children and are expected to have high public health impact. RTS,S has been shown in large pilot implementations to substantially reduce malaria illness and deaths in young children. Given the similarity of the two malaria vaccines, it is likely that R21 will also be highly impactful. The R21 and RTS,S malaria vaccines have not been tested in a head to head trial. There is no evidence to date showing one vaccine performs better than the other. Both vaccines have been shown to reduce malaria cases by more than 50% during the first year after vaccination – this is the period when children are at highest risk of malaria illness and death. A fourth dose prolongs the protection. Both vaccines prevent around 75% of malaria episodes when given seasonally in areas of highly seasonal transmission where seasonal malaria chemoprevention is provided. Multiple modelling studies show cost-effectiveness of malaria vaccines according to standard measures. R21, which is currently less expensive than RTS,S, is estimated to have similar cost effectiveness to other malaria control interventions, and both malaria vaccines are estimated to be highly cost-effective when compared with other childhood vaccines. Costing studies show malaria vaccine introduction costs are similar to the costs of other new vaccines at introduction. Both malaria vaccines are prequalified by WHO, which ensures vaccine safety and quality. The choice of product to be used in a country should be based on programmatic characteristics, vaccine supply and vaccine affordability. Gavi-eligible countries can receive support for malaria vaccines while co-financing a portion of the cost. Many Gavi-supported countries will pay as little as US$ 0.20 per dose for either vaccine."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "What is the status of malaria vaccines roll-out?", "answer": "Rollout of malaria vaccines has moved forward at a record pace for new vaccines over the last 2 years. Today, 24 countries in Africa are offering malaria vaccines as part of childhood immunization programmes and according to national malaria control plans. This includes 5 countries that have introduced nationally, and 19 countries that are offering vaccines at subnational levels with plans to reach more areas over time. Collectively, more than 10 million children per year are targeted for malaria vaccination across these countries. Demand for the malaria vaccines has been unprecedented. At least 30 countries in Africa planned to introduce the malaria vaccine into their childhood immunization programmes and as part of their national malaria control strategies. Countries now offering malaria vaccines include Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, Uganda and Zambia . With two malaria vaccines recommended and available, vaccine supply is sufficient to meet the high demand. However, most countries are currently implementing the malaria vaccine below their national target scale due to limited funding. WHO continues to work with Gavi, UNICEF and other international and country-level partners in support of wider malaria vaccine introduction."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "What does access to malaria vaccines mean for children at risk, and for malaria progress?", "answer": "Children under five years of age bear the greatest burden of malaria, with WHO estimating that approximately 438,000 African children died from the disease in 2024. Tens of thousands of young lives could be saved every year with the wide implementation of these malaria vaccines. According to modelling estimates, malaria vaccines could prevent approximately half a million child deaths by 2035 if they were scaled up in moderate and high malaria transmission areas. Malaria vaccines can revitalize the fight against malaria and increase child survival. Highest impact to drive down child illness and deaths will be achieved when a mix of WHO-recommended malaria interventions is implemented, tailored to the local context. Although current vaccine supply can meet the high demand, funding constraints are preventing many countries from scaling up malaria vaccination to their national targets."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine", "question": "What was the MVIP and how did it help to bring malaria vaccines forward?", "answer": "The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme, MVIP, was designed to evaluate the public health use of the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, to inform WHO recommendations for a malaria vaccine for children. From 2019 through 2023, more than 2 million children were reached with the malaria vaccine through childhood immunization programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Vaccine implementation resulted in high public health impact: early childhood deaths were reduced by 13% among children age-eligible for vaccination; and hospitalizations for severe malaria dropped substantially. Based on data generated through the MVIP after 24 months of vaccination in the pilot countries, WHO recommended the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, to prevent malaria in children in October 2021. All 3 countries have continued to provide malaria vaccination through childhood immunization programmes, and expanded vaccination areas, with Gavi support, after completion of the pilots. The success of the MVIP and lessons learned through the pilot programme informed considerations for the R21 vaccine and facilitated more efficient development of additional malaria vaccines. These efforts contributed to WHO’s recommendation for the second malaria vaccine, R21, in October 2023. The MVIP was coordinated by WHO and supported by in-country and international partners, including Ministries of Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, PATH, UNICEF and GSK. Financing for the MVIP was provided by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid."}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "What is malaria and how is it transmitted?", "answer": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease primarily found in tropical countries. It is both preventable and curable. However, without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, a case of uncomplicated malaria can progress to a severe form of the disease, which is often fatal without treatment. Malaria is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another; the disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes.  Five species of parasites can cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat. There are over 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes and around 40, known as vector species, can transmit the disease. This risk of infection is higher in some areas than others depending on multiple factors, including the type of local mosquitoes. It may also vary according to the season, the risk being highest during the rainy season in tropical countries."}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "Who is at risk of malaria?", "answer": "Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria. In 2023, an estimated 263 million people contracted malaria in 83 countries. That same year, the disease claimed approximately 597 000 lives. Some people are more susceptible to developing severe malaria than others. Infants and children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk. Other vulnerable groups include people entering areas with intense malaria transmission who have not acquired partial immunity from long exposure to the disease, or who are not taking chemopreventive therapies, such as migrants, mobile populations and travellers. Some people in areas where malaria is common will develop partial immunity. While it never provides complete protection, partial immunity reduces the risk that malaria infection will cause severe disease. For this reason, most malaria deaths in Africa occur in young children, whereas in areas with less transmission and low immunity, all age groups are at risk."}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "What are the symptoms and how is it diagnosed?", "answer": "The first symptoms of malaria usually begin within 10–15 days after the bite from an infected mosquito. Fever, headache and chills are typically experienced, though these symptoms may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. In malaria endemic areas, people who have developed partial immunity may become infected but experience no symptoms (asymptomatic infections). WHO recommends prompt diagnosis for anyone with suspected malaria. If Plasmodium falciparum malaria is not treated within 24 hours, the infection can progress to severe illness and death. Severe malaria can cause multi-organ failure in adults, while children frequently suffer from severe anaemia, respiratory distress or cerebral malaria. Human malaria caused by other Plasmodium species can cause significant illness and occasionally life-threatening disease. Malaria can be diagnosed using tests that determine the presence of the parasites causing the disease. There are 2 main types of tests: microscopic examination of blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests. Diagnostic testing enables health providers to distinguish malarial from other causes of febrile illnesses, facilitating appropriate treatment. More information on malaria diagnostic testing"}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "What treatments are available for malaria?", "answer": "Malaria is a treatable disease. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the most effective antimalarial medicines available today and the mainstay of recommended treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest malaria parasite globally. ACTs combine 2 active pharmaceuticals with different mechanisms of action, including derivates of artemisinin extracted from the plant Artemisia annua and a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites\r\n    during the first 3 days of treatment, while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites. As no alternative to artemisinin derivatives is expected to enter the market for several years, the efficacy of ACTs must be preserved, which is why WHO recommends that treatment should only be administered if a person tests positive for malaria. WHO does not support the promotion or use of Artemisia plant material (whether teas, tablets or capsules) for the prevention or treatment of malaria. The emergence and spread of artemisinin partial resistance – defined as delayed clearance after treatment with a drug containing an artemisinin – and resistance to ACT partner drugs are significant threats to efforts aimed at reducing the global burden of malaria. In Africa, artemisinin partial resistance is now confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania and is suspected in Ethiopia, Sudan, Namibia and Zambia. Although studies generally show high efficacy of ACTs, concerns remain regarding both the quality and coverage of efficacy data. As part of the WHO strategy to respond to the threat of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa , WHO calls on malaria endemic countries and global malaria partners to strengthen the surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance, and to ensure that the most effective treatments are selected for national treatment policy. More information about artemisinin resistance"}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "Where is malaria most prevalent?", "answer": "Malaria occurs primarily in tropical and subtropical countries. The vast majority of malaria cases and deaths are found in the WHO African Region, with nearly all cases caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. This parasite is also dominant in other malaria hotspots, including the WHO regions of South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific. In the WHO Region of the Americas, the Plasmodium vivax parasite is predominant. The threat of malaria is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and 4 countries in that region accounted for over half of all malaria deaths worldwide in 2023: Nigeria (30.9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (11.3%), Niger (5.9%) and the United Republic of Tanzania (4.3%)."}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "Is it dangerous to travel to places where malaria is endemic?", "answer": "People who have no partial immunity to malaria are at higher risk of contracting the disease. This includes travellers from non-endemic countries entering areas of high transmission as well as people in malaria-endemic countries living in areas where there is little or no transmission. As symptoms often do not present for 10 to 15 days after infection, travellers may return to their home country before exhibiting signs of the disease. Doctors in non-endemic areas may not recognize the symptoms, causing potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment. In addition, effective antimalarial drugs may not be registered or available in all countries. Chemoprophylaxis can be used as a preventive therapy prior to travelling in endemic areas. When combined with the use of insecticide-treated nets and the repeated application of a topical repellent to prevent mosquito bites, it significantly lowers the risk of infection. If a person has taken chemoprophylaxis as a preventive measure, the same medicine should not be used for treatment if infection occurs. Travellers are encouraged to consult a doctor or their national disease control centre prior to departure to determine the appropriate preventive measures. Chapter on malaria in the WHO “International travel and health”"}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "How can malaria be prevented?", "answer": "Malaria is a preventable disease. 1.\tVector control interventions. Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and reduce transmission. Two forms of vector control are effective for people living in malaria-endemic countries: insecticide-treated nets, which prevent bites while people sleep and which kill mosquitoes as they try to feed, and indoor residual spraying, which is the application of an insecticide to surfaces where mosquitoes tend to rest, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings of houses and other domestic structures. For travellers, the use of an insecticide-treated net is the most practical vector control intervention. WHO maintains a list vector control products that have been assessed for their safety, effectiveness and quality. More information on vector control 2.\tChemopreventive therapies and chemoprophylaxis . Although designed to treat patients already infected with malaria, some antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent the disease. Current WHO-recommended malaria chemopreventive therapies for people living in endemic areas include intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, perennial malaria chemoprevention, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria chemoprevention, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for school-aged children. Chemoprophylaxis drugs are also given to travellers before entering an area where malaria is endemic and can be highly effective when combined with insecticide-treated nets. More information on chemopreventive therapies"}
{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "Is there a vaccine against malaria?", "answer": "In 2021, WHO recommended the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) vaccine to prevent malaria among children living in regions with moderate-to-high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. Vaccines are now being rolled out in routine childhood immunization programmes across Africa. Malaria vaccines in Africa are expected to save tens of thousands of young lives every year. The highest impact will be achieved, however, when the vaccines are introduced alongside a mix of other WHO-recommended malaria interventions such as bed nets and chemoprophylaxis.

{"topic": "/malaria", "question": "Can malaria be eliminated?", "answer": "The vision of WHO and the global malaria community is a world free of malaria. This vision will be achieved progressively by countries eliminating malaria from their territories and implementing effective measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission. Malaria-endemic countries are situated at different points along the road to elimination. The rate of progress depends on the strength of the national health system, the level of investment in malaria elimination strategies and other factors, including biological determinants, the environment and the social, demographic, political and economic realities of a particular country. Over the last 2 decades, significant progress has been achieved towards malaria elimination. According to the latest World malaria report , 25 countries had fewer than 10 cases of the disease in 2023, up from 4 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria (a case contracted locally with no evidence of importation from another endemic country) are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination . Since 2015, 14 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), El Salvador (2021), China (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023), Cabo Verde (2024), Egypt (2024) and Georgia (2025).

{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "What are GLP-1 therapies?", "answer": "GLP-1 therapies (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) are a class of medications that mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. They were originally used for managing type 2 diabetes, but are now also approved for treating obesity and weight loss . Some GLP-1 drugs lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes, kidney and liver disease among other outcomes."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "How do GLP-1 therapies work?", "answer": "GLP-1 medicines stimulate insulin release when blood sugar is high and reduce glucagon secretion, helping lower blood glucose levels. They slow down the process of food digestion and increase feelings of fullness, leading to a reduction in food intake."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "When should people consider taking GLP-1 drugs for weight loss?", "answer": "GLP-1 therapies are not for everyone. They should only be prescribed by a medical practitioner, after taking into account individual health history and clinical indications. Based on current WHO recommendations , GLP-1 medicines may be used as a long-term treatment option for adults with obesity (body mass index ≥30). The guideline does not cover the use of GLP-1 therapies in pregnant women as these medications have not been tested in this population."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "How effective are GLP-1 therapies for weight loss?", "answer": "GPL-1 therapies are efficacious for reducing weight. Most people taking them lose at least 5% of their body weight. However, for better results they should be associated with structured behavioral interventions that incorporate both a healthy diet and physical activity."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "What are the side effects of GLP-1 therapies?", "answer": "Common side effects of GLP-1 drugs are nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. These are usually mild and stop with cessation of therapy or decrease over time. Other gastrointestinal problems – including biliary disease, acute pancreatitis, bowel obstruction and gastroparesis (disorder relating to difficulty in digesting food) – continue to be linked to the use of GLP-1 drugs but are still being evaluated. Thyroid cancer has also been cited as a possible harm. However such risk in humans is still under investigation. Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) – a medical condition characterized by loss of vision – has been considered as a very rare adverse event. However evidence is currently inconclusive."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "How long do people need to take GLP-1 therapies to lose weight?", "answer": "GPL-1 therapies are generally long-term treatments, meaning for 6 months or longer. Data on the long-term efficacy and safety of these therapies, as well as the timing and effects of stopping them, are being monitored by WHO to be able to provide specific guidance in the future."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "Are GLP-1 therapies available everywhere?", "answer": "No, GLP-1 therapies are not available everywhere. Factors influencing their availability are production capacity, registration in countries, cost, and supply issues. Availability is highest in high-income countries, although shortages have occurred due to high demand. Availability is much lower in low- and middle-income countries. WHO supports country efforts to improve the availability of medicines, including GLP-1 therapies."}
{"topic": "/obesity-glp-1-therapies", "question": "Can GLP-1 therapies replace other means of weight control?", "answer": "No, while GLP-1 therapies are used for the treatment of people with obesity, they should not replace other means of weight control.

{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "What is traditional medicine?", "answer": "Traditional medicine refers to codified or non-codified systems for health care and well-being, comprising practices, skills, knowledge and philosophies originating in different historical and cultural contexts, which are distinct from and pre-date biomedicine, evolving with science for current use from an experience-based origin. Traditional medicine emphasizes nature-based remedies and holistic, personalized approaches to restore balance of mind, body and environment. WHO definitions of traditional, complementary and herbal medicines."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "How widely is traditional medicine used?", "answer": "Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) is used in 170 countries, according to a 2019 WHO report. Further insight comes from WHO’s third global survey on TCIM. Sixty-seven per cent of respondents reported 40-99% of their populations using TCIM. These figures highlight the widespread and variable use of TCIM globally, emphasizing the need for clear definitions and consistent data collection to guide effective policy, regulation, and integration within health systems."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "Why is WHO working on traditional medicine?", "answer": "For centuries, traditional, indigenous and ancestral knowledge has been an integral resource for health in households and communities, and it continues to form a significant part of health care in many regions. 170 of WHO’s 194 Member States have reported on the use of herbal medicines, acupuncture, yoga, indigenous therapies and other systems of traditional medicine. Many countries recognize traditional medicine as a valuable source of health care and have taken steps to integrate practices, products, and practitioners into their national systems. Today, traditional medicine has become a global phenomenon; the demand is growing, with patients seeking greater agency and ownership of their health and well-being and seeking more holistic and personalized health care. For millions, especially those living in remote and rural areas, it continues to be the first choice for health and well-being, offering care that is culturally acceptable, available, and affordable. Yet less than 1% of global health research funding is currently dedicated to traditional medicine. Lack of investment in research undermines efforts to build a robust evidence base. WHO’s work on traditional medicine is a response to requests from countries for evidence and data to inform policies and practice, global standards, and regulations to ensure safety, quality, and equitable access. The 2018 Declaration of Astana on primary health care acknowledges the need to include traditional medicine knowledge and technologies in the delivery of primary health care – a cornerstone of health systems – in pursuit of health for all."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "What is WHO’s position on traditional medicine?", "answer": "WHO recognizes the diversity of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) practices across countries of the world and its contribution to health, well-being, people-centred health care and universal health coverage. Appropriately integrated TCIM can improve health outcomes by increasing the availability of services, especially at the level of primary health care. Integration of TCIM within national health systems must be done appropriately, effectively, and safely, based on the latest scientific evidence. WHO supports countries that want to embrace traditional medicine practices to do so in a science-based manner to avoid patient harm and ensure safe, effective, and quality health care. An evidence-based approach to traditional medicine, establishing efficacy and safety through rigorous scientific validation, is crucial, even if they have been used for a long period. This not only guarantees that treatment is effective and safe, but provides the rigorous evidence needed for the recommendation of traditional medicine in WHO guidelines. Non-medicinal therapies (e.g. yoga and acupuncture) provide an additional challenge in that there is clearly wide variability in their practice and performing randomized controlled-clinical trials is extremely difficult if not impossible. Concerted efforts to develop new methodologies that provide credible and robust evidence to recommend their use for specific health conditions are needed."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "What does WHO’s work on traditional medicine entail?", "answer": "WHO supports countries in promoting the safe, effective, and people-centred use of TCIM as part of efforts to achieve universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2025–2034 guides this work, focusing on strengthening quality, safety, appropriate use, and the integration of TCI based on evidence, innovation, and respect for cultural diversity and biodiversity. To further support this work, WHO established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India in 2022 as a global hub for knowledge, innovation, and partnerships. WHO’s TCIM work is structured around four key areas: leadership: providing global direction through the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Strategy 2025–2034, setting vision and priorities for member States; research and data: establishing research priorities, reviews evidence, and uses advanced technologies to generate robust data for evidence-informed decision-making; norms, standards, regulation, and integration: developing international standards for terminology, quality, and safety of TCIM products, practices, and practitioners; supports countries in building regulatory systems and integrating TCIM into health systems; and partnerships: fostering collaboration with stakeholders to advance TCIM on the global health agenda, mobilize resources, and strengthen political commitment toward shared goals. Through these areas, WHO helps countries safely and effectively integrate TCIM into health systems, contributing to better health outcomes and more inclusive, culturally responsive care."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "How can we ensure patient safety?", "answer": "In health-care systems, safety outcomes depend on a combination of factors such as practitioner competence, product quality, effective communication, and strong regulatory support. Adverse events, medication errors, or compromised product quality can arise in any field of health care, not because the systems themselves are unsafe, but because safety relies on how care is delivered. Both traditional medicine and biomedicine have established approaches to promoting safety. When supported by appropriate training, quality assurance, and clear practice frameworks, traditional medicine is usually a safe and trusted source of healing. As in biomedicine, strengthening patient safety in traditional medicine also involves augmenting the broader health-care environment around it. This may include improving documentation, supporting research, ensuring consistent quality standards, and building regulatory systems that protect both practitioners and patients. By focusing on these enabling factors, traditional medicine can continue to contribute safely and effectively to public health."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "How does traditional medicine complement biomedical care?", "answer": "Traditional medicine complements biomedicine by delivering holistic, person-centred, and culturally responsive care. It emphasizes prevention and balance – body, mind, and environment – while addressing lifestyle and psychosocial factors often overlooked in conventional treatment. Therapies like acupuncture, herbal medicine, and yoga are increasingly used alongside biomedical interventions to ease pain, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for chronic conditions. In many communities, traditional medicine offers trusted, accessible care where biomedical services are limited. Integrating safe, evidence-informed traditional medicine into health systems expands primary health care and strengthens equity, while collaboration between practitioners of biomedicine and TCIM builds trust and coordinated care. Scientific study of traditional medicine can also unlock new therapeutic insights, creating synergy that improves outcomes and delivers truly comprehensive health care."}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "Are TCIM products and practices subjected to same scrutiny as modern pharmaceuticals?", "answer": "Many countries have a long and rich heritage of traditional medicines and have integrated it into their national health-care delivery systems to varying degrees. A common challenge is monitoring the safety of traditional medicine products, especially the setting up systems of pharmacovigilance for traditional medicine products . Given the wide use of traditional medicine worldwide, monitoring its safety is an important and prioritized area of work. WHO encourages countries that do not already have them to establish integrated pharmacovigilance systems for both conventional pharmaceuticals and TCIM products. Generally speaking, TCIM products and practices are subjected to the same scrutiny (regulation, safety, and quality control) as pharmaceuticals; 124 WHO Member States have passed laws or regulation for herbal medicines. To support countries, WHO has published guidelines for the quality, safety, and efficacy of herbal medicine, including: WHO guidelines on selection of substances of herbal origin for quality control of herbal medicines Quality control methods for herbal materials WHO guidelines on assessing quality of herbal medicines with reference to contaminants and residues WHO guidelines on good manufacturing practices for herbal medicines WHO guidelines on good agricultural and collection practices for medicinal plants"}
{"topic": "/traditional-medicine", "question": "What is the contribution of TCIM to modern medicine and health?", "answer": "Around 40% of pharmaceutical products today have a natural product basis, and breakthrough drugs derive from traditional medicine. Traditional medicine has contributed to breakthrough medical discoveries and there is a long history of herbal medicine being translated into effective treatments for health conditions. The discovery of aspirin drew on traditional medicine formulations using the bark of the willow tree; the contraceptive pill was developed from the roots of wild yam plants; and child cancer treatments have been based on the rosy periwinkle. Nobel prize winning research on artemisinin for malaria control started with a review of ancient Chinese medicine texts. The discovery of the smallpox vaccine, which has led to the eradication of the disease, was inspired by ancient inoculation practices by communities around the world. A remarkable and rapid modernization of the ways traditional medicine is being studied can help realize the potential and promise of traditional medicine and traditional knowledge, for health and well-being. Taking clues from traditional uses, new clinically effective drugs can be identified through research such as ethnopharmacology and reverse pharmacology. The application of modern technologies in health and medicine can open new frontiers of knowledge on traditional medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a game-changer, revolutionizing the study and practice of traditional healing systems. AI’s advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities can allow researchers to explore extensive traditional medical knowledge, map evidence and identify once elusive trends."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "What is TB?", "answer": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) that most often affect the lungs. About one-quarter of the world's population has been infected with TB bacteria. In general, people with TB infection don’t feel sick and are not contagious."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "How many people die from TB disease?", "answer": "TB is the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. In 2024, 1.23 million people died from TB. This includes 150 000 people who were living with HIV."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "How does TB infection differ from TB disease?", "answer": "Most people infected with TB bacteria do not have TB disease, but they can develop TB. About 5–10% of people infected with TB will eventually develop TB disease. However, people with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, who are undernourished, are diabetics, or use tobacco, have a much higher risk of developing TB disease. Some persons with TB disease only have mild symptoms and some don’t have any at all. This can lead to delays in seeking care and continued transmission of the bacteria to others. Treatment for TB infection is different from treatment for TB disease."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "What are the symptoms of TB disease?", "answer": "TB often affects the lungs and can lead to several symptoms. A common sign of active TB is a persistent cough, sometimes with mucus or even blood. People might also experience chest pain, weakness or fatigue, unintentional weight loss, fever and night sweats. It's important to remember that these symptoms can be absent or mild at first and develop slowly."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "How does TB spread?", "answer": "TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB breathe, speak, cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. People with untreated TB can infect up to 10–15 other people through close contact over one year."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "How is TB diagnosed?", "answer": "WHO recommends the use of rapid diagnostic tests as the initial diagnostic tests in all persons with symptoms of TB. Increased use of these tests will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB. Diagnosing drug-resistant forms of TB, including multidrug-resistant TB, requires specific tests. Screening using chest X-ray and other tools can detect TB disease early on, including in individuals who do not have symptoms. In people without TB disease but who are at increased risk of TB, tests of TB infection can be used to identity individuals who will benefit most from preventive treatment."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "How is TB treated?", "answer": "Tuberculosis is mostly curable but without proper treatment, about two thirds of people who get TB will die. Since 2000, about 83 million lives have been saved through effective diagnosis and treatment. Most people who have TB disease can be cured with a course of 4 antimicrobials lasting 6 months, or even 4 months in some cases. Information, supervision and patient support by a health worker or trained volunteer are key to a successful outcome."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis", "question": "How is TB prevented?", "answer": "Tuberculosis is largely preventable. TB preventive treatment (TPT) can be given to avoid progression from TB infection to disease in people at risk. TB screening and action on poverty, undernutrition, HIV, diabetes and tobacco are some of the population measures that can reduce TB burden. The currently licensed vaccine – BCG – protects from severe forms of TB and from deaths from TB, especially in young children."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "What is vaccination?", "answer": "Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting you against harmful diseases, before you come into contact with them. It uses your body’s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger. Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications. Most vaccines are given by an injection, but some are given orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nose."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "How does a vaccine work?", "answer": "Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It: recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria; produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease; and r emembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell. The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness. Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "Why should I get vaccinated?", "answer": "Without vaccines, we are at risk of serious illness and disability from diseases like measles, meningitis, pneumonia, tetanus and polio. Many of these diseases can be life-threatening. WHO estimates that childhood vaccines alone save over 4 million lives every year. Although some diseases may have become uncommon, the germs that cause them continue to circulate in some or all parts of the world. In today’s world, infectious diseases can easily cross borders, and infect anyone who is not protected Two key reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. Because not everyone can be vaccinated – including very young babies, those who are seriously ill or have certain allergies – they depend on others being vaccinated to ensure they are also safe from vaccine-preventable diseases."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "When should I get vaccinated (or vaccinate my child)?", "answer": "Vaccines protect us throughout life and at different ages, from birth to childhood, as teenagers and into old age. In most countries you will be given a vaccination card that tells you what vaccines you or your child have had and when the next vaccines or booster doses are due. It is important to make sure that all these vaccines are up to date. If we delay vaccination, we are at risk of getting seriously sick. If we wait until we think we may be exposed to a serious illness – like during a disease outbreak – there may not be enough time for the vaccine to work and to receive all the recommended doses. If you have missed any recommended vaccinations for you or your child, talk to your healthcare worker about catching up."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "What diseases do vaccines prevent?", "answer": "Vaccines protect against many different diseases , including: Cervical cancer Cholera COVID-19 Diphtheria Ebola virus disease Hepatitis B Influenza Japanese encephalitis Malaria Measles Meningitis Mpox Mumps Pertussis Pneumonia Polio Rabies Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Rotavirus Rubella Tetanus Typhoid Varicella Yellow fever Some other vaccines are currently under development or being piloted, including those that protect against Zika virus, HIV or tuberculosis. Not all of these vaccinations may be needed in your country. Some may only be given prior to travel, in areas of risk, or to people in high-risk occupations. Talk to your healthcare worker to find out what vaccinations are needed for you and your family."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "Who can get vaccinated?", "answer": "Nearly everyone can get vaccinated. However, because of some medical conditions, some people should not get certain vaccines, or should wait before getting them. These conditions can include: chronic illnesses or treatments (like chemotherapy) that affect the immune system; s evere and life-threatening allergies to vaccine ingredients, which are very rare; and i f you have severe illness and a high fever on the day of vaccination. These factors often vary for each vaccine. If you’re not sure if you or your child should get a particular vaccine, talk to your health worker. They can help you make an informed choice about vaccination for you or your child."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "What is in a vaccine?", "answer": "All the ingredients in a vaccine play an important role in ensuring a vaccine is safe and effective. These ingredients, as well as the vaccines themselves, have been thoroughly tested and are monitored to ensure they are safe. These ingredients include: the antigen . Antigens can be a killed or weakened form of a virus or      bacteria, or a part of it, or genetic instructions (RNA or DNA) that tell our      cells to make the antigen. Antigens train our bodies to recognize the germ      and respond if exposed in the future; adjuvants . These help vaccines work better by boosting our immune response.  Adjuvants like aluminium salts have been      safely used in vaccines, helping them provide better and longer-lasting      protection; preservatives . These help keep vaccines safe and effective by preventing contamination      from germs that can grow in vaccine vials. An example is thiomersal, which      has been safely used in some vaccines for decades; and stabilisers . These protect vaccines during storage and transport, supporting their      safety and efficacy even when exposed to heat, light and other      environmental changes. Common stabilisers include sugar and gelatin. Vaccine ingredients may look unfamiliar when they are listed on a label. However, many of the components used in vaccines occur naturally in the body, in the environment, and in the food we eat."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "Is it safe to receive several different vaccines during one visit, or combination vaccines?", "answer": "Yes, it is safe to receive several different vaccines during one visit. Combination vaccines are also as safe and effective as individual vaccines. Receiving several vaccines or combination vaccines in one visit is important to protect children from various diseases as early as possible. This also makes it easier to complete the recommended doses on time. Combination vaccines (e.g. DTP for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) reduce the number of injections. Receiving multiple doses also does not overwhelm the immune system. The antigens present in vaccines are a small fraction compared to what our bodies naturally encounter every day."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination", "question": "I still have questions about vaccination. What should I do?", "answer": "If you have questions about vaccines be sure to talk to your health-care worker. They can provide you with trusted advice about vaccination for you and your family, including the recommended vaccination schedule in your country. When looking online for information about vaccines, be sure to consult only trustworthy sources. To help you find them, WHO has reviewed and ‘certified’ many websites across the world that provide only information based on reliable scientific evidence and independent reviews by leading technical experts. These websites are all members of the Vaccine Safety Net ."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Is there a vaccine against Ebola disease?", "answer": "Currently there are two licensed Ebola vaccines prequalified by WHO for Ebola virus disease (EVD) caused by Ebola virus (species Orthoebolavirus zairense ). Ervebo® vaccine, administered in one dose. Zabdeno® and Mvabea® vaccine, administered in a two-dose regimen. The Ervebo® vaccine is recommended for use in outbreak settings and is currently the only vaccine available in the global stockpile. As part of outbreak response, a CORE protocol to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccine candidates is available. See the July 2024 WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommendations for further information."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Are there vaccines for other species of orthoebolavirus?", "answer": "There are at least three species of orthoebolaviruses known to cause large outbreaks in humans: Ebola virus (EBOV) causing Ebola virus disease (EVD) Sudan virus (SUDV) causing Sudan virus disease (SVD) Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) causing Bundibugyo virus disease (BVD). While there are only licensed vaccines for EVD, several candidate vaccines are at different stages of development."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Have these vaccines been used before?", "answer": "The Ervebo vaccine has been used under “expanded access” or what is also known as “compassionate use” for 16 000 people in Guinea in 2015 and for 345 000 people during the 2018-2020 outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine was studied in a total of 3 367 adults, adolescents and children who participated in 5 clinical studies conducted in Europe, Africa and the United States of America. These studies demonstrated that the vaccine regimen is safe and could induce an immune response against the Ebola virus. Efficacy data in humans has been extrapolated from animal studies. The exact level of protection provided by the vaccine regimen is not yet fully known."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "When are Ebola vaccines used?", "answer": "Ervebo® is the only vaccine currently available for outbreak response. There is a global Ebola vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on vaccine provision. This stockpile allows WHO, countries and other partners to contain future EVD outbreaks by ensuring equitable and timely access to vaccines for populations most at risk during outbreaks. When an outbreak of EVD is confirmed, countries can request vaccines through the ICG. The ICG will provide vaccines and operational cost support to eligible countries."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Who is eligible for the Ebola vaccine during an outbreak?", "answer": "Those eligible for the Ebola vaccine during an outbreak are: all people who have come into direct or indirect contact with a confirmed or a probable case; and frontline and health-care workers because they are at the highest risk of contracting the disease during an EVD outbreak response. Included are clinicians and nurses who treat patients, surveillance and contact tracing teams, laboratory staff, safe burial teams, community workers, traditional healers, drivers and other community key stakeholders who are likely to interact with confirmed or probable cases."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "What vaccination strategies are recommended?", "answer": "Vaccination is an important component of outbreak response. The goal is to protect individuals at highest risk, using a ring vaccination or targeted geographic strategy."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Can the vaccine cause adverse effects?", "answer": "In vaccine studies conducted since 2015, most of the adverse effects were typically mild. Vaccinated individuals most commonly reported headache, fatigue, muscle pain and mild fever."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "What is ring vaccination?", "answer": "A ring vaccination strategy is one that h as been used to contain disease outbreaks by vaccinating the close contacts and potential contacts of a confirmed or probable case, creating a \"ring\" of immunity around a confirmed or probable case to prevent transmission. Someone is listed as a contact when he/she has been in touch with the body fluids (blood, vomit, saliva, urine, faeces, breast milk) or shared the linens, clothes, or dishes/eating utensils of a person with a confirmed or probable status of Ebola disease. Potential contacts are neighbours, family members, or extended family members at the closest geographic boundary of all contacts, plus household members of all contacts."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Is it possible for a person who has been vaccinated to still get infected with Ebola?", "answer": "No vaccine is 100 percent effective. Persons who receive the vaccine should continue to protect themselves from Ebola virus infection by not touching a patient’s body (dead or alive), or bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, saliva, urine or faeces. Personal items used by the patient like bedding and clothes may also be contaminated with Ebola virus and should be avoided. If a person receiving the vaccine was already infected with the Ebola virus before he/she was vaccinated, they could develop Ebola virus disease after they receive the vaccine. If they develop any symptom of illness, they should immediately contact the vaccination team."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "What is targeted geographic vaccination?", "answer": "A targeted geographic vaccination strategy involves vaccinating everyone in the neighbourhood, or village, rather than vaccinating only the known contacts and potential contacts. This approach can be used when the cases are contained within a small geographic area or when contact tracing is difficult (e.g. difficult to access areas or when contact tracing is not feasible as in poor security settings)."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Can children, pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?", "answer": "The Ervebo vaccine is indicated in individuals of 12 months of age and older. However, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommends “off label” use in outbreak settings depending on  risk factors including: children from birth pregnant and lactating women. This means that each country should make the decision on whether or not to offer the vaccine to these categories of the population, based on their vulnerabilities and exposure to the risk of Ebola infection. The Zabdeno and Mvabea vaccine regimen is also indicated for immunization in individuals over 12 months of age. Guidelines for the management of pregnant and breastfeeing women in the context of Ebola virus disease"}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Can Ebola virus disease survivors be vaccinated?", "answer": "People who survive EVD usually develop some natural protection against the disease. This protection is believed to last for several years, although it may slowly decrease over time. Ebola disease survivors are encouraged to apply all the protective measures against Ebola disease, including vaccination."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "What are the benefits of being vaccinated against Ebola virus disease?", "answer": "Vaccination against Ebola virus disease provides individual and collective immunity that reduces the harmful effects of the disease, including severe illness and death. Unvaccinated persons have a high risk of dying in case of infection and increase the risk of the spread of the virus within the community. It is important to ensure that all people at immediate risk of Ebola virus infection are immunized to protect themselves and others."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "What are the common side effects of Ebola virus disease vaccines?", "answer": "Most common side effects associated with Ebola virus disease vaccines are mild and occur within 24-48 hours of being vaccinated. After receiving the EVD vaccine, people can experience: injection site pain fever headache. Symptoms will generally disappear within 24 hours of onset."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "How long does the Ebola vaccine take to provide protection?", "answer": "According to evidence it takes between 10 and 14 days to develop a complete immune response. This means that a person can still get infected before the vaccine provides full protection."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Is it possible for a person who has been vaccinated to get infected with Ebola?", "answer": "Vaccines are not 100% effective. People vaccinated against Ebola can still be infected even when the vaccine has provided immunity in the body, and has provided good protection against a severe form of Ebola and even death. Furthermore, not all individuals respond to the vaccines in the same manner. If a person receiving the vaccine was already infected with the Ebola virus before he/she was vaccinated, they could develop Ebola virus disease after they receive the vaccine. If they develop any symptom of illness, they should immediately contact the vaccination team. People who have received the vaccine should continue to protect themselves. They should avoid touching a patient’s body (dead or alive), or their body fluids, including blood, vomit, tears, saliva, urine or faeces, as well as the patient’s personal items such as bedding and clothes."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Is it possible to contract Ebola virus from the vaccine?", "answer": "No, it is not possible to be infected with Ebola as a result of vaccination. The vaccine does not contain live virus."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "How long does immunity last following vaccination with an Ebola vaccine?", "answer": "Antibodies to the virus have been detected up to four years after vaccination. However, it is not known whether this level of antibodies is enough to protect against Ebola infection. Therefore, revaccination is recommended for anyone at high risk during an outbreak if they have not received an Ebola vaccine in the last six months."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Can a person get a subsequent dose with a different type of Ebola vaccine?", "answer": "There is no data available regarding receipt of a subsequent dose of an Ebola vaccine that is different to the one originally received. Research is ongoing to learn more about booster doses of licensed Ebola vaccines."}
{"topic": "/ebola-vaccines", "question": "Is vaccination the primary component of an Ebola outbreak control strategy?", "answer": "Vaccination is just one component of a strategy to control an Ebola outbreak. Other important components include: early detection of new Ebola infections through active surveillance; functional laboratory services to confirm Ebola infections; separating (isolating) patients to prevent further spread at home or in the community and to provide safe and supportive care; safely and respectfully burying the dead to reduce further spread of Ebola virus through contact with deceased patients; and systematically engaging communities from the start in the Ebola response."}

{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "What are the key areas of funding?", "answer": "Proposals should align with the AF’s mandate and may centre around building climate resilient health systems and facilities. Projects should be in line with national strategies/priorities such as the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP), national disease plans and others. Specific activities could indicatively include: assessing the climate change vulnerability of healthcare facilities (using the checklists) and undertaking interventions to improve their resilience; establishment/strengthening of climate-informed health surveillance and early warning systems; and developing plans to advance climate resilience and sustainable low-carbon health systems. These plans may comprise areas such as WASH, energy, health workforce, and infrastructure, technologies and supply chains (e.g., using the WHO guidance on Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Healthcare facilities). In the AF Operational Policies and Guidelines, a concrete adaptation project is defined as “a set of activities aimed at addressing the adverse impacts of and risks posed by climate change. The activities shall aim at producing visible and tangible results on the ground by reducing vulnerability and increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems to respond to the impacts of climate change, including climate variability. Adaptation projects/programmes can be implemented at the community, national, regional and transboundary level. Projects/programmes concern activities with a specific objective(s) and concrete outcome(s) and output(s) that are measurable, monitorable, and verifiable.”"}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "Is funding available for the development of proposals?", "answer": "Entities applying for regional projects (2+ countries) through the 3-step submission process (pre-concept note; concept note; fully developed proposal) or using the 2-step submission process (concept note; fully developed proposal) can ask for PFG according to the figures below: Project size below US$2M = PFG amount US$50,000 Project size US$2M but less than US$5M = PFG amount US$100,000 Project size US$5M and above =PFG amount US$150,000 LLA projects = PFG amount US$150,000 plus additional PFG up to US$100,000. (to tap into the additional US$100,000 requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis) Entities applying for single country projects through a 2-step submission process (concept note; fully developed proposal) with a concept note can request a Project Formulation Grant (PFG) according to the figures below: Project size below US$2M = PFG amount US$50,000 Project size US$2M but less than US$5M = PFG amount US$100,000 Project size US$5M and above =PFG amount US$150,000 LLA projects = PFG amount US$150,000 plus additional PFG up to US$100,000. (to tap into the additional US$100,000 requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis) The submission of pre-concept notes and/or concept notes is optional, i.e., entities may also opt to submit a full proposal directly. Opting for a 2-step or 3-step submission process can be useful to agree on and outline the activities suitable for implementation and financing through the AF, before committing time and resources in developing a full proposal. The specific process depends on the country/regional context and the maturity of the project/programme envisioned."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "Does the WHO support on the proposal development?", "answer": "If you are interested in developing an AF proposal on climate change and health, we would be happy to support you. Please send a message to adaptation.fund@who.int for more information."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "What can the WHO do as an AF Accredited Entity?", "answer": "WHO provides a multitude of services, including support to the development of proposals, support the monitoring and evaluation framework; implementation and supervision of the adaptation project/programme; financial management; progress reporting; and project completion and evaluation."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "Who needs to submit the AF proposal?", "answer": "The AF proposal can be submitted by WHO as an AF accredited entity; All proposals should be accompanied by one or several valid and complete Letter(s) of Endorsement duly signed by the Designated Authority for the country that is officially acknowledged by the Adaptation Fund (see here for the list). It is critical that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or equivalent government department) and other relevant government counterparts."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "Who will receive the AF funds?", "answer": "The funds will first be transferred to WHO headquarters. In a second step, the funds will be transferred to the WHO regional office or WHO country office, depending on the funding window chosen."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "Who is responsible for the implementation of the project activities?", "answer": "WHO is ultimately accountable for the implementation of project activities. Nevertheless, all activities must be in line with country priorities and therefore fully owned by the government, including the ministry of health and other relevant ministries."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "What are the first steps in developing an AF proposal?", "answer": "The following steps can be considered (constitute suggestions; the actual process will depend on the country context): identify the country-specific needs of the health sector in relation to climate change. Policy documents such as a climate health and change vulnerability and adaptation assessment, a Health National Adaptation Plan, and other related action plans may serve as a good reference point; identify the AF funding window that best matches the needs of the region or country; review the AF proposal materials, including templates used to apply for funding to identify which of  your country/regional needs are eligible for AF funding; in partnership with the ministry of health (MoH), formulate the needs and categorize them into relevant funding objectives; in partnership with the MoH, inform your Designated Authority about the opportunity and plan to develop an AF proposal, submitted through WHO as a Multilateral Implementing Entity; undertake a trilateral discussion between the Designated Authority, WHO and the MoH on the initial ideas of actions to be included in the proposal. This communication should be ongoing throughout the proposal development process; obtain valid and complete Letter(s) of Endorsement duly signed by the Designated Authority; and please see also the suggested steps for applying for AF funding through this link ."}
{"topic": "/who-as-an-accredited-entity-of-the-adaptation-fund", "question": "What are the deadlines for submitting an AF proposal?", "answer": "Proposals are considered at the Board’s regular meetings, held twice a year. Please contact WHO to learn about the date of the next AF Board meeting. Proposals should be submitted in advance of each scheduled AF Board meeting. This means that proposals submitted on or after the meeting will not be processed until after the Board meeting. Submitting the proposal well in advance to the AF Board meeting can enable a review by the AF Secretariat. A proposal that is envisioned to be considered by the Board needs to be technically cleared by the AF. It is unlikely for a proposal to be cleared on the first submission (although sometimes a pre-concept can be cleared with quick adjustments). Therefore, it is strongly recommend to send in the proposal as early as possible in order for it to undergo at least two rounds of reviews. Please note that in some instances, funds may not be readily available within the annual allocation for the window chosen. In this case, proposals may still be technically cleared by the board and be placed on a waitlist. Waitlisted projects/programmes will receive funding once additional funds are received by the AF. For further information see here."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "How do we know that a vaccine is safe?", "answer": "Most childhood vaccines have been in use for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year, routinely or in response to specific disease threats. Before any vaccine is introduced in a country, the vaccine undergoes rigorous and stringent testing through multiple phases of clinical trials. Health authorities carefully evaluate the results of these trials to help ensure that the vaccine meets the highest safety and efficacy standards before being considered suitable for use. Once vaccines are introduced and used in countries, national health authorities continuously monitor vaccine safety to detect and immediately respond to potential concerns. In case of an adverse event, details are collected from the event and an independent group of experts assesses whether such an event is related to vaccines or is due to other causes. WHO assists countries in strengthening vaccine safety monitoring and response systems. Countries share reports on adverse events with WHO. At the global level, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) ,  an independent group of experts, evaluates these reports and provides authoritative and scientific advice to WHO."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "Are there side effects from vaccines?", "answer": "Vaccines are very safe. Like any medicine, vaccines can cause side effects. However, these are usually very minor and of short duration, such as a sore arm or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible but extremely rare. If you or your child has an unexpected reaction after vaccination, consult with your health-care worker. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by a vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, meningitis, hepatitis B or polio can be deadly or cause severe illness and disability. Possible complications of these diseases can include blindness, deafness, paralysis, brain damage, infertility, cancer, birth defects and death."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "What is an Adverse Event Following Immunizaton (AEFI)", "answer": "An Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) is any unexpected medical issue that happens after a person gets a vaccine. The issue could be a symptom, an unusual test result, a coincidental illness or something unrelated. An AEFI doesn’t necessarily mean the vaccine caused it. Only in extremely rare cases is the vaccine found to be the cause of the AEFI. In the very rare cases when a vaccine causes an AEFI, it may be due to a reaction to the vaccine itself or an error such as improper storage. Immunization programmes take all necessary steps to ensure vaccines are stored, handled and given safely, and that any rare reactions are promptly investigated and managed."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "How are vaccines tested?", "answer": "Every vaccine is carefully tested at each step to ensure it is safe and effective before it is approved for use. A promising vaccine candidate will first undergo laboratory testing. This includes careful examination and testing of the vaccine candidate and its ingredients. These tests evaluate the safety of the vaccine candidate and how well it prevents a disease. If positive results are achieved in the laboratory, a manufacturer can then apply to do clinical trials. These trials typically involve following up with several thousands of vaccinated healthy volunteers. The trials are also carefully monitored by national regulatory authorities. The trials are bound by strict regulations and take place across three main phases: During Phase I, small groups (for instance, approximately 20-50 people) receive the vaccine. This phase will assess the safety, side effects, appropriate dosage, method of administration and composition of the vaccine. If it is successful, it will proceed to Phase II. At this stage, the vaccine is usually given to several hundred people. This group will have the same characteristics (e.g. age, sex) as the people for whom the vaccine is intended to be given. In Phase III, the vaccine is usually given to thousands of people to help ensure it is safe and effective for broader use. The results of all these studies will be assessed when regulators decide whether to approve a vaccine. Additional studies may also take place after a vaccine is introduced. They enable scientists to monitor efficacy and safety among an even larger number of people over a longer timeframe."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "How are vaccines approved for public use?", "answer": "In countries where vaccines are manufactured, national or regional regulators oversee the vaccine’s development. This includes approving clinical trials, evaluating their results, and making decisions on licensing. All decisions must adhere to strict international standards on ethical clinical practice. The national regulatory authority (NRA) of each country decides if a vaccine will be introduced in the country’s immunization programme. To assist NRAs, WHO offers a process called prequalification. Prequalification facilitates informed decision-making on the approval and procurement of vaccines, especially in countries with limited resources for conducting extensive evaluations. In prequalification, WHO independently assesses evidence on the quality, safety, and efficacy of vaccines and other medical products, helping ensure that only those that meet stringent international standards are used in public health programmes."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "How is vaccine safety monitored?", "answer": "Like all medicines, vaccines continue to be monitored for safety even after they have been tested in clinical trials and introduced for public use. Vaccine safety is monitored at local, national, regional and global levels. WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health authorities, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor, quickly detect and review any possible safety concerns. WHO helps countries build and strengthen robust vaccine safety systems, enabling national immunization programmes and regulatory agencies to detect and respond to vaccine safety issues. When a serious event happens after vaccination, independent experts carefully assess whether it is related to the vaccine or due to another cause. Globally, WHO supports countries through the Uppsala Monitoring Centre , a WHO collaborating centre in Sweden, which collects reports of vaccine safety events worldwide; and the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) ,  an independent group of experts that reviews vaccine safety data and advises WHO."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "What happens if a problem is suspected with a vaccine?", "answer": "If a potential problem is identified following vaccination, a thorough investigation will take place. Investigations involve a detailed examination of the case, including medical assessment. If necessary, studies are conducted. During these investigations, it is extremely rare that health problems are found to be caused by the vaccine itself. Health events are most often found to be coincidental, i.e. entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes, events are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported or administered (for instance, errors are made in preparing the vaccine). Such errors can be prevented by training health workers and strengthening vaccination programmes. In the rare cases where a genuine adverse reaction is suspected, the vaccine may be suspended from use. Further investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event. Programmes will then need to put corrective measures in place."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "How does WHO help ensure vaccine safety?", "answer": "WHO works to ensure that everyone, everywhere, is protected by safe and effective vaccines. To do this, WHO helps countries set up rigorous safety systems for vaccines – alongside other medicines – and work to develop the strictest standards for their regulation. Together with external scientists, WHO experts continuously monitor and update the safety profile of vaccines. With external partners, it also helps countries investigate and communicate if potential issues of concern arise. Events that are reported to WHO are evaluated by an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety , or GACVS). On behalf of this Committee, WHO issues regular statements on vaccine safety."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "Is there a link between vaccines and autism?", "answer": "No. Extensive research has shown that vaccines do not cause autism. Many large, high-quality studies conducted in different countries and involving large populations have all reached the same conclusion. The concern started with a 1998 study that suggested a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism. The study was later proven to be wrong and fraudulent. The journal that published it withdrew the study, and the doctor who authored it lost his medical license. Unfortunately, the fear that the study created caused some parents to stop vaccinating their children, which led to outbreaks of diseases that the vaccine could have prevented. For more information, refer to the WHO fact sheet on autism ."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "What is thiomersal, and is it safe in vaccines?", "answer": "Thiomersal (also called thimerosal) is a preservative in some multi-dose vaccine vials. It helps prevent germs from getting into the vial each time a dose is drawn. Thiomersal contains ethylmercury, which does not accumulate in the body because it is broken down and eliminated quickly. Ethylmercury is different from methylmercury, the type of mercury that can accumulate in certain fish and seafood and can pose health risks. Extensive research shows that the small amount of thiomersal used in vaccines does not cause harm. There is no link between thiomersal and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety", "question": "Are aluminium-containing vaccines safe?", "answer": "Yes. WHO continues to review scientific evidence and confirms that aluminium-containing vaccines are safe. Aluminium salts have been safely used in some vaccines for decades. They are added to vaccines as adjuvants, compounds that help the body build a stronger and longer-lasting immune response. The amount of aluminium in vaccines is very small and much less than people are naturally exposed to over time. The total exposure to aluminium salts in the entire routine childhood vaccine schedule is far lower than from a normal diet. Extensive research, including a recent study of over one million children (2), has found no link between aluminium-containing vaccines and any serious health problems, including autism."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "What is autism?", "answer": "Autism – also referred to as autism spectrum disorder – constitutes a diverse group of conditions related to development of the brain. Characteristics may be detected in early childhood, but autism is often not diagnosed until much later. Autism is characterised by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations. The abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others require life-long care and support. Inclusion in education and meaningful employment are fundamental rights for all individuals, including those with autism. Societal attitudes and the level of support and services provided by local and national authorities are important factors determining the quality of life of people with autism."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "How common is autism?", "answer": "Reviews estimate that 1 person in 127 is autistic. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "Do autistic people also have an intellectual disability?", "answer": "The level of intellectual functioning is extremely variable among autistic people and can range from profound impairment to high-functioning. It is estimated that around 50% of autistic people have an intellectual disability."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "How early can autism be recognized in children?", "answer": "Identifying autism is difficult before the age of about 12 months but diagnosis is generally possible by the age of 2 years. Characteristic features of onset include delay in the development of, or regression in, language and social skills and repetitive patterns of behaviour."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "What can parents and other caregivers do to help an autistic child enjoy opportunities to grow, learn and access care?", "answer": "Parents and other caregivers have an essential role in promoting the development and well-being of their autistic child by offering nurturing and stimulating environments at home and opportunities for participation in family and day-to-day activities. They can help to ensure access to health, education and other services and opportunities available to all children in their communities. It is important that health-care workers are provided with training on autism and person- and family-centred care so that they are able to recognize and value neurodiversity and support people with autism and their caregivers in the most appropriate and responsive way. Recognizing the preferences and needs of individuals is important, as is promoting informed decision-making and autonomy. Collaboration between the health sector and other sectors, particularly education, employment and social care, is equally important."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "What causes autism?", "answer": "Scientific evidence suggests that various factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the onset of autism by influencing early brain development. Studies show an increased likelihood of autism for families with an autistic member and particularly for identical twins. Scientific studies show that exposure to certain environmental factors appear to occur more frequently in children with autism, or their parents. These include advanced parental age, maternal diabetes during pregnancy, prenatal exposure to air pollutants or certain heavy metals, prematurity, severe birth complications and low birth weight. In addition, research studies have looked into a possible association between use of various medicines during pregnancy and increased risk for autism. For example, prenatal exposure to valproate and carbamazepine, which are used for seizures, appear to occur more frequently in children with autism. More research is needed to better understand the role of each of the factors that appear to be associated with a higher risk for autism, and how they interact with genetic variations. Autism is not caused by bad parenting or vaccines and vaccine ingredients, and is not linked to diet. It is also not an infection and cannot be spread to other people."}
{"topic": "/autism-spectrum-disorders-(asd)", "question": "Is there a link between vaccines and autism?", "answer": "No. Extensive research has shown that vaccines do not cause autism. Many large, high-quality studies conducted in different countries and involving large populations have all reached the same conclusion. Research using a variety of different methods and conducted over many years has demonstrated that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine does not cause autism. The study that was interpreted as indicating any such link was later proven to be wrong and fraudulent. The journal that published it withdrew the study, and the doctor who authored it lost his medical license. Evidence also shows that other childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism. Extensive research into the preservative thiomersal and the additive aluminium that are contained in some vaccines strongly concluded that these constituents in childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "What is workplace heat stress?", "answer": "Workplace heat stress describes circumstances under which a worker's body accumulates heat due to the combined effects of metabolic heat, environmental factors and clothing worn. Workplace heat stress causes physiological heat strain in the body that can lead to exhaustion, pathological conditions and death."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "How many people are affected?", "answer": "More than 2.4 billion workers are exposed to excessive heat globally, resulting in more than 22.85 million occupational injuries each year. More than one third of all persons who frequently work in hot conditions experience physiological heat strain."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "What health problems does heat stress cause?", "answer": "Heat stress is associated with clinical symptoms such as hyperthermia (elevated body temperature), syncope (dizziness/fainting), impaired kidney function, dehydration and neurological dysfunction. A systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that 35% of individuals who frequently work under workplace heat stress experience heat-related illnesses, including heat exhaustion and heat stroke."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "How does heat affect work productivity?", "answer": "Worker productivity decreases by 2–3% for every degree increase beyond 20°C in Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (a measure of heat stress that takes into account air temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle, and cloud cover) 1 . Recent data from about 8000 workers showed that 30% of those frequently working under workplace heat stress conditions report labour productivity losses. 1 Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is a way to measure how hot it really feels to the human body when we combine: air temperature (how hot the air is); humidity (how much water vapor is in the air); sunlight or other sources of radiant heat (direct sun and hot objects at work make it much hotter); and wind (the air flow from a breeze, a fan or natural ventilation can cool you down). This is more accurate than just looking at a thermometer, because our bodies are affected by heat, moisture, air flow and radiant heat combined."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "Are indoor workers at risk too?", "answer": "Yes, indoor workers are at risk of heat stress. Examples are people working in occupations where they are exposed to very hot environments such as when furnaces are present or working in hot and humid environments, such as coal mining green houses. Even those working in manufacturing and service industries where there are no cooling devices are at risk. In addition, jobs involving intense physical activities and/or that require wearing full personal protective equipment or other types of special clothing, are likely to experience greater physiological heat strain."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "What temperature is safe for work?", "answer": "To sustain an eight-hour work shift, core body temperature should not exceed 38°C. Sustaining higher core body temperatures raises the risk of heat-related injuries, primarily for people who are more vulnerable to heat such as older workers, individuals with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, people working outdoors or those performing very intense physical jobs."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "What warning signs should workers watch for?", "answer": "Mild health outcomes include heat fatigue, miliaria (heat rash), syncope, and heat cramps. Severe health outcomes requiring emergency response include heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition defined by profound central nervous system dysfunction and severe hyperthermia."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "Who is most at risk?", "answer": "Middle-aged and older workers, individuals with chronic health conditions, and those with lower physical fitness are more susceptible to the effects of heat stress. However, unfavourable consequences have been observed even in low-risk individuals who follow sound heat mitigation procedures. International migrant workers are at higher risk as they often have less work experience, poorer perception of health risks, are not acclimatized to the local environment, and are more likely to work in manual labour occupations requiring outdoor work."}
{"topic": "/workplace-heat-stress", "question": "What can be done to protect workers?", "answer": "WHO recommends developing Occupational Heat Action Programmes that include occupational heat-health policies with tailored plans and advisories that consider local weather patterns, specific jobs, and worker vulnerabilities. This includes education and awareness raising for first responders, health professionals, employers and workers to recognize and properly treat heat stress symptoms, and engaging all stakeholders in co-creating heat-health strategies."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "Where is paragonimiasis most commonly found?", "answer": "Paragonimiasis is endemic in tropical and some subtropical regions of Asia (e.g., China, Philippines, Thailand), Africa (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Cameroon), and America (e.g., USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador) (1,2).  It is prevalent in areas where people consume raw or undercooked freshwater crustaceans (e.g., crabs, crayfish)."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "Why are certain cultural practices linked to paragonimiasis?", "answer": "In many endemic regions, traditional dishes like raw crab salad or marinated crayfish are popular. These practices increase the risk of ingesting Paragonimus larvae, which are not killed without adequate cooking."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "Is paragonimiasis a neglected tropical disease?", "answer": "Yes. Paragonimiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease (NTD) because it primarily affects marginalized, rural communities with limited access to healthcare and education about food safety."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "How do humans get infected with Paragonimus?", "answer": "Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked freshwater crustaceans (crabs, crayfish) containing Paragonimus larvae. The larvae migrate through the intestines and diaphragm to the lungs, where they mature into adult flukes."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "Can I get paragonimiasis from drinking water or swimming?", "answer": "No, paragonimiasis is not spread by drinking contaminated water or swimming in freshwater. Infection happens only when people eat raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish that are infected with the parasite. Avoiding raw freshwater seafood is the key to preventing this disease."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "What socioeconomic factors fuel paragonimiasis transmission?", "answer": "Paragonimiasis transmission is influenced by several socioeconomic factors, including poverty, inadequate sanitation, and limited access to healthcare. Communities relying on freshwater sources for drinking and food preparation are at higher risk, as the parasite is transmitted through consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater crustaceans. Low levels of health education contribute to continued transmission, as people may be unaware of the risks associated with consuming contaminated food. In endemic areas, subsistence fishing and traditional dietary practices increase exposure to the parasite. Strengthening health education, improving sanitation, and expanding access to diagnostic and treatment services are critical to reducing the burden of paragonimiasis"}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "What are the symptoms of paragonimiasis?", "answer": "Symptoms include chronic cough, chest pain, bloody sputum, and difficulty breathing, mimicking tuberculosis. In rare cases, the parasite migrates to the brain, causing headaches, seizures, or neurological damage"}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "Why is paragonimiasis often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis?", "answer": "The symptoms of pulmonary paragonimiasis closely resemble those of tuberculosis (TB), leading to frequent misdiagnosis, particularly in regions where TB is prevalent. Both conditions can present with chronic cough, chest pain, and abnormal lung findings on imaging. Accurate diagnosis requires specific laboratory tests, such as sputum or stool examinations for parasite eggs or serological assays. In some co-endemic regions, such as the Philippines, integrated surveillance programs for both paragonimiasis and TB have been implemented to reduce misdiagnosis and improve disease management."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "What are the treatment options for paragonimiasis?", "answer": "The current first-line treatment for paragonimiasis is triclabendazole. Praziquantel may also be used as an alternative if triclabendazole is not available. Treatment is generally effective, but follow-up may be needed to ensure the infection is fully cleared."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-paragonimiasis", "question": "What challenges exist in controlling paragonimiasis?", "answer": "Limited awareness, lack of diagnostic tools, and cultural resistance to changing traditional food practices hinder control efforts. Improving sanitation and educating communities about safe food preparation are critical."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "What regions are most affected by opisthorchiasis?", "answer": "Opisthorchiasis is endemic in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, PDR Lao, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as parts of Eastern Europe and Russia. High prevalence is linked to cultural practices of eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "What socioeconomic factors fuel opisthorchiasis transmission?", "answer": "Opisthorchiasis transmission is strongly influenced by poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, which lead to the contamination of water bodies with parasite eggs. These unsanitary conditions, combined with the consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish—a common dietary practice in some communities—sustain the cycle of infection. Low levels of health literacy and lack of awareness about the risks associated with consuming raw fish contribute to continued infections. Additionally, insufficient healthcare access leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, prolonging the disease burden in affected populations. Sustainable control measures should include improved sanitation, education campaigns on safe food preparation, and increased healthcare accessibility in endemic areas."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms of opisthorchiasis?", "answer": "In humans, both acute opisthorchiasis viverrini and opisthorchiasis felinea may be asymptomatic or scarcely symptomatic in light infections, but if the number of worms is significant (up to several thousands), fever and right upper-quadrant pain are not infrequent and may be associated with intermittent colic pain caused by obstruction of the gallbladder by the worms themselves. Typically, opisthorchiasis felinea is associated with a more pronounced and severe acute phase than opisthorchiasis viverrini or clonorchiasis. Chronic opisthorchiasis viverrini, which results from protracted episodes of re-infection over time, may be most severe. The presence of the worms in the smaller bile ducts causes chronic inflammation of their walls, resulting in fibrosis of the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis may also be frequent. Chronic opisthorchiasis viverrini is strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma, a severe and often fatal form of bile duct cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies O. viverrini as a Group 1 agent (carcinogenic to humans). Not much information is available on chronic opisthorchiasis felinea: the presence of the worms in the smaller bile ducts is likely to cause chronic inflammation of their walls, resulting in fibrosis of the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis may be present. There is insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between opisthorchiasis felinea and cholangiocarcinoma or other forms of liver cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies O. felineus as a Group 3 agent (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans)."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "How does opisthorchiasis spread to humans?", "answer": "Humans become infected by eating raw, undercooked, or fermented freshwater fish containing Opisthorchis viverrini or O. felineus larvae. The larvae mature into adult flukes in the bile ducts, where they lay eggs excreted in stool."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "Can pets or livestock spread opisthorchiasis?", "answer": "Yes. Cats, dogs, and other fish-eating mammals can act as reservoir hosts, shedding parasite eggs in their feces. This sustains the lifecycle in water systems, emphasizing the need for veterinary action in endemic areas."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "Why are raw fish dishes like koi pla still popular despite opisthorchiasis risks?", "answer": "Dishes like koi pla (Thailand) are deeply rooted in cultural traditions. Effective public health campaigns must balance respect for cultural practices with education on safer preparation methods, such as freezing or thoroughly cooking fish."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "What are the long-term health effects of opisthorchiasis?", "answer": "Chronic infection causes bile duct inflammation, fibrosis, and obstruction, increasing the risk of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Early treatment is critical to prevent these complications."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "How does opisthorchiasis affect children compared to adults?", "answer": "Children in endemic areas often experience malnutrition and stunted growth due to chronic infection. Early exposure increases lifetime cancer risk, as bile duct damage accumulates over decades."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-opisthorchiasis", "question": "What are the limitations of praziquantel for opisthorchiasis treatment?", "answer": "While praziquantel is effective at killing adult Opisthorchis flukes, it has several limitations. First, it cannot reverse existing damage to the bile ducts caused by long-term infections, such as scarring, inflammation, or an increased risk of bile duct cancer. Second, it does not kill the younger stages of the parasite, which may continue to grow after treatment. Third, praziquantel does not prevent people from getting infected again, so individuals in endemic areas who keep eating raw or undercooked fish remain at risk. Additionally, in areas where many people are infected, relying only on mass treatment without improving sanitation, clean water, and food safety limits the impact of control programs. People can easily become reinfected if water sources remain contaminated and risky eating habits continue. In short, while praziquantel is an important treatment, it is not a complete solution. Long-term control of opisthorchiasis requires combined efforts, including safe food practices, better sanitation, and health education."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "What are the key types of echinococcosis, and how do they differ?", "answer": "The three primary types are cystic echinococcosis (CE), alveolar echinococcosis (AE), and neotropical echinococcosis (NE). They are caused by different Echinococcus species, and differ on their geographical distribution, transmission cycles and clinical presentation. Echinococcus granulosus is the cause of CE. It has a worldwide distribution, and the highest prevalence is observed in pastoral communities. It is the most common cause of echinococcosis in humans in which typically forms slow-growing fluid-filled cysts in the liver or lungs, causing symptoms like abdominal pain or cough. E. multilocularis causes AE. It is only present in the northern hemisphere. It behaves aggressively, invading tissues like a malignant tumor, primarily in the liver and spreading to other organs, often leading to fatal liver failure if untreated. NE is quite rare and includes two subtypes: Echinococcus vogeli which causes polycystic growths mainly in the liver and Echinococcus oligarthra wich has only been identified in very few human cases. They have only been reported in rural areas of the tropics in Central and South America."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "Can echinococcosis be asymptomatic?", "answer": "Echinococcosis, especially CE, can remain without symptoms for years. Cysts grow often unnoticed in organs until they enlarge, rupture, or cause complications. AE and NE may also have latent phases, though AE’s usually progresses quickly. Since NE is so rare it is not well understood how long it can remain without symptoms."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "Who is most at risk of contracting echinococcosis?", "answer": "People at highest risk of CE include pastoral communities where livestock and dogs interact (dogs are the main definitive host), and those in areas with poor sanitation. Children are particularly vulnerable due to close contact with dogs and poor hygiene People at high risk of AE are people in contact with the definitive hosts (mainly wild carnivores, for example foxes, coyotes, wolves) such as hunters."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "How is echinococcosis transmitted to humans?", "answer": "Humans contract echinococcosis through accidental ingestion of Echinococcus eggs, shed in the faeces of infected definitive hosts—primarily dogs (for E. granulosus ) or foxes/coyotes (for E. multilocularis ). The Echinococcus eggs can be present on contaminated animals’ fur, soil, food, water, or other surfaces (e.g., unwashed vegetables, untreated water)."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "How is echinococcosis transmitted to animals?", "answer": "Definitive hosts (e.g., dogs, foxes, coyotes) become infected by consuming tissues such as contaminated offal of intermediate hosts harbouring larval cysts. The intermediate hosts are livestock (mainly sheep) for CE, and rodents for AE."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "How are dogs, cattle, sheep, and other domestic animals infected with Echinococcus?", "answer": "Dogs serve as the definitive host for E. granulosus , and wild canids are the main definitive hosts for E. multilocularis . The definitive hosts carry adult tapeworms in their intestines (which are very small, 1.5-7mm long) without showing symptoms. They shed parasite eggs in faeces. For CE, livestock like sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs act as intermediate hosts. For AE, rodents act as intermediate hosts. Intermediate hosts get infected by ingesting Echinococcus eggs shed by the definitive hosts, from contaminated environments, which form cysts in their organs—primarily the liver and lungs. Definitive hosts get infected by eating those cysts when for example contaminated livers are fed to dogs, or when foxes eat infected rodents. The cysts in livestock rarely cause clinical illness in animals, but infected organs (offal) are unsafe for consumption at slaughter, resulting in economic losses."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "Is echinococcosis contagious and can it be transmitted from humans to humans?", "answer": "Echinococcosis is not contagious between humans. The parasite requires an animal host, and human-to-human transmission is rare, except in cases like organ transplantation or accidental cyst fluid exposure during surgery."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "Why is echinococcosis treatment complex in humans?", "answer": "Treatment is complicated because cysts and the disease progress in differing ways depending on cyst type and location. For CE, options for clinical management include: (i) antiparasitic drug treatment; (ii) percutaneous treatment of CE cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique, standard catheterization or the modified catheterization technique; (iii) surgery; and (iv) the “watch and wait” approach. AE often requires surgery, followed by long term medication with albendazole to prevent recurrence. Even in complex cases, treatment can help manage the disease effectively, and ongoing medical care improves outcomes."}
{"topic": "/echinococcosis", "question": "How does the One Health approach contribute to the prevention and control of echinococcosis?", "answer": "The One Health approach integrates human, animal, and environmental strategies to control echinococcosis transmission. Key contributions include: Veterinary/livestock interventions: Regular deworming of dogs with praziquantel, controlling stray dog populations, banning raw offal feeding and proper disposal of infected offal, and stricter meat inspections reduce the risk of transmission. A very safe an effective sheep vaccine is also available to help break the parasite’s cycle. Public health education: Promoting hygiene in endemic regions and educating high-risk groups (herders, hunters) about safer practices. Environmental measures: such as improved sanitation and regulating wild canid populations, further limit spread. Lastly, Surveillance of human, animal, and wildlife infections helps target high-risk areas."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "Where is fascioliasis most commonly found?", "answer": "Animal fasciolosis (in animals there is a tendency to use the term fasciolosis instead of fascioliasis) is present in almost all countries, and it can be an important problem in livestock. However, human fascioliasis is only a problem in regions in which the disease is present in livestock, but additionally, the socioeconomic determinants necessary for human infection occur. Those are areas in which people eat aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, and livestock or human faeces contaminate water sources.  It is associated with poor sanitation and inadequate food hygiene. Some of the areas that have reported the highest prevalences of human fascioliasis are found in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Peru, and Egypt. Other areas that have reported problems are Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa, India, Laos, and China (1). It has been estimated that over 2.4 million people are affected worldwide (1)."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "How does climate change affect fascioliasis transmission?", "answer": "Warmer temperatures and increased rainfall can expand the habitats of the freshwater snail species that are the intermediate hosts, facilitating the spread of Fasciola . Flooding can also disseminate contaminated water to new areas, increasing infection risks."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "Is fascioliasis a neglected tropical disease?", "answer": "Yes. Fascioliasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) due to its disproportionate impact on impoverished, rural communities with limited access to healthcare and clean water. It is one of the four most common foodborne trematode infections, alongside Opisthorchiasis, Paragonimiasis, and Clonorchiasis. Fascioliasis was first included in the WHO report on NTDs in 2010."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "How do humans get infected with Fasciola?", "answer": "Humans become infected by consuming raw plants that have been irrigated or contaminated with Fasciola larvae through exposure to unsafe water sources. Once ingested, the larvae migrate through the liver and bile ducts, causing tissue damage and inflammation."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "Can fascioliasis spread directly from person to person?", "answer": "No. The parasite requires freshwater snails as intermediate hosts to complete its lifecycle. Humans and animals become infected only by ingesting contaminated water or plants."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "Why are rural communities at higher risk of fascioliasis?", "answer": "Rural communities are at higher risk due to reliance on untreated water sources, such as rivers and ponds that can be contaminated with livestock or human faeces, for drinking and irrigation. Also, many rural communities traditionally eat raw plants that grow or are irrigated with those waters. Poor sanitation and hygiene are one of the determinants of health associated with fascioliasis."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "What are the symptoms of fascioliasis?", "answer": "Early symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and liver enlargement. Chronic infection can lead to bile duct obstruction, jaundice, and liver fibrosis. Some individuals may remain asymptomatic despite infection."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "Why is fascioliasis often misdiagnosed?", "answer": "Fascioliasis symptoms mimic those of other liver and bile duct diseases, such as hepatitis and cholangitis. Diagnostic tools, including stool examinations for parasite eggs and serological tests, are not widely available in many endemic regions, complicating diagnosis"}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "What are the treatment options for fascioliasis?", "answer": "Triclabendazole is the first-line treatment, effective against both immature and adult flukes. In rare cases, surgery may be required to address complications such as bile duct obstruction."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-fascioliasis", "question": "What socioeconomic factors fuel fascioliasis transmission?", "answer": "Socioeconomic factors play a crucial role in the transmission of fascioliasis. Poverty, lack of access to clean water, and inadequate sanitation increase the risk of exposure to the parasite. Communities that traditionally eat raw plants that grow near or are irrigated with contaminated sources of water are at higher risk. Rural communities with limited healthcare access often struggle with early diagnosis and treatment, leading to prolonged infections and higher disease burden. Additionally, lower maternal education levels and reliance on livestock for income contribute to higher transmission rates. Children from low-income households are more frequently exposed to contaminated water sources and aquatic plants, increasing their risk of infection. Addressing these social determinants through improved sanitation, health education, and poverty reduction strategies is essential for controlling fascioliasis."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "What socioeconomic factors fuel clonorchiasis transmission?", "answer": "Poverty, the tradition to eat raw or undercooked freshwater fish, and inadequate sanitation in rural areas drive high infection rates. Limited healthcare access delays diagnosis, perpetuating cycles of contamination through untreated human waste in water systems."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "How does climate change impact clonorchiasis spread?", "answer": "Warmer temperatures and flooding can expand habitats for snails and fish that carry the parasite, increasing the chances of infection. Climate change may also affect food availability, leading some communities to fish in contaminated areas where infected fish are more common. This raises the risk of people catching and eating fish that carry the parasite."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "Why is clonorchiasis underdiagnosed in non-endemic countries?", "answer": "Migrants or travellers from endemic regions may carry asymptomatic infections. Doctors in non-endemic areas often lack awareness, and stool tests for parasite eggs are not routine unless specifically requested."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "Are pets or livestock at risk of spreading clonorchiasis?", "answer": "Yes. Dogs, cats, and pigs can act as reservoir hosts, shedding parasite eggs in their feces, which might contaminate water. This sustains the lifecycle, emphasizing the need for veterinary action in endemic regions."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "Can cooking utensils contaminated with raw fish spread clonorchiasis?", "answer": "No. The parasite requires specific snail and fish hosts to complete its lifecycle. However, cross-contamination of utensils may pose risks for other foodborne illnesses, highlighting the need for kitchen hygiene."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "Why are some communities resistant to changing raw fish-eating practices?", "answer": "Traditional dishes like koi pla (Thailand) or sashimi (Japan) are an important part of local culture and identity, making change difficult. However, eating raw fish can lead to infections like clonorchiasis. To reduce the risk without disrespecting traditions, education campaigns can promote cooking fish thoroughly as a safer alternative. Cooking is a practical solution in many communities where freezing fish may not be possible."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "Can clonorchiasis increase vulnerability to other liver diseases?", "answer": "Yes. Long-term clonorchiasis infection causes chronic inflammation and damage to the bile ducts, which can lead to serious liver problems. One of the most severe outcomes is cholangiocarcinoma, a deadly bile duct cancer. The parasite's presence in the bile ducts triggers continuous irritation and scarring, which over time increases the risk of cancer developing. People with chronic clonorchiasis are also more vulnerable to other liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or C, especially when combined with other factors like alcohol use."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "How does clonorchiasis affect children differently than adults?", "answer": "Children often experience malnutrition and stunted growth due to chronic infection. Early exposure increases lifetime bile duct cancer risk, as damage accumulates over decades."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "What is the treatment for clonorchiasis?", "answer": "Clonorchiasis is usually treated with a medicine called praziquantel, which kills the adult worms living in the bile ducts. Treatment can help stop the infection and reduce symptoms. However, it cannot undo the long-term damage to the liver and bile ducts caused by chronic infection. This is why preventing infection—by not eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish—is very important."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-clonorchiasis", "question": "How can clonorchiasis be prevented?", "answer": "The best way to prevent clonorchiasis is to avoid eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish. Cooking fish thoroughly until it is fully cooked kills the parasites. Improved sanitation is essential to prevent contamination with human feces of water sources where fish live. Where possible, community-based approaches like fish farming in clean water and public education campaigns about the risks of eating raw fish also help reduce infection rates."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "What are the differences between taeniasis and cysticercosis?", "answer": "Taeniasis and cysticercosis are both caused by Taenia species, but they are distinct conditions: There are different species of Taenia that can infect humans: T. solium , T. saginata , and T. asiatica . Only T. solium can cause taeniasis and cysticercosis in humans, while T. saginata and T. asiatica cause taeniasis but do not lead to cysticercosis. Taeniasis occurs when a person consumes undercooked pork containing cysticerci (larval cysts), leading to an adult tapeworm infection in the intestines. Symptoms are often mild or absent, though some individuals experience digestive issues. Cysticercosis occurs when a person ingests T. solium eggs, usually through the faecal-oral route due to poor hygiene practices such as improper handwashing after using the toilet or handling contaminated surfaces or ingesting contaminated food or water. The larvae hatch and form cysts in tissues, including muscles, skin, and the brain (neurocysticercosis), potentially causing severe neurological symptoms such as seizures. Taeniasis is mainly an infection in the digestive tract, while cysticercosis is a systemic infection affecting various organs."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "Where do the diseases occur?", "answer": "Reliable, detailed epidemiological data on geographical distribution of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in people and pigs is scarce, but can be estimated based on reported human and porcine cysticercosis cases and known risk factors like water and sanitation indicators, and data on pig production, population and geographic conditions. T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis mainly affects the health and livelihoods of subsistence farming communities in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces. But imported taeniasis can also lead to cases in the population of countries where T. solium is not considered a public health problem."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "Why do cysticercosis symptoms sometimes appear years after infection?", "answer": "Cysticercosis symptoms can take years to appear because the larvae of Taenia solium can remain dormant in the body for a long time. Initially, the immune system may not react strongly to them. However, when the larvae begin to degenerate or die, they trigger an immune response that causes inflammation. This can lead to symptoms such as seizures, headaches, or fluid buildup in the brain. In some cases, even calcified cysts that previously caused no symptoms can later provoke inflammation, potentially resulting in epilepsy or other neurological problems."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "Why do some people with tapeworm infections have no symptoms while others develop serious complications like cysticercosis?", "answer": "The difference lies in how a person becomes infected and which stage of the parasite is involved. Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by ingesting undercooked pork containing Taenia solium larvae (cysticerci). In most cases, taeniasis causes little to no symptoms. Cysticercosis , on the other hand, occurs when a person ingests T. solium eggs—often through contaminated food, water, or poor hygiene. Once inside the body, these eggs hatch into larvae, which can migrate to tissues such as muscles, skin, or the brain. When the larvae form cysts in the brain (neurocysticercosis), they can cause seizures and other neurological problems. The severity of cysticercosis depends on factors such as the number and location of cysts, the body's immune response, and whether the cysts are still growing, degenerating, or calcified over time."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "How does Taenia solium spread from person to person, and how can it be prevented?", "answer": "T. solium can spread directly between people. A person with an intestinal tapeworm releases T. solium eggs in their stool, which can contaminate food, water, or surfaces. If someone accidentally swallows these eggs, they can develop cysticercosis. Poor hygiene can also lead to self-infection if an infected person unknowingly ingests eggs from their own stool. To prevent the spread of T. solium : Wash hands properly with soap and clean water, especially after using the toilet and before handling food. Improve sanitation to prevent faecal contamination in the environment. Avoid eating raw or undercooked pork to reduce the risk of getting a tapeworm infection. Diagnose and treat tapeworm infections early to stop the spread of eggs to others."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "How do food preparation and cooking affect the risk of being infected with by Taenia solium?", "answer": "Good food preparation and cooking help prevent infections caused by Taenia solium , a parasite that can lead to both tapeworm infection and cysticercosis. People can get a tapeworm by eating raw or undercooked pork that has the parasite. Cooking pork well—until it reaches at least 80°C inside for at least 10 minutes or 70°C for at least 20 minutes—kills the parasite and makes the meat safe to eat (1) . Cysticercosis happens when someone swallows Taenia solium eggs, usually through food or water that has been contaminated with human faeces. This can happen if hands are not washed properly or if raw vegetables are not cleaned well. Washing hands, cleaning cooking surfaces, and rinsing fruits and vegetables with clean water are simple ways to reduce this risk. ---------------------------------- References Møller KS, Ngowi H, Magnussen P, Magne J, Kabululu M, Johansen MV.

{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "How do cultural and dietary practices contribute to taeniasis and cysticercosis transmission?", "answer": "Cultural food preferences, such as consuming raw or undercooked pork (e.g., larb in Thailand, chicharrón crudo in Latin America), significantly contribute to taeniasis transmission. In some communities, pig farming is closely integrated into household environments, leading to higher exposure to contaminated faeces. Religious and traditional beliefs can also influence treatment-seeking behaviour; in certain areas, people prefer traditional remedies over medical treatment, delaying diagnosis and increasing transmission."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "What are the economic and social impacts of Taenia solium infections in endemic regions?", "answer": "Cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis can lead to long-term health issues, including epilepsy and disability, which reduce a person’s ability to work and earn a living. Families may face high medical costs for diagnosis and treatment, especially in areas with limited healthcare access. Infected pigs are often unfit for sale or consumption, leading to financial losses for farmers. Additionally, stigma around epilepsy and neurological disorders can affect social relationships and quality of life. Investing in prevention, early treatment, and public awareness can help reduce these burdens."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "What role do pigs play in the Taenia solium life cycle, and how can pig farming practices help control transmission?", "answer": "Pigs act as an intermediate host for T. solium , becoming infected when they consume human faeces or food contaminated with tapeworm eggs. Infected pigs develop cysts in their muscles, which can infect humans if the meat is undercooked. Improving pig farming practices—such as ensuring pigs are not in contact with human faeces by keeping pigs in enclosed areas, providing safe feed, and ensuring veterinary inspections—can significantly reduce transmission risks."}
{"topic": "/taeniasis-and-cysticercosis", "question": "Why is early detection and treatment of taeniasis important in preventing cysticercosis?", "answer": "Early diagnosis and treatment of taeniasis help stop the spread of T. solium eggs, reducing the risk of cysticercosis in both the infected person and their community. Since taeniasis often has no symptoms, infected individuals may unknowingly spread the parasite."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "What is chikungunya?", "answer": "Chikungunya is a viral disease spread by mosquito bites, primarily from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (or tiger) mosquitoes , which mainly bite during daylight hours. It is caused by the chikungunya virus. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, rash, headache and severe fatigue. While most people recover after a week, joint pain can sometimes last for much longer."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "Where does chikungunya disease occur?", "answer": "Chikungunya is present in many parts of the world, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus (tiger) mosquitoes – the primary carriers of the virus – are found. The virus has also spread to new areas (occasionally causing outbreaks), such as Europe and North America, through infected travelers. Places in those new areas where temperatures are warm enough for mosquitoes to thrive are particularly vulnerable."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "How can I protect myself and my family from chikungunya?", "answer": "There is currently no treatment for chikungunya, so the best way to protect yourself and your family is through prevention. Avoiding mosquito bites is essential. Here are some effective ways to reduce your risk: apply mosquito repellant (containing DEET, IR3535 or picaridin) to exposed skin or clothing, according to label instructions; wear protective clothing, such as long sleeves and trousers, especially during the day when the mosquitoes that spread chikungunya are most active; sleep under mosquito nets, especially during the day; use mosquito screens on doors and windows or keep them closed, to prevent mosquitoes from entering the room; and remove standing water from items like tyres, buckets and flowerpots – these are common breeding grounds for mosquitoes."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "What are the symptoms of chikungunya?", "answer": "Symptoms of chikungunya typically appear 4 to 8 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms may include: sudden high fever severe joint pain muscle pain headache skin rash fatigue or general weakness occasionally, nausea. Most people begin to feel better within a week. However, some symptoms, like joint pain, sometimes last for several weeks or even months. A small minority of patients may still feel very tired even after two years."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "Who is most at risk?", "answer": "While chikungunya can affect people of all ages, certain groups are more likely to experience severe symptoms, or recover more slowly than others. These include: older adults, particularly those over 65 years; infants and young children; pregnant women; and people suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease or other health conditions. Anyone experiencing symptoms of chikungunya should seek medical care as soon as possible, especially if they belong to a high-risk group."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "What is the treatment for chikungunya?", "answer": "Currently, there are no specific medicines for chikungunya. Instead, care focuses on relieving symptoms: treat fever and joint pain with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or metamizole (if available); avoid aspirin, ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until dengue infection has been ruled out, as they can increase the risk of bleeding in dengue patients; and stay well hydrated and get plenty of rest to support recovery. If symptoms persist for more than a few days or worsen, it is important to seek medical care."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "Can I get chikungunya more than once?", "answer": "Based on current scientific evidence, it is unlikely that people who have been infected with chikungunya will get reinfected again. Research is still ongoing. Some people develop chronic chikungunya infection, which usually manifests as chronic joint pain that lasts for months and even years. However, this does not mean that the person has been infected more than once."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "Is there a vaccine for chikungunya?", "answer": "As of now, two single-dose chikungunya vaccines (IXCHIQ and VIMKUNYA) have been approved by regulatory agencies in several countries and regions, including by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Generally, these vaccines are recommended in those jurisdictions for people at risk of severe disease and those travelling to areas with known chikungunya transmission. However, the vaccines are not yet widely available or in widespread use globally. Currently, WHO has not issued recommendations for the use of these vaccines. WHO and its external expert advisors (the Strategic Advisory Group Experts on immunization) are still reviewing vaccine clinical trial data to inform future guidance. Additionally, neither vaccine has received WHO prequalification or been included on the WHO Emergency Use Listing at this time."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "How is chikungunya diagnosed?", "answer": "Diagnosing chikungunya based on symptoms alone can be difficult, because the symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses such as dengue or Zika. To confirm infection, laboratory testing is required. During the first week of illness, when symptoms first appear, chikungunya can be diagnosed by detecting the virus in a blood sample, using molecular or virus isolation tests. After the first week, tests can detect antibodies (the body’s immune response) to the virus. These tests are usually done 1 to 2 weeks apart to confirm a recent or past infection. Accurate diagnosis is important, especially in areas where similar viruses are circulating."}
{"topic": "/chikungunya", "question": "What can be done to prevent or reduce the spread of chikungunya?", "answer": "Chikungunya spreads through the bite of infected mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , which are most active during the day. The best way to prevent or reduce its spread is to prevent mosquito bites, through mosquito control and personal protection. It is recommended that people living in or visiting areas where chikungunya is spreading: wear long clothing that minimizes skin exposure to mosquitoes, especially during the day; apply mosquito repellants containing DEET, IR3535 or picaridin to exposed skin or clothing according to product label instructions; sleep under mosquito nets (ideally insecticide-treated nets), especially when sleeping during the day and to protect people at high-risk (such as sick patients, older people and young children) from mosquito bites; and use screens in windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from entering homes. It is important to note that persons with suspected or confirmed chikungunya infection should also take these measures and avoid mosquito bites during the first week of illness, as mosquitoes that bite them could become infected and potentially spread the virus to others. To help stop the spread of chikungunya virus, it is important to control the mosquitoes that carry the virus and destroy their breeding places. These mosquitoes usually lay eggs in standing water found in everyday containers like tyres, open water reservoirs, tanks, and empty cans around the home. To reduce mosquito breeding: empty and clean water containers at least once a week keep water reservoirs and containers tightly covered. dispose of garbage regularly and properly to avoid water collecting. During outbreaks, health authorities may take extra steps such as spraying insecticides in affected areas (called mosquito fogging) and applying insecticide on indoor surfaces where mosquitoes usually land (indoor residual spraying) to kill adult mosquitoes. Additionally, special products can be added to water to kill the mosquito larvae before they grow into adults. Ultimately, preventing chikungunya requires the effort of the whole community. When everyone comes together to reduce mosquito breeding sites and protect themselves against bites, the risk of transmission drops significantly, and outbreaks can be prevented."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "How does exposure to radioactive iodine occur?", "answer": "During a nuclear accident, radioactive iodine may be released to the environment in a plume or cloud and subsequently contaminate soil, surfaces, food and water. It may settle on an individual’s skin and clothing, resulting in external exposure to radiation. Radioactive iodine deposited on skin can be removed by washing with warm water and soap. If radioactive iodine is inhaled (e.g., from a radioactive cloud) or ingested (e.g., through contaminated food, milk or water), it results in internal exposure to radiation. When radioactive iodine enters the body, it accumulates in the thyroid gland in the same way non-radioactive stable iodine would due to the natural biokinetic pathway of iodine in the human body."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "What are the health risks of exposure to radioactive iodine?", "answer": "Iodine is a necessary element of the human diet and is used by the thyroid gland to produce hormones that regulate the body’s metabolism. During a nuclear accident, the thyroid gland is at particular risk as it does not differentiate between stable (non-radioactive) and radioactive iodine. Uptake of radioactive iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children. The younger the age at exposure, the higher the risk of developing thyroid cancer later in life. In children of Chernobyl, exposed to radioactive iodine with contaminated milk and food, the increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was first detected 4 to 5 years after the time of exposure in 1986."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "How can the risk of exposure to radioactive iodine be reduced?", "answer": "The thyroid gland can be protected from radioactive iodine by saturating it with stable (non-radioactive) iodine . This protective measure known as iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) consists of administering potassium iodide (KI) (1) tablets before or at the beginning of exposure to radioactive iodine. When taken at the appropriate dosage and within the correct time interval around exposure to radioactive iodine, KI saturates the thyroid gland with stable (non-radioactive) iodine. As a result, radioactive iodine will not be taken up and stored by the thyroid gland. Any iodine which exceeds the thyroid’s needs for production of thyroid hormones (either non-radioactive or radioactive) will be excreted through the urine within days."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "Is KI a radiation antidote?", "answer": "No. KI is not an antidote for radiation exposure. It only protects the thyroid gland and only if there is a risk of internal exposure to radioactive iodine (e.g., a nuclear power plant accident). Please note that KI: does not protect against any other radioactive substances that may be released in the environment as a result of a nuclear accident (2) ; does not protect against external radiation, e.g., from radioactivity deposited on the ground, on surfaces or on foods; and does not prevent radioactive iodine from entering the body, but it does prevent its accumulation in the thyroid."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "Is there enough iodine in table salt and a normal diet?", "answer": "Stable (non-radioactive) iodine is an essential nutrient that humans need in very small quantities for the thyroid gland to function properly. This gland gathers iodine to produce thyroid hormones, which are important for metabolism in all age groups. Thyroid hormones are also crucial for brain maturation and the development in the fetus and young child from the 15th week of gestation to 3 years of age. When iodine intake falls below certain levels, the thyroid is no longer able to produce hormones in sufficient amounts, which is a threat to health. In some areas where foods and diet are deficient in iodine, intake is supplemented using iodized table salt. However, iodized table salt used in day-to-day eating and cooking does not contain sufficient concentrations of iodine to block the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid. During nuclear emergencies, iodized table salt should not be used as a substitute for KI since it will not provide protection against radioactive iodine, and because eating excessive amounts of iodized salt will itself pose a significant health hazard."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "When and how should I take KI?", "answer": "KI should not be taken as a generic protective measure in anticipation of an event. KI tablets should be taken only when explicitly instructed to do so by public health authorities. The effectiveness of KI for thyroid blocking depends on its timely administration. The optimal period of administration of stable iodine is less than 24 hours prior to, and up to 2 hours after, the expected onset of exposure. It would still be reasonable to take KI up to 8 hours after the exposure. However, taking it later than 24 hours after exposure will offer no protection. Instructions from public health authorities about how KI must be taken should be followed carefully; the correct dose of KI will differ according to age (see the package insert for detailed dosage explanation). A single dose of KI usually offers adequate protection for 24 hours. In the event of prolonged or repeated exposure, unavoidable ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water, and where evacuation is not feasible, repeated administration of stable iodine may be necessary. Under such circumstances, neonates (< 1 month of age), pregnant or breastfeeding women, and persons older than 60 years should not be given repeated doses of KI. Other protective actions should be considered for these particular groups on a case-by-case basis and under medical advice."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "How is KI distributed?", "answer": "Nuclear emergency preparedness usually includes plans to ensure that KI tablets are readily accessible. This can mean they are pre-distributed to strategic sites such as households, schools, hospitals, pharmacies, fire and police stations, and evacuation and civil defence centres. When the implementation of iodine thyroid blocking with KI is warranted, public health authorities should define the geographic area in which the population should take KI tablets, as well as when, how and by whom. These instructions may be given through the radio, TV, internet, loudspeakers and other available channels and should be carefully followed. National authorities decide on the methods of pre-positioning and pre-distribution of KI pills in their countries. Voluntary purchase of iodine tablets by the general public is allowed in many countries; however, it should not be taken until instructed by authorities. In addition, iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) should not be implemented as stand-alone protective action but jointly with other measures such as sheltering, evacuation, and stopping the consumption of contaminated food and drinking water, if needed."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "Can KI be given to children?", "answer": "Yes, when instructed by public health authorities. The risk of thyroid cancer in children following exposure to radioactive iodine is higher than in adults; younger age groups are at highest risk. As a result, the protection of children must be considered a priority when public health authorities distribute and administer KI to individuals. It should be given to all children at the recommended dosage. The only exceptions are children who have an absolute contraindication (see below on contraindications). Newborn babies (< 1 month of age) should only ever take a single dose of KI. These babies should have their thyroid hormone levels monitored after the administration of KI; a consultation with a paediatrician within the first week after the administration of KI is advisable. As thyroid function in newborn babies is critical for brain development, babies should have their thyroid hormone levels monitored after the administration of KI."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "Can pregnant and breastfeeding women take KI tablets?", "answer": "Yes, when instructed by public health authorities and following the recommended dosage for adults. During pregnancy, the mother's thyroid gland is metabolically more active than in non-pregnant women, and the amount of radioactive iodine that will be taken up by the thyroid increases in comparison with other adults. The fetal thyroid gland may be exposed to radioactive iodine through the placenta, but it will also be protected by the KI taken by the mother. Like the rest of the population, pregnant women should take KI tablets only when instructed so by the authorities. By doing so, they will protect their own thyroid as well as that of their unborn child. Once the nuclear emergency is over, pregnant women should inform their doctor so this information can be added to their medical records and thyroid function of the newborn baby can be evaluated. Pregnant women should usually take only a single dose of KI. Breastfeeding women also should take KI tablets only when instructed by public health authorities. The amount of KI that a breastfeeding woman will provide to an infant through breast milk is not enough to protect the thyroid of an infant exposed to radioactive iodine. Therefore, in addition to the KI tablet taken by a woman who is breastfeeding, the baby should also be given KI at the recommended, age-specific dosage (3) . Under these conditions, breastfeeding can continue. Unless otherwise instructed, breastfeeding women and newborn babies should each take only a single dose of KI."}
{"topic": "/use-of-potassium-iodine-for-thyroid-protection-during-nuclear-or-radiological-emergencies", "question": "Are there adverse effects of KI?", "answer": "When used as instructed by public health authorities, the overall benefits of thyroid blocking with KI during a nuclear emergency will outweigh the risks of side effects in all age groups. When the appropriate dosage is followed, side effects from KI are rare in children and young adults. However, they may include mild allergic reactions, skin rash and gastrointestinal upset. The risk of side effects from KI increases with age, while the risk of radiation induced thyroid cancer in individuals over 40 years old is low. For this reason, thyroid blocking with KI is not generally indicated in adults over 40 years of age (with an exception for emergency response personnel). Rare adverse effects of KI on thyroid function may occur in individuals with pre-existing thyroid disorders, which are more common in older adults and the elderly than in children or young adults. Side effects are more likely in individuals who receive a dosage higher than recommended, or who receive repeated doses of KI. The frequency of these thyroid disorders varies between countries, so national authorities may adopt different approaches when determining the appropriate age groups and dosing for administration of KI. There are few clinical conditions in which the administration of KI is absolutely contraindicated."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "What is the WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage?", "answer": "Based on country-reported data, the annual WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC) provide the world’s largest dataset on immunization coverage trends for 16 vaccines/antigens/doses across 195 WHO and UNICEF Member States. For 2024, 191 countries reported immunization data and 189 coverage data, representing 96% of the global 2024 cohort; for non-reporting countries the 2023 WUENIC estimated coverage was used. The dataset provides a critical assessment of how well we are doing in reaching every child with life-saving vaccines, helping to spotlight where progress is lacking, including where reversals in immunization coverage have happened, and where there are areas of success."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "What is the methodology behind the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage?", "answer": "Each year WHO and UNICEF generate estimates of national immunization coverage that are based on coverage data officially reported to the organizations by Member States as well as data reported in the published and grey literature, for example coverage surveys. Whenever possible we have consulted with local experts - primarily national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) managers and regional office staff - for additional information regarding the performance of specific immunization programmes. Based on the data available, consideration of potential biases, and contributions from local experts we have attempted to estimate the most likely level of immunization coverage. The methodology can be accessed here ."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "How long have the WUENIC estimates been produced?", "answer": "The WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage began to be produced in 1999 and initially and covered just five vaccines. In 2001, revisions were made to the methodology, the process was rolled-out across countries and the first WUENIC estimates were published.  Since then, the methodology has been improved, the estimates have been produced every year and vaccination coverage estimates are now made for 195 countries and 16 vaccines/antigens/doses."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "What are the vaccination data sources that are used to create the WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage estimates?", "answer": "There are various data sources: Administrative coverage : Reported by national authorities through the WHO and UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on immunization (JRF) mechanism. This is based on aggregated data from administrative reports from health service providers on the number of children vaccinated during a given period (numerator data), usually a year, and reported target population data (denominator data); Official coverage: Estimated coverage reported by national authorities through the JRF that reflects their assessment of most likely coverage based on any combination of administrative coverage, survey-based estimates, or other data sources or adjustments. Approaches to determining official coverage may vary from country to country; Survey coverage : Based on estimated population-based survey coverage (such as Vaccination Coverage Surveys, Demographic and Health and UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys), usually among children aged 12-23 months or 24-35 months. Inclusion of survey data is done after a review of the survey methods and results against a minimum set of quality and age-disaggregation criteria. The coverage data used is based on the combination of vaccination history from documented evidence, usually from vaccination cards, or recall from the caregiver following probing questions. Results from the survey are considered for the corresponding birth cohort according to the data collection period and the birth year of most children. For example, a survey conducted in October 2022 will be assigned to 2021 for the 12–23-month cohort; Other sources: Use of other evaluations published in literature, contextual information, such as vaccine shortages, and health worker strikes, results from data quality analyses, and information from country experts with local knowledge."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "Do these estimates have limitations? If so, what are they?", "answer": "Yes, the WUENIC estimates have limitations, mainly linked to the availability and quality of the underlying empirical data. For example: The availability, quality and timeliness of empirical      data informing the estimates directly influences their accuracy; Administrative coverage is affected by the completeness      and accuracy of the reporting of vaccinated children and the estimation of      the target population. Recording and aggregation of children vaccinated      may contain errors. The estimates of target population depend on the      availability of recent quality censuses and, in some countries, the      completeness and timeliness of birth registration; Surveys can be affected by multiple biases. Notably,      some areas of difficult access or vulnerable populations may not be      included in surveys. Also, where documented evidence of vaccination is not      available, survey may have to rely on caregiver recall of the vaccines      received by their child, which is known to be less reliable than vaccines      documented in home-based records (cards)."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "Why are the WUENIC estimates of national immunization coverage estimates important?", "answer": "A historical representation of immunization coverage can help to assess trends in immunization program performance, to better establish the relationship between immunization service delivery and disease occurrence, and to provide a framework for setting future goals for immunization programmes. WUENIC facilitates having a critical assessment of how well we are doing in reaching every child with life-saving vaccines and meeting goals, such as those set by the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030). By providing data on countries where immunization coverage has stagnated or regressed, WUENIC makes it easier for the immunization community to conduct further research and work together in addressing bottlenecks to reach universal coverage. In addition, examination of the factors contributing to increases in coverage in specific contexts can provide lessons for other countries as they scale up and improve their own immunization programmes."}
{"topic": "/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage", "question": "What are the estimates used for?", "answer": "The WHO/UNICEF estimates are used to monitor and compare the performance of immunization programs at the national, regional, and international levels in a standardized way. The WUENIC data provides information to countries in terms of coverage patterns and trends to help Ministries of Health continue to strengthen immunization service delivery outcomes and take corrective action where un or under-immunized communities persist. These estimates should be used alongside the accompanying text that provides additional information regarding each estimate. The dataset is instrumental to monitoring progress towards global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030). Since 2018, WUENIC has been used as the official source to monitor compliance with Sustainable Development Goal 3.b.1. These estimates are also used as an information resource by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and other agencies that support immunization in selected countries.

{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "What is social connection?", "answer": "Social connection describes how people relate to and interact with each other. It has three dimensions: structure (the number and types of relationships and roles, and how often and how long people interact); function (the type and amount of support exchanged); and quality (whether interactions are positive – loving, satisfying – or negative – strained, conflictual, or violent)."}
{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "What is social isolation?", "answer": "Social isolation, a form of social disconnection, is the objective state of having too few roles, relationships, and interactions with others. It can be easily counted and measured."}
{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "What is loneliness?", "answer": "Loneliness, another form of social disconnection, is a subjective, distressing feeling that arises when there is a gap between the social connections one has and those one wants or needs."}
{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "How widespread is the issue?", "answer": "The best data available relates to loneliness, a form of social disconnection. New estimates from the report of the WHO commission on social connection show it is a widespread global issue: Approximately 1 in 6 people globally (15.8%) report feeling lonely. Loneliness affects all regions and age groups, but some groups are more affected than others: Young people, especially adolescents, report the highest rates – 21% say they are lonely. Rates generally decrease with age. Loneliness is more common in lower-income countries: 24.3% of people in low-income countries report feeling lonely compared to 11% in high-income countries. Rates are similar for males and females."}
{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "What is driving loneliness and social isolation?", "answer": "Loneliness and social isolation can be driven by many factors including: Poor physical or mental health such as chronic illness, anxiety, depression. Marginalization (e.g., people with disabilities, LGBTIQ+ individuals, migrants, refugees). Low levels of education and income. Living alone or without a partner. Major life changes such as moving, job loss, relationship breakups, retirement or bereavement. Weak community resources such as lack of transport, parks, or leisure spaces. Excessive or harmful use of digital media, especially among younger people."}
{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "What are the impacts?", "answer": "The impacts of social disconnection are serious and widespread yet often overlooked. New WHO      estimates show loneliness causes 871 000 deaths each year. Social isolation and loneliness harm physical health (e.g., higher risk of heart      disease and type 2 diabetes) and mental health (e.g., increased depression      and anxiety). They also affect education and work: Students who feel connected perform better in school. Lonely people may struggle at work, earn less, and face job instability. Communities and economies suffer too: Strong social ties make communities safer and more resilient. At the national level, loneliness costs billions in lost productivity and       health care."}
{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "What solutions look promising?", "answer": "Promising strategies to reduce loneliness and isolation include: Advocacy and campaigns, which raise awareness, shift social      norms, and build networks to coordinate actions across societies. These efforts      can help drive change at national and community levels. Policies, which integrate social connection into government priorities,      systems and funding. They can help coordinate action across sectors,      support research and ensure proven interventions reach those most in need. Community-based strategies, which improve “social      infrastructure” such as parks, libraries, public transport, while also      supporting local groups and services that bring people together. Individual and relationship strategies, which offer psychological      therapies such as social skills training and therapies (like cognitive      behavioural therapy) to help people build and maintain connections."}

{"topic": "/social-connection", "question": "Why has the issue of social connection become so prominent?", "answer": "Key reasons include: Growing scientific evidence shows that a lack of social      connection can significantly harm health and is linked to higher mortality      rates. The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions highlighted the      importance of social connection to health and wellbeing. The growing concerns about the impact of social media on mental      health and relationships. More local and national initiatives, particularly in      high-income countries, are being implemented to address loneliness and      promote social connection."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "Why did WHO’s Member States decide to create an agreement for pandemic preparedness and response?", "answer": "In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular the inequities witnessed in pandemic response, WHO’s 194 Member States decided to draft and negotiate an agreement, or other international instrument, to address pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. This was driven by the need to ensure communities, governments, and all sectors of society – within countries and globally – are better prepared and protected, to prevent and respond more equitably to future pandemics. The great loss of human life, disruption to households and societies at large, and impact on development are among the factors cited by governments to support the need for lasting action to prevent a repeat of such crises. At the heart of the agreement is the need to ensure equity in access to the tools needed to prevent and prepare for pandemics (including technologies like vaccines, personal protective equipment, information and expertise) and access to health care for all people."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "Why are such international agreements and instruments needed in global public health?", "answer": "WHO Member States have adopted two other global legally binding agreements to protect and promote people’s health, pursuant to the provisions of the WHO Constitution itself: the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and the International Health Regulations (2005). WHO Member States develop and adopt such agreements to, among other things, increase collaboration and coordinated action in multiple areas that impact on the health and well-being of people in communities, countries and globally. These international instruments represent a commitment by countries to address the health needs of their citizens, advance their health status, and strengthen the socio-economic status of their communities."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "What was the process to negotiate and adopt the Pandemic Agreement?", "answer": "The process to negotiate the international agreement for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response was launched by the World Health Assembly – WHO’s highest decision-making body – through a special session held in December 2021 , during the COVID-19 pandemic. Article 19 of the WHO Constitution gives WHO’s Member States the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on any matter within WHO’s competence. The first instrument established under Article 19 was the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , which has made a significant and rapid contribution to protecting people from the harm caused by tobacco, since its entry into force in 2005. WHO Member States established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) to guide the Pandemic Agreement negotiation process. The INB held its first meeting on 24 February 2022. Thereafter, the INB process involved 13 formal rounds of meetings, nine of which were extended. Member States also held many informal and intersessional discussions on various aspects of the draft agreement and the negotiation process. The INB was mandated to submit its final outcome to the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in May 2024. On 1 June 2024, recognizing that the INB had achieved progress and reached initial agreement on many provisions of the proposed WHO Pandemic Agreement, but that further work needed to be done to complete remaining elements, the Health Assembly decided to extend the INB’s mandate to finish its work as soon as possible, and submit its outcome for consideration by the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2025, or earlier by a special session of the World Health Assembly if possible in 2024. In the early hours of 16 April 2025, WHO Member States reached consensus on the proposed text of the WHO Pandemic Agreement, to be submitted for consideration and adoption by the Seventy-eight World Health Assembly. The closing session on 16 April can be watched here . After a more than three-year process led by WHO’s Member States, the INB formally concluded its work with the presentation of the proposed WHO Pandemic Agreement for consideration and adoption by the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly, which considered the draft text in Committee A on 19 May 2025 and adopted the instrument in Plenary on 20 May 2025 ."}

The IGWG was also tasked with facilitating, as necessary, activities related to the adoption of the PABS Annex and the opening for signature, ratification, acceptance, approval, accession or formal confirmation of the WHO Pandemic Agreement following the adoption of the Annex by the 79th World Health Assembly. The first organizational meeting of the IGWG will be held 9-10 July 2025."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "When will the Pandemic Agreement process be concluded and the treaty open for signature?", "answer": "In accordance with Article 31 of the WHO Pandemic Agreement, it shall be open for signature by Member States after the World Health Assembly adopts the PABS Annex, at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, and thereafter at United Nations Headquarters in New York, on dates to be determined by the World Health Assembly."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "What is the role of the WHO Secretariat in the Pandemic Agreement process?", "answer": "In December 2021, WHO’s Member States requested the WHO Director-General to convene the meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) and support its work, including by facilitating the participation of other United Nations system bodies, non-state actors, and other relevant stakeholders in the process to the extent decided by the 194 Member States forming part of the negotiations. WHO acted only as the Secretariat to the INB process, which was established by WHO’s Member States, who organized and led the drafting, discussion and negotiation process. In this sense, the WHO Secretariat’s role was to support countries – its Member States – as they negotiated and agreed the new international instrument. The WHO Secretariat did not determine the contents of the agreement, which was negotiated and agreed by WHO Member States."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "Who else was involved in the process to develop the WHO Pandemic Agreement?", "answer": "The process for developing the WHO Pandemic Agreement was led by a Bureau comprising six members (two co-chairs and four vice-chairs) representing each of WHO’s six regions who were selected and appointed by WHO’s Member States. The Bureau was supported by the WHO Secretariat and, through its guiding of the INB process, provided extensive opportunities for engagement with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including other United Nations system bodies, as well as non-State actors in official relations with WHO, to facilitate robust and inclusive participation in the proceedings. Throughout its three years of work, the INB sought inputs from relevant stakeholders , including through public hearings and other forms of consultation. The INB process allowed various constituencies to be actively engaged through: written and oral inputs from Member States and relevant stakeholders on the successive iterations of the work, including the identification of the substantive elements, the Working Draft, the Conceptual Zero Draft, the Zero Draft, and subsequent drafts leading to the proposal that was agreed by the INB during the resumed session of its thirteenth meeting; regional consultations; informal, focused consultations and interactive dialogues on selected key issues, including with experts; public hearings for interested parties and stakeholders to express their views; and regular briefings and consultations at global level."}

{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "What can the WHO Pandemic Agreement do to strengthen global pandemic prevention, preparedness and response?", "answer": "The WHO Pandemic Agreement represents a global commitment by WHO countries to work together, as an international community of sovereign nations, to prevent, prepare for, and equitably respond to pandemics so that individuals, communities, countries do not witness a repeat of what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, the Agreement establishes principles, priorities and targets for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, with the aim to: build resilience to pandemics; support prevention, detection, and responses to outbreaks with pandemic potential; ensure equitable access to pandemic countermeasures; and support global coordination through a stronger and more accountable WHO. The Pandemic Agreement complements other initiatives, actions and measures aimed at making the world safer from pandemics; this includes the International Health Regulations, and global systems and institutions working to equitably share health technologies, information and expertise. The Agreement took the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and used them to build back better. Equity is a key driver, principle and outcome within the new Agreement. The Agreement promotes political commitment at the highest level, through ensuring an all-of-government and whole-of-society approach within countries, and sustained and sufficient political and financial investment within and among countries."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "What gaps does the WHO Pandemic Agreement address?", "answer": "Among other things, the Agreement addresses gaps, weaknesses and inequities in key areas that were witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic including: prevention, preparedness and response arrangements; coordinated funding for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response; and mechanisms to increase equitable access to pandemic-related health products including vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Specific proposals on these matters and many others can be found in the text of the Agreement, as adopted by the World Health Assembly in resolution WHA78.1 ."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "How will the Agreement relate to the International Health Regulations (IHR)?", "answer": "The International Health Regulations (2005) (the “IHR”) is a key international instrument on international health, rooted in the WHO Constitution. The IHR was established to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The WHO Pandemic Agreement is designed to be coherent with, and complement, the IHR. The Health Assembly Special Session decision SSA2(5) of 2021, establishing the INB, noted the “need for coherence and complementarity between the process of developing the new instrument and the ongoing work […] regard to implementation and strengthening of the IHR (2005)”. In May 2022, the World Health Assembly agreed to start a process to consider “targeted” amendments to the IHR. This work was led by a dedicated Member-State led working group process (the Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005)). The Working Group held its first meeting on 14–15 November 2022 and ended its work on 24 May 2024. A Drafting Group established by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly concluded the work initiated by the Working Group, after Member States agreed a package of amendments to the IHR. Through decision WHA75(9) (2022) , the World Health Assembly requested the above-mentioned Working Group “to coordinate with the process of the [INB], by means that include regular coordination between the two respective Bureaux and alignment of meeting schedules and workplans, as both the International Health Regulations (2005) and the new instrument are expected to play central roles in pandemic prevention, preparedness and response in the future.” Recognizing how closely linked the two processes are, at WHA77 it was decided to create a single drafting group to take the two processes forward. That drafting group completed its work on the amendments to the IHR and recommended extension of the mandate of the INB process for taking forward the negotiations on the pandemic agreement. The Coordinating Financial Mechanism, which has already been established under the International Health Regulations (2005), will also be used to support implementation of the WHO Pandemic Agreement. This will include strengthening and expanding capacities for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and helping make needed surge financing available, particularly in developing countries. A proposal will be developed, through the IGWG, to operationalize the Mechanism to support implementation of the Pandemic Agreement and IHR (2005)."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "A focus of the  Pandemic Agreement  is on “pandemics”; is that term internationally defined, and how do “pandemics” fit with the International Health Regulations (IHR)?", "answer": "The amendments to the International Health Regulations , agreed by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly on 1 June 2024, include the definition of a Pandemic Emergency, which represents the new highest level of alarm contained within the IHR and available for use by the WHO Director-General. The Pandemic Emergency definition builds on the existing mechanisms of the IHR, including the determination of public health emergency of international concern. A Pandemic Emergency aims to trigger a more effective international collaboration in response to events that are at risk of becoming, or have become, a pandemic. Each and all of the six following criteria must be met for an “event” (which, according to the IHR, means a manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease) to be determined a “Pandemic Emergency”. These are: it must be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). A PHEIC means an extraordinary event which is determined (i) to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease; and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response; being of communicable disease nature; having, or at risk of having, wide demographical spread. exceeding, or is at high risk of exceeding, the capacity of health systems; causing, or is at high risk of causing, substantial social and/or economic disruption etc.; and requires rapid, equitable and enhanced coordinated international action etc."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "How much authority does the Pandemic Agreement have over signatory countries? Will the Pandemic Agreement take sovereignty away from signatory countries?", "answer": "None and no. The WHO Pandemic Agreement reaffirms the principle of sovereignty of States Parties in addressing public health matters, and that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the general principles of international law, the sovereign right to legislate and to implement legislation in pursuance of their health policies. Article 22, paragraph 2, of the Pandemic Agreement goes onto say that \"Nothing in the WHO Pandemic Agreement shall be interpreted as providing the Secretariat of the World Health Organization, including the Director-General of the World Health Organization, any authority to direct, order, alter or otherwise prescribe the national and/or domestic law, as appropriate, or policies of any Party, or to mandate or otherwise impose any requirements that Parties take specific actions, such as ban or accept travellers, impose vaccination mandates or therapeutic or diagnostic measures or implement lockdowns.” A guiding principle, set out in Article 3 of the WHO Pandemic Agreement is the “full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons.” As with all international instruments, the WHO Pandemic Agreement was determined by sovereign governments for themselves. The agreement reaffirms “the principle of the sovereignty of States in addressing public health matters”."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "Is the WHO Pandemic Agreement open to all countries to join or participate in?", "answer": "Yes. The WHO Pandemic Agreement is open to the participation of all countries, who would be able to participate if they so wished. In line with the example provided by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the Accord is also open to regional economic integration organizations."}
{"topic": "/pandemic-prevention--preparedness-and-response-accord", "question": "What could happen if countries that join or participate in the WHO Pandemic Agreement do not meet their obligations?", "answer": "It is up to WHO Member States to decide on compliance mechanisms. It is a general principle of international law that once an international law instrument is in force, it is binding on the parties to it, and that parties to it undertake to implement it in good faith."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "What is respiratory syncytial virus?", "answer": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that causes symptoms similar to the common cold, including a runny nose, cough and fever. RSV can cause more severe illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis. It is particularly dangerous for infants, young children, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems or serious underlying health conditions. Each year, RSV causes an estimated 33 million lung infections in children under 5 globally, leading to 3.6 million hospital stays and more than 100 000 deaths. About half of RSV deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The vast majority of paediatric RSV deaths (97%) occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care, such as oxygen or hydration. Nearly all children will experience at least one RSV infection by their second year of life."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "Can RSV in babies be prevented by immunization?", "answer": "Currently, there are two types of RSV immunization products recommended by WHO: maternal vaccine (RSVpreF), given to pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy (from 28 weeks gestation in most places) to protect infants against RSV by transferring antibodies from the mother to the baby through the placenta before birth; and monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab), given to infants right after birth or before the start of the RSV season to provide passive immunity against RSV. Given the global burden of severe RSV disease among infants, WHO recommends that all countries introduce immunization products for the prevention of severe RSV disease in this population. WHO recommends the use of either the maternal RSV vaccine or the monoclonal antibody, but not both, for the same mother-infant pair, except for special cases."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "Who should get immunized against RSV?", "answer": "Pregnant women should receive vaccination to protect their infants, or infants should receive monoclonal antibodies. Some countries are using RSV vaccines for older adults. WHO will evaluate RSV vaccines for older adults for potential future policy recommendations in the coming years."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "What is the maternal RSV vaccine (RSVpreF)?", "answer": "As of January 2025, one RSV vaccine is available for use during pregnancy: RSVpreF. RSVpreF is administered during pregnancy in the third trimester to protect infants against RSV by transferring antibodies from the mother to the fetus through the placenta before birth. Pregnant individuals should receive the vaccine more than two weeks before delivery to ensure adequate transfer of antibodies to protect the baby. However, even when administered in the weeks before delivery, transfer of lower amounts of antibodies is still likely to provide some protection. The vaccine may be given during routine antenatal care, including at one of the 5 WHO-recommended antenatal care contacts in the third trimester or any additional medical visits or consultations. RSVpreF has also been approved for use in several countries for: adults aged 60 and older adults aged 18–59 who have a higher risk of getting very sick from RSV."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "What is the monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab)?", "answer": "Nirsevimab is a one-time injection of monoclonal antibody given to infants after birth to help protect them against severe RSV. Nirsevimab starts protecting babies against RSV within a week of administration and lasts for at least 5 months, which can cover the entire RSV season in countries with RSV seasonality. In countries that administer the product year-round, WHO recommends that infants receive a single dose at birth or at the earliest opportunity thereafter. For countries that administer the product seasonally, a single dose is recommended for infants beginning shortly before the start of the RSV season, as well as at birth or the earliest opportunity thereafter. The greatest impact in preventing severe RSV disease will be achieved by administering monoclonal antibodies to infants under 6 months of age. However, there is still a potential benefit among infants up to 12 months of age."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "How effective are RSV immunization products?", "answer": "Both the maternal RSV vaccine and monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab) have shown high efficacy in preventing severe RSV disease. While neither offers complete immunity, both significantly reduce the risk of serious illness in infants. A large international study found that the maternal RSV vaccine (RSVpreF) reduced severe RSV illness requiring medical care by 82% in the first 3 months and by 70% in the first 6 months. RSV-related hospitalizations dropped by over 55% in the first 6 months. Studies have also found the monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab) to be effective at reducing RSV requiring medical care, including reducing serious RSV illness requiring hospitalization by 77% over 5 months."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "Are RSV immunization products safe?", "answer": "RSV maternal vaccine – RSVpreF Mild side effects, such as pain at the injection site, fever, and fatigue are common with the RSV maternal vaccine. Serious side effects are extremely rare. A large clinical trial and early data from use in countries showed the vaccine was generally well tolerated by pregnant women and their babies. Monoclonal antibody – nirsevimab Nirsevimab is effective in preventing RSV in healthy and high-risk infants and is well tolerated. Clinical trials and global use confirm a favourable safety profile, with extremely rare serious side effects. In countries that have implemented these products, safety is being closely monitored."}
{"topic": "/respiratory-syncytial-virus-(rsv)-immunization-products", "question": "Can RSV immunization products be administered with other vaccines?", "answer": "RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments can be administered alongside other routine vaccinations for pregnant individuals or infants. However, specific recommendations may vary by country. Consult your healthcare provider for specific recommendations in your country."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Why has the handbook been produced?", "answer": "As countries begin national efforts to improve quality of care, many have recognized the benefits of developing a coherent plan that provides structure, guidance and direction on quality of care at all levels of the health system. A national policy and strategy for quality of care can help clarify the linkages with other national health policies, plans and priorities, can highlight the importance of quality-focused actions for achieving health priorities, and also help to define lines of accountability for provision of quality people-centred health services. This handbook proposes an approach for developing national quality policy and strategy (NQPS). The handbook is not a prescriptive guide, but rather a structured approach that helps ensure that the development and implementation of NQPS are as comprehensive and smooth as possible."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Who is the handbook intended for?", "answer": "This handbook is designed for governments and policy-makers (at the national, sub-national and health facility levels) who consider whether and how to develop an NQPS or those already in the process of developing one. It may also be helpful for technical advisers, donors and other stakeholders supporting governments in areas related to quality of care. While much of this handbook has been designed to support the development of NQPS in low- and middle-income countries, which may face particular challenges to improving quality of care, the processes outlined are relevant to any national or subnational authority preparing or reviewing their national efforts on quality of care."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Why does the handbook focus on both policy and strategy?", "answer": "While terminology varies between different countries and organizations, the handbook proposes that there is value in countries developing both a policy and a strategy on quality of care. The policy is a statement of the vision, direction and rationale for the national effort to improve quality of care and may outline broad priorities to be addressed. It may be expressed in a number of different ways, for example as a separate policy document, a national statement, or as part of a broader national health policy document. Policy can be a useful tool for engaging stakeholders, building support for the national quality effort and establishing the structures and environment needed for success. The strategy aims to provide a clear explanation of how the policy will be put into practice, including detail on how each of the priorities will be met. The strategy provides a clear framework for organizing the action with the detail needed to drive implementation. Policy and strategy should, of course, be developed and applied in an integrated manner, taking account of country needs and context."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "How does this link to countries’ national health planning processes?", "answer": "Each country will approach the development of NQPS differently, but the handbook stresses the\r\ncritical importance of integration with existing health plans and priorities. Development of NQPS\r\nshould build on and complement the national health planning process. Quality of care is a key consideration for achieving universal health coverage, and the success of NQPS requires action all the way across the health system.  For more information on national health policy and planning,\r\nplease see the WHO Health Systems Governance webpage ."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Is this a WHO guideline?", "answer": "No. This handbook outlines an approach towards the development of NQPS and has been co-developed with countries that have embarked on their own national quality of care efforts, as well as technical partners, and experts from across WHO. It has also been informed by a review of existing national policies and strategies."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Does the handbook address disease and population specific quality initiatives, such as those for HIV and maternal and child health?", "answer": "In many countries, existing disease or population specific programmes are already engaged in important work to improve the quality of care. The Network for Improving Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health is an example of a multi-country initiative to ensure that every pregnant woman, newborn and the child receives good quality care with equity and dignity. The existing initiatives in each country can be key assets to inform the development and implementation of NQPS. The handbook discusses options for meaningful integration of relevant technical programmes."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Does the handbook propose suggested indicators for measuring quality of care?", "answer": "Measuring quality of care is difficult and complex. The handbook outlines a basic approach to strengthening information systems and selecting indicators to support NQPS and proposes carrying out a review of existing illustrative indicator lists as part of this process. The focus is on quality measurement that is achievable, of practical value to improve care, and context-specific. For a practical guide for measuring and monitoring quality of care to improve maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services, please click here ."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "Why does the handbook not describe quality improvement methods?", "answer": "The handbook focuses on the process for developing national policy and strategy on quality of care, which is essential for providing direction and structure to national efforts to enhance quality of care. Quality improvement plays a critical role in improving processes across the health-care system, and dedicated training and reference materials are available from a number of specialist technical organizations on this aspect."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "How does the handbook relate to WHO’s work on patient safety and infection prevention and control?", "answer": "Infection prevention and control (IPC) and patient safety are critical foundations for achieving quality\r\ncare. While the handbook focuses specifically on the development of national policy and strategy,\r\nWHO has produced detailed technical resources to support assessment and interventions for IPC and patient safety , both of which may be key early action areas within a national effort to improve\r\nquality of care."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-handbook-for-national-quality-policy-and-strategy", "question": "How can I access and share global learning on quality of care?", "answer": "The WHO Global Learning Laboratory for Quality of Care is a global community of practice that aims to share the experiences, expertise, passion and wisdom of people across the world, representing multiple disciplines, on important issues relating to quality of care. The community of practice is hosted on the Integrated Health Services Hub . The aim of this community of practice is to facilitate global learning informed by local action and front-line experiences in the area of quality of care."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "What causes mono and how do you get it?", "answer": "Mono is most often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus belongs to the Herpes viridae family, but mononucleosis is not a herpes infection. Mono infection is extremely common – most people will get infected with EBV at some point in their lives, often in childhood, without even realizing it because symptoms can be very mild. However, when teens or young adults get infected for the first time, they are more likely to develop the classic symptoms of mono. You mainly get mono through direct contact with the saliva of someone who has the virus. That's why it's nicknamed the kissing disease. It’s also transmitted by sharing things that touch the mouth, like drinks, eating utensils, toothbrushes or lip balm. Less commonly, it might spread through droplets from a cough or sneeze, or through blood or semen. Because the virus can stay in someone's saliva for months after they feel better, it's easy to spread without knowing it. Many people carry EBV without symptoms and can still pass it on."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "What are ways to prevent getting mono?", "answer": "Preventing mononucleosis can be tricky because the virus that usually causes it, Epstein-Barr virus, is very common and spreads easily through saliva. Many people carry EBV without even knowing it and can pass it on. However, you can take steps to lower your chances of catching it, especially from someone you know is sick. Since mono spreads through saliva, the best prevention is to avoid contact with an infected person's saliva. This means: don't share drinks: avoid sipping from the same cup, water bottle or can; don't share utensils: use your own forks, spoons and knives; don't share personal items: things like toothbrushes or lip balm can transfer      the virus; and avoid close contact: since it's called the kissing disease, avoid kissing      someone who has mono (or has recently recovered, as the virus stays in      saliva for weeks to months). While washing your hands regularly is good hygiene for preventing many illnesses, it's less effective against mono since it's not typically spread through hands. Focusing on not sharing items that touch the mouth is the most direct way to reduce your risk of getting mono."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "What are the main symptoms of mono?", "answer": "Mono symptoms can feel a lot like a bad case of the flu, but they tend to last longer. The most common signs usually show up about 4 to 6 weeks after you get infected and include: severe sore throat: it might hurt a lot to swallow, and your throat might look      very red fever: usually between 38.3 °C to 40 °C swollen lymph nodes: you might feel lumps in your neck, armpits or groin area swollen tonsils: they might look red and large, sometimes with white or yellowish      patches on them headache and body aches: similar to what you might feel with the flu extreme fatigue: feeling tired all the time, even after having a good amount of sleep loss of appetite. Some people might also get a rash or have a swollen spleen or liver, but these are less common. Symptoms often develop slowly and might not all appear at once."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "How long does mononucleosis last?", "answer": "How long mono lasts can vary quite a bit from person to person. Most of the main symptoms, like the fever and severe sore throat, usually start getting better within a couple of weeks. However, the swollen lymph nodes and tonsils might take a bit longer to go back to normal size, sometimes up to 4 weeks. The biggest issue for many people is the fatigue. The feeling of being extremely tired can linger for several weeks up to a few months after the other symptoms have gone away. This is why getting plenty of rest is so important when you have mono. Trying to push through the tiredness can sometimes make it last longer. Gradually increasing your activity level as you start to feel better is usually the best approach."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "Is mononucleosis contagious, and for how long?", "answer": "Yes, mono is contagious. As mentioned earlier, it spreads mainly through saliva. You are most contagious while you have symptoms like fever, but the Epstein-Barr virus can remain active in your saliva for a long time after your symptoms disappear – potentially for 6 months or even longer. Most people get infected with EBV and have no symptoms at all, or only very mild ones they mistake for a cold. These people can still carry the virus in their saliva and spread it to others without ever knowing they had mono. This is one reason why EBV is so widespread. To be safe, even after you feel better from mono, it's a good idea to avoid sharing drinks, utensils and toothbrushes, and avoid kissing people for a few months to reduce the chance of spreading it."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "What is the test for mononucleosis?", "answer": "Doctors can often make a diagnosis just based on your typical symptoms and a physical exam. If your doctor thinks you might have mono based on your symptoms (like severe fatigue, sore throat, fever and swollen lymph nodes), they might order a blood test to help confirm it. The most common test is called the monospot test (or heterophile antibody test). This test looks for specific antibodies (proteins your immune system makes to fight infection) that often show up in your blood when you have mono. However, the monospot test isn't perfect. It might come back negative early in the illness (especially in the first week or two), even if you do have mono. Sometimes, doctors might repeat the test later if symptoms continue. In other cases, especially if the monospot is negative but mono is still suspected, doctors might order different blood tests that look specifically for antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus. These tests are more specific and can help tell if you have a current, recent or past EBV infection."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "What is the treatment for mononucleosis?", "answer": "Since mono is caused by a virus (usually EBV), antibiotics won't help – they only work against bacteria. There isn't a specific medicine that cures mono. The treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms and helping your body fight off the infection. This is called supportive care. These are most important things you can do: Get plenty of rest. Your body needs energy to recover, and the fatigue can be      intense. You might need to stay home from school or work and avoid sports      for several weeks. Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice and broth help prevent dehydration and can      soothe a sore throat. Relieve pain and fever. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (paracetamol)      or ibuprofen can help with fever, sore throat and body aches. Avoid giving      aspirin to teens due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious      condition. Soothe your sore throat. Gargling with salt water (one quarter to one half      teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water) or using throat lozenges or      sprays can help. It's also crucial to avoid contact sports or heavy lifting for at least 3–4 weeks, even if you feel better, because mono can cause your spleen to swell, making it fragile and at risk of rupturing, which is a medical emergency. Always follow your doctor's advice on when it's safe to return to normal activities."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "Does mononucleosis affect the tonsils?", "answer": "Yes, mono commonly affects the tonsils. Swollen, inflamed tonsils are one of the classic signs of the illness. When you have mono, your tonsils can become quite enlarged and red. Often, they develop white or yellowish patches or a coating on their surface – this is called exudate. This swelling and coating contribute significantly to the severe sore throat and difficulty swallowing that many people with mono experience. In some cases, the tonsils can swell so much that they almost touch each other in the back of the throat (sometimes called kissing tonsils). This can make breathing feel a bit difficult, although serious breathing problems are rare. The swelling and soreness in the tonsils usually get better along with the other main symptoms like fever, typically within a couple of weeks, but sometimes it can take a bit longer for them to return completely to their normal size. Using salt water gargles and pain relievers can help manage the discomfort."}
{"topic": "/mononucleosis-(glandular-fever)", "question": "Does mononucleosis cause a rash?", "answer": "Mono can sometimes cause a skin rash, although it's not one of the most common symptoms like fatigue or sore throat. If a rash does occur with mono itself, it often looks like faint, flat pink or reddish spots spread across the body (a nonspecific maculopapular rash). It usually doesn't itch very much. However, a more common reason people with mono get a rash is if they are mistakenly given certain antibiotics, particularly ampicillin or amoxicillin. These antibiotics are often prescribed for bacterial throat infections like strep throat. If someone actually has mono (which is viral) and takes one of these specific antibiotics, they are very likely (up to 90% of the time) to develop a widespread, often itchy, red rash. This reaction doesn't mean they are allergic to the antibiotic in general; it's a specific reaction that happens when these drugs interact with the mono infection. This is one reason why it's important for doctors to consider mono if you have a severe sore throat before prescribing antibiotics."}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "What is overweight and obesity?", "answer": "Overweight and obesity are defined as ''abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health''. Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. The problem is global and is steadily affecting many low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. The prevalence has increased at an alarming rate. Globally in 2024, the number of overweight children under the age of 5 years is estimated to have been over 35 million. Almost half of all overweight children under 5 lived in Asia and one quarter lived in Africa. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. Overweight and obesity, as well as their related diseases, are largely preventable. Prevention of childhood obesity therefore needs high priority."}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "How are overweight and obesity measured in children?", "answer": "The most commonly used measure for overweight and obesity is weight-for-height in children under 5 years old. The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index to classify overweight and obesity in school-age children, adolescents and adults. It is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m2). The BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity, as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered as a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same body fat percentage in different individuals. It is difficult to develop one simple index for the measurement of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents because their bodies undergo a number of physiological changes as they grow. Depending on the age, different methods to measure a body's healthy weight are available: For children aged 0–5 years The WHO Child Growth Standards, launched in April 2006, include measures for overweight and obesity for infants and young children up to age 5 years. The WHO Child Growth Standards WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, 0-5 years. For individuals aged 5–19 years WHO developed the Growth Reference Data for 5–19 years. It is a reconstruction of the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO reference and uses the original NCHS data set supplemented with data from the WHO child growth standards sample for young children up to age 5. Growth reference data for 5-19 years Global school-based student health survey (GSHS)"}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "Why does childhood overweight and obesity matter?", "answer": "Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability in adulthood. Overweight and obese children are more likely to stay obese into adulthood and to develop noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. For most NCDs resulting from obesity, the risks depend partly on the age of onset and on the duration of obesity. Obese children and adolescents suffer from both short-term and long-term health consequences. The most significant health consequences of childhood overweight and obesity, which often do not become apparent until adulthood, include: cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke) diabetes musculoskeletal disorders, especially osteoarthritis certain types of cancer (endometrial, breast and colon). In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and digestive disorders (1)."}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "What is the double burden of malnutrition?", "answer": "Many low- and middle-income countries are now facing the so-called double burden of disease. As they continue to struggle with the problems of infectious diseases and under-nutrition, at the same time they are experiencing a rapid increase in risk factors of NCDs such as obesity and overweight, particularly in urban settings. It is not uncommon to find under-nutrition and obesity existing side by side within the same country, the same community or even within the same household in these settings. This double burden is caused by inadequate prenatal, infant and child nutrition, which is then followed by exposure to high fat, energy dense, micronutrient poor foods and a lack of physical activity as the child grows older."}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "What are the causes of childhood overweight and obesity?", "answer": "The fundamental cause of childhood overweight and obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Global increases in childhood overweight and obesity are attributable to several factors. First, there has been a global shift in diet towards increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat and sugars but low in vitamins, minerals and other healthy micronutrients. There is also a trend towards decreased physical activity levels due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of recreation time, changing modes of transportation and increasing urbanization. WHO recognizes that the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity results from changes in society. Childhood obesity is mainly associated with unhealthy eating and low levels of physical activity, but the problem is linked not only to children's behaviour but also, increasingly, to social and economic development and policies in the areas of agriculture, transport, urban planning, the environment, food processing, distribution and marketing, as well as education. The problem is societal and therefore it demands a population-based multisectoral, multidisciplinary and culturally relevant approach. Unlike most adults, children and adolescents cannot choose the environment in which they live or the food they eat. They also have a limited ability to understand the long-term consequences of their behaviour. They therefore require special attention when fighting the obesity epidemic."}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "What can be done to fight the childhood obesity epidemic?", "answer": "Overweight and obesity, as well as related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. It is recognized that prevention is the most feasible option for curbing the childhood obesity epidemic since current treatment practices are largely aimed at bringing the problem under control rather than effecting a cure. The goal in fighting the childhood obesity epidemic is to achieve an energy balance which can be maintained throughout the individual's life span. WHO recommends the following to reduce and prevent childhood overweight and obesity: limit portion sizes; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts; limit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats; limit the intake of sugars; and be physically active and accumulate at least 60 minutes of regular, moderate- to vigorous-intensity activity each day that is developmentally appropriate."}
{"topic": "/noncommunicable-diseases-childhood-overweight-and-obesity", "question": "What needs to be done at the societal level?", "answer": "Curbing the childhood obesity epidemic requires sustained political commitment and the collaboration of many public and private stakeholders. Governments, international partners, civil society, NGOs and the private sector have vital roles to play in shaping healthy environments and making healthier diet options for children and adolescents affordable, and easily accessible. It is therefore WHO's objective to mobilize these partners and engage them in implementing the Global strategy on diet, physical activity and health . WHO supports the designation, implementation, monitoring and leadership of actions. A multisectoral approach is essential for sustained progress; the Organization mobilizes the combined energy, resources and expertise of all global stakeholders involved."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition", "question": "What is malnutrition?", "answer": "Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers 2 broad groups of conditions. One is undernutrition, which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals). The other is overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer)."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition", "question": "What are the consequences of malnutrition?", "answer": "Malnutrition affects people in every country. Around 890 million adults worldwide are living with obesity, while 390 million are underweight. An estimated 35.5 million children under the age of 5 years are overweight, while some 150 million are stunted. Adding to this burden are the 605 million or 31% of women of reproductive age around the world affected by anaemia. Many families cannot afford or access enough nutritious foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat and milk, while foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt are cheaper and more readily available, leading to a rapid rise in the number of children and adults who are overweight and obese, in poor as well as rich countries. It is quite common to find undernutrition and overweight within the same community, household or even individual – it is possible to be both overweight and micronutrient deficient, for example."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition", "question": "What is being done to address malnutrition?", "answer": "In April 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition from 2016 to 2025. The Decade aims to catalyse policy commitments that result in measurable action to address all forms of malnutrition. The aim is to ensure all people have access to healthier and more sustainable diets to eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide. In March 2025, the UN General Assembly extended the Decade of Action to 2030. This extension aims to maintain the political momentum to end malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 at global, regional and national levels and to align its objectives with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."}
{"topic": "/ageing-ageism", "question": "What is ageism?", "answer": "Ageism refers to the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or oneself based on age."}
{"topic": "/ageing-ageism", "question": "Who does ageism affect?", "answer": "Ageism affects everyone. Children as young as 4 years old become aware of their culture’s age stereotypes. From that age onwards they internalize and use these stereotypes to guide their feelings and behavior towards people of different ages. They\r\n    also draw on culture’s age stereotypes to perceive and understand themselves, which can result in self-directed ageism at any age. Ageism intersects and exacerbates other forms of disadvantage including those related to sex, race and disability."}
{"topic": "/ageing-ageism", "question": "Where is ageism seen?", "answer": "Ageism is everywhere: from our institutions and relationships to ourselves. For example, ageism is in policies that support healthcare rationing by age, practices that limit younger people’s opportunities to contribute to decision-making in the\r\n    workplace, patronizing behavior used in interactions with older and younger people, and in self-limiting behavior, which can stem from internalized stereotypes about what a person of a given age can be or do."}
{"topic": "/ageing-ageism", "question": "Is ageism really a problem?", "answer": "Half the world’s population is ageist against older people and, in Europe, the only region for which data is available on all age groups, younger people report more age discrimination than other age groups. Ageism can change how we view ourselves, can erode solidarity between generations, can devalue or limit our ability to benefit from what younger and older populations can contribute, and can impact our health, longevity and well-being while also having\r\n    far-reaching economic consequences. For example, ageism is associated with earlier death (by 7.5 years), poorer physical and mental health, and slower recovery from disability in older age. Ageism also increases risky health behaviors, such as eating\r\n    an unhealthy diet, drinking excessively or smoking, and reduces our quality of life. In the United States, one in every seven dollars spent on health care every year for the eight most expensive conditions was due to ageism (US$ 63 billion in total)."}
{"topic": "/ageing-ageism", "question": "Can we combat ageism?", "answer": "Three strategies work in reducing or eliminating ageism: policy and law, educational activities and intergenerational interventions. Policy and law can address discrimination and inequality on the basis of age and protect the human rights of everyone, everywhere. Educational activities can enhance empathy, dispel misconceptions about different age groups and reduce prejudice by providing\r\n    accurate information and counter-stereotypical examples. Intergenerational interventions, which bring together people of different generations, can help reduce intergroup prejudice and stereotypes."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "Are these guidelines radically different from what happens in surgical practice now?", "answer": "Many of these recommendations have existed for a while but health workers are not necessarily following them. We hope these new WHO guidelines will draw attention to the need to change practices in order to save lives. They itemize a range of important changes and recommend ways to help health providers change the behaviour of health workers. For example, patients are still often shaved before surgery – this practice needs to stop, given the evidence (see below)."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "How will these guidelines help to stop the spread of antibiotic resistance?", "answer": "The use of certain antibiotics is associated with the risk of emergence in antibiotic resistance, which is a global problem. A number of the guideline recommendations detail when to use and not to use antibiotics, aimed to help over- and mis-use of these valuable drugs."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "I am having surgery soon, am I at risk?", "answer": "Surgery always involves risk and the risk of infection can never be completely eliminated. Risk is generally highest in low- and middle-income countries, because of insufficient equipment, staffing and poor infrastructure, as well as lack of policies and knowledge, for example."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "Is any one of the recommendations more important than the others?", "answer": "No, they’re all equally important and each can play a role in reducing the risk of infection. Health providers will make their own decisions about which recommendations to prioritize based on their own context, existing measures, resources and so on."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "The guidelines recommend using warming devices to prevent SSIs. How does warming a patient help?", "answer": "A cold operating room and the effects of anaesthesia, for example, can lead to low body temperature (hypothermia). The human body compensates for this by reducing blood flow, which in turn slows wound healing, increasing the risk of infection. Warming a patient, for which a range of affordable devices are available, ensures that healing is optimized, reducing the opportunity for infections to develop."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "The guidelines say that surgical teams should either use disposable non-woven gowns or reusable woven gowns. Why?", "answer": "Sterile surgical gowns are worn over the scrub suit of the operating team to maintain a sterile surgical area and to reduce the risk of the spread of germs to both patients and staff. Two types of gowns are traditionally used in the operating room: disposable and reusable gowns. The material of both must be impermeable to liquids and germs. The cost is similar for both disposable and reusable items, but both are not available in all countries."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "What are surgical site infections and how common are they?", "answer": "Surgical site infections are caused by bacteria that get in through incisions made during surgery. They threaten the lives of millions of patients each year and contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance. In low- and middle-income countries, 11% of patients who undergo surgery are infected in the process. In Africa, up to 20% of women who have a caesarean section contract a wound infection, compromising their own health and their ability to care for their babies. But surgical site infections are not just a problem for poor countries. In the United States, they contribute to patients spending more than 400 000 extra days in hospital at an additional cost of US$ 900 million per year."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "What’s the difference between these guidelines and WHO’s Surgical Safety Checklist?", "answer": "The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (published in 2009) identified a wide range of measures aimed at keeping patients safe during surgery. These new guidelines focus, in much greater detail, on one specific area of surgical safety, namely preventing surgical site infections."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "Why do the guidelines recommend that surgical patients not be shaved? How does hair removal increase the risk of infection?", "answer": "Removing hair from the intended site of surgical incision has traditionally been part of the routine preparation for surgery, and has been considered necessary to facilitate adequate exposure, skin marking and suturing. However, hair removal can increase the risk of infection by causing microscopic trauma of the skin (i.e. cuts). The evidence now tells us that there is a clear benefit to not removing hair, or if absolutely necessary, to just clipping it instead of shaving."}
{"topic": "/surgical-site-infections", "question": "Why should antibiotics be used to prevent infections before surgery, but not afterwards?", "answer": "There is evidence showing that antibiotics given at a set time before surgery will usually prevent infections occurring, for certain surgical procedures. This is called prophylaxis. However, there is no evidence to show that using antibiotics for prophylaxis after surgery prevents infection in any way. In fact, it may even be harmful by contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics should only be used after surgery to treat infections, not to prevent them."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "I have COVID-19, should I be prescribed corticosteroids like dexamethasone?", "answer": "Corticosteroids are lifesaving medicines recommended for patients with severe or critical COVID-19*. They should be given along with other current standard of care treatments for COVID-19, which currently include oxygen and other medications. They should not be given to patients with non-severe* COVID-19. In rare circumstances, they can be harmful to these patients’ health. *A patient has severe COVID-19 when they have signs of pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, and their blood oxygen level is low. A patient has critical COVID-19 when they need life sustaining treatment, have acute respiratory distress syndrome, or have septic shock (evidence of injury to other organs). For more information, see Therapeutics and COVID-19: Living guideline, 10 November 2023 ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "What are corticosteroids and how do they work against COVID-19?", "answer": "Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant qualities that are used to treat a wide range of conditions. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 develop an overstimulation of the immune system, which can be very harmful to their health. Corticosteroids reduce this overstimulation, which helps balance the immune system responses so that they are effective and do not cause damage to the person themselves."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "What is the benefit of corticosteroid treatment?", "answer": "Current evidence comes from the combined results of 8 clinical trials, utilizing data from 7000 patients with low oxygen levels, which show that dexamethasone (or other corticosteroids) reduces COVID-19 deaths. Data from these studies show that deaths are reduced by 20% when patients with severe COVID-19 are given corticosteroid treatment during their illness. There is also a benefit in reducing the need for ventilation (putting patients on a machine to help with breathing)."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "How are corticosteroids administered and what is the dosage?", "answer": "Corticosteroids are given as a pill or via injection, depending on formulation Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 should be given low dose corticosteroids for 7-10 days. The daily dose depends on the corticosteroid being used."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "Are corticosteroids suitable for anyone with COVID-19?", "answer": "WHO recommends that only patients who have severe or critical COVID-19 receive corticosteroids."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "Is dexamethasone prequalified by WHO?", "answer": "Yes, WHO has prequalified dexamethasone solution for injection. It is produced by 3 manufacturers for use in treating COVID-19 illness. Prequalification means that the drug has been assessed by WHO and deemed safe and effective in treating COVID-19 illness."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "Do patients receiving corticosteroids need monitoring?", "answer": "WHO recommends that all patients, even those without diabetes, should be monitored when taking corticosteroids. This is because corticosteroids can increase blood glucose (sugar) levels temporarily. High blood glucose levels caused by corticosteroids usually only require monitoring until the steroids are stopped. Certain patients should be monitored closely when receiving corticosteroids since they are at increased risk of developing complications. These include people with diabetes, cancer, open wounds following traumatic injuries, severe burns or malnourishment. Patients taking immunosuppressants/immunomodulators, those with severe immunodeficiencies and intravenous drug users should also be monitored."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "How expensive are corticosteroids? Are they widely available?", "answer": "Corticosteroids are readily available at a low cost globally. Corticosteroids are included in the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines. The most commonly used corticosteroid, dexamethasone is an off-patent, common supportive treatment option and is generally affordable. WHO’s 2016 and 2019 surveys of different health facilities in low- and middle-income countries indicated that dexamethasone was available to patients at a median price of US$ 0.33 per 4mg/ml injection ampoules (range: US$ 0.13–3.5)."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "What are the typical side effects of corticosteroids, including dexamethasone?", "answer": "Corticosteroids including dexamethasone are generally safe. Their benefits far outweigh the risks, particularly in patients with severe forms of pneumonia. Higher blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) can occur, and patients should be monitored for this, particularly if they have diabetes. Treatments are usually short, and even at high doses, corticosteroids are not associated with other serious side effects. Prolonged use (i.e., use for more than 2 weeks) may be associated with adverse events such as glaucoma, cataract, fluid retention, hypertension, psychological effects (e.g., mood swings, memory issues, confusion or irritation), weight gain, or increased risk of infections and osteoporosis."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-dexamethasone", "question": "Can corticosteroids be used in children/the elderly/pregnant?", "answer": "Yes, they can be used to treat sick children, the elderly and during pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-hydroxychloroquine", "question": "Does WHO recommend hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19?", "answer": "WHO does not recommend hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19. This recommendation is based on findings from 6 trials, with more than 6000 participants, who did not have COVID-19 and received hydroxychloroquine. Using hydroxychloroquine for prevention had little or no effect on preventing illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19. Taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 may increase the risk of diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, drowsiness and headache. More information can be found here. Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat autoimmune diseases including arthritis. While considered generally safe, several adverse events are associated with its use, and it should only be used under medical supervision."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-hydroxychloroquine", "question": "Does WHO recommend hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19?", "answer": "WHO does not recommend hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. This recommendation is based on findings from 30 trials with more than 10 000 COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce mortality, the need for or duration of mechanical ventilation. Taking hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 may increase the risk of heart rhythm problems, blood and lymph disorders, kidney injury, liver problems and failure. More information can be found here . Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat autoimmune diseases including arthritis. While considered generally safe, several adverse events are associated with its use, and it should only be used under medical supervision."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "Will over-use of alcohol-based handrubs result in resistance?", "answer": "Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, there is no reported or likely resistance to alcohol-based handrubs. Indeed, the more it is appropriately used, the less antibiotic-resistant bacteria are able to spread."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "Does alcohol dry the hands or sting when applied?", "answer": "Modern alcohol-based handrubs should not (if used correctly) dry the hands. Some staff may be familiar with the generation of alcohol-based handrubs which contained no skin softeners (emollients). Today’s handrubs all contain skin softeners which help prevent drying. Of the published studies available, many describe that nurses who routinely use alcohol rubs have less skin irritation and dryness than those using soap and water. Alcohol handrubs will sting if the staff member has any cuts or broken skin. Such areas should be covered with waterproof plasters. Allergic contact dermatitis due to alcohol-based handrubs is very rare."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "How many times can staff use the alcohol rubs?", "answer": "There is a common misconception that hands should be washed after every four or five applications of alcohol-based handrub. There is no reason to do this, other than personal preference in some cases (i.e. if hands feel like they need washing or in hot and highly humid climates)."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "Since launching the Guidelines, are you aware off any problems with patients or staff drinking the product?", "answer": "There have been some reports in the UK and USA of patients drinking alcohol-based handrubs. This is clearly a concern when considering large-scale implementation of these handrubs, and risks should be satisfactorily addressed. A thorough risk assessment should be undertaken. If this is considered to be a risk, these risks can be reduced by issuing staff with handrubs rather than placing them around the bed space. Alternatives include alcohol-based handrub formulation to be locked in wall dispensers. These are the strategies commonly employed in facilities where small children are being cared for. It is important to ensure that placement of the handrubs is targeted at the points of care. Many of the risks associated with alcohol-based handrubs can be further minimized by sensible location of the bottles, aligned with the Five Moments and point of care philosophy."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "Are health care staff adversely affected in any way by the alcohol when cleaning their hands?", "answer": "There is no evidence to suggest this. Published studies to date have shown that after using the handrubs, alcohol levels found in the blood are insignificant (ethanol) or not detectable (iso-propyl)."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "What advice do you have in light of the reports that some countries are considering banning ethanol due to theoretical harmful effects caused by inhalation?", "answer": "On the basis of current evidence, both ethanol and isopropanol are safe to use for hand hygiene. The World Alliance for Patient Safety through its Global Patient Safety Challenge programme has established a Task Force of experts to address this issue and to research and verify the potential consequences of ethanol. The Guidelines are being pilot-tested to determine the efficiency of recommendations. The Task Force for investigating the potential harm of ethanol is compiling data on this. Some specific studies have looked at inhalation of ethanol and this has resulted in some countries reviewing its use. However, for hand hygiene, due to the limited time of exposure alcohol is not absorbed in measurable quantities. . In the unlikely event that the Task Force finds ethanol use should be limited, then this formulation will not be recommended by the WHO. The Guidelines will be finalized before the end of 2008."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "What are the fire hazards relating to alcohol-based hand rub?", "answer": "All alcohol based products are potentially flammable and therefore they should be stored away from high temperatures and flames. The WHO suggests that all health-care organisations currently using alcohol-based handrub should undertake local risk assessments. The benefits of the alcohol in terms of infection prevention far outweigh the fire risks . A study in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (Kramer et al 2007) found that hand rubs have been used in many hospitals for decades, representing an estimated total of 25,038 hospital years of use. The median consumption was between 31 L/month (smallest hospitals) and 450 L/month (largest hospitals), resulting in an overall consumption of 35 million L for all hospitals. A total of 7 non-severe fire incidents were reported. No reports of fire caused by static electricity or other factors were received, nor were any related to storage areas."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "What can be done to minimize fire risks?", "answer": "The control of fire risks requires a co-ordinated approach by fire officers, fire safety advisors, risk managers, health & safety, and infection control professionals, and involves the risk assessment of points of use and storage, as well as general\r\n    safety requirements. Risk assessments should be carried out on the use of alcohol handrubs, the location of dispensers, the storage of stock and the disposal of used containers/dispensers and expired stock, giving consideration to the risks of fire. Allow the handrub to dry: Staff should be advised to let their hands dry and the vapours disperse after using alcohol handrub, which minimises these risks. The How to Handrub posters state clearly: \"once dry, your hands are safe\". Storage In order to avoid running out of handrub, ward areas and clinical units may hold reserve stock locally. Local and central (bulk) storage must comply with fire regulations regarding the type of cabinet and store, respectively. Production and storage facilities should ideally be air-conditioned or cool rooms. No open flames or smoking should be permitted in these areas. The WHO–recommended formulation handrub should not be produced in quantities exceeding 50 L locally, or in central pharmacies lacking specialized air conditioning and ventilation. Since undiluted ethanol is highly flammable and may ignite at temperatures as low as 10oC, production facilities should directly dilute it to the concentrations outlined in the Guide. The flash points of ethanol 80% (v/v) and isopropyl alcohol 75% (v/v) are 17.5°C and 19°C, respectively. National safety guidelines and local legal requirements must be adhered to, in regard to the storage of ingredients and the final product. Care should be taken when carrying personal containers/dispensers to avoid spillage onto clothing, bedding, or curtains, and in pockets, bags or vehicles. Containers / dispensers should be stored in a cool place, and care should be taken regarding the securing of tops / lids. The quantity of handrub kept in a ward or department should be as small as is reasonably practicable for day-to-day purposes. A designated ‘Highly Flammables’ store will be required for situations where it is necessary to store more than 50 L (e.g. central bulk storage). Containers and dispenser cartridges containing handrub should be stored in a cool place away from sources of ignition. This also applies to used containers that have not been rinsed with water. Disposal issues Used containers and dispensers will contain gel residues and flammable vapours. Rinsing out used containers with large quantities of cold water will reduce the risk of fire and the containers may then be recycled or disposed of in general waste. Location of dispensers Handrub dispensers should not be placed above or close to potential sources of ignition, such as light switches and electrical outlets, or next to oxygen or other medical gas outlets, due to the increased risk of vapours igniting. Handrub dispensers should not be sited in any corridor that forms part of a means of escape (i.e. outside the ward). Fire Safety Advisors may need to be consulted. If dispensers are placed in a circulation area within a ward (e.g. outside bedded areas)\r\n        it is recommended that they are at least 1.2 metres apart, the circulation area is at least 2 metres wide and the maximum container size is 1 litre. The siting of handrub dispensers above carpets is not recommended due to the risk of damage and lifting/warping of carpets. Consideration should be given to the risks associated with spillage onto floor coverings, including the risk of pedestrian slips. This advice is based on a Fire Modelling Analysis Report prepared for the American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) in the US in 2003. Regions should check with local regulatory agencies for specific guidelines. Patients and visitors Clear instructions for use should be displayed at handrub dispenser points intended for use by visitors to clinical areas. These should include warnings not to use excessive amounts, and not to smoke immediately after use. Spillages Significant spillages should be dealt with immediately by removing all sources of ignition, ventilating the area and diluting with water (to at least ten times the volume). The fluid should then be absorbed by an inert material such as dry sand (not a combustible material such as sawdust) which should then be disposed of in a chemical waste container. Vapours should be dispersed by ventilating the room (or vehicle) and the contaminated item should be put in a plastic bag until it can be washed and/or dried safely. N.B. Fighting a large (i.e. bulk storage) alcohol fire using water or aqueous (water) film-forming foam (AFFF) extinguishers may be ineffective and may spread the fire over a larger area rather than put it out."}
{"topic": "/alcohol-based-handrub-risks-hazards", "question": "Where should alcohol-based handrub dispensers be located?", "answer": "As described within the risk minimization section, handrub dispensers should not be placed above or close to potential sources of ignition, such as light switches and electrical outlets, or next to oxygen or other medical gas outlets, due to the increased risk of vapours igniting."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "What is Chagas disease?", "answer": "Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi or T. cruzi . It is found mainly in Latin American countries, where it is mostly vector-borne. The main vector involved in the transmission of the parasite to humans is a triatomine bug, also known as a ‘kissing bug’. An estimated 7 million people are infected worldwide, mostly in Latin America. Chagas disease is clinically curable if treatment is initiated at an early stage. Therefore universal access to prompt diagnosis and care is essential. Once totally confined to the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease has spread to other continents over the last century mainly because of enhanced means of travel and global population movement to and from Latin America. It is estimated that over 10 000 people die every year from clinical manifestations of Chagas disease, and more than 100 million people are at risk of acquiring the disease. Vector control remains the most useful method to prevent infection. Blood screening is vital to avoid infection through transfusion and organ transplantation. Screening and diagnosis in pregnant women and their children are essential control measures. Chagas disease is named after Carlos Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian doctor, who discovered the disease in 1909."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "What is the vector of Chagas disease?", "answer": "The Chagas disease vector is an insect of the Hemiptera order (adults have wings and fly), Reduviidae family and Triatominae subfamily (which feed on blood at all stages of their development) and mainly from the genera Triatoma , Panstrongylus and Rhodnius , but also from 12 other genera. In the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease is transmitted by several species of the triatomine bugs that typically live in the cracks of poorly constructed dwellings in rural areas and suburban slums in Latin America. The bugs hide during the day and emerge at night to feed on human blood, usually when people are asleep. Other infected triatomine bug species may be found in areas surrounding houses and in wild environments. Exchange of infection is therefore possible in such environment. Distribution of vectors The distribution of vectors and wild reservoirs of T. cruzi in the Americas extends from the United States of America to Argentina and Chile (latitudes 46°N to 46°S). Triatomine bugs have also been found outside the Region of the Americas, but up to now none of them have been found to be infected. More than 150 species of triatomine bugs and >100 species of mammals, mostly wild species, maintain T. cruzi infection in nature. With such a wide reservoir, Chagas disease is not eradicable. The vector was first described in 1773 by the Swedish scientist Charles De Geer, through the observation of an insect captured in the old so-called \"Indies\" (assumed to refer to the East Indies, probably Indonesia). Triatomine bug species with the capacity to transmit T. cruzi have been identified since the 18th century along maritime travel routes to parts of Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. Increased global population mobility increased the possibility of establishing vector transmission to areas where Chagas disease was previously non-endemic, especially in Asia, where the vector is naturally abundant, and even infest houses in large numbers."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "How is Chagas disease transmitted?", "answer": "In the Region of the Americas, T. cruzi is mainly transmitted to humans through the infected faeces of the blood-sucking triatomine bug, which is the disease vector. This insect normally hides during the day and becomes active at night, when it feeds on human blood. In its search for a blood meal, the bug usually bites an exposed area of the skin (such as the face - hence its common English name, “kissing bug”). Right after its blood meal, it defecates close to the bite. The parasite, T.cruzi found in the faeces of the bug, is transmitted when the person rubs the area of the bite in an instinctive reaction to the itch (caused by the bite), thereby putting the faeces in contact with the bite. The parasite can also be transmitted when the parasite comes in contact with the mucous membrane of the eyes or mouth or through any other skin lesion. Transmission can occur through contaminated food infected with the vector’s faecal matter. This frequently generates oral outbreaks, especially in hot and humid climates. Other means of transmission involve transfusion of contaminated blood and from infected mothers to child during pregnancy or during delivery (congenital transmission). Less frequently, organ transplantation or laboratory accident can result in transmission. Outside the Region of the Americas, transmission does not occur through the faeces of the infected vector, but rather through non-vectorial routes. Cases of infection outside Latin America have been reported among travellers returning from endemic regions, adopted children, migrants and recipients of blood transfusion or organ transplants. Globalisation and increased international travel and trade between endemic and non-endemic countries make Chagas disease a growing concern at the global level."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?", "answer": "Chagas disease has two successive phases: an acute phase and a chronic phase . Most acute phases are asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms. During the chronic phase patients may also be symptom-free but some may progress to clinical forms of the disease (cardiac, digestive and/or neurological), which can be life threatening if left undiagnosed and untreated. Initial acute phase The initial acute phase lasts for about two months after infection. During this phase, a high number of parasites circulate in the blood. In most cases, symptoms are absent or mild, but may include fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, cough, difficulty in breathing, liver enlargement , generalized body swelling, diarrhoea, heart inflammation (with chest pain and even heart failure) and, less frequently, meningoencephalitis (with seizures and even paralysis). In less than 50% of people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs can be a skin lesion (chagoma) or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (Romaña sign). The acute phase can occur at any age but is frequently more severe in children aged <2 years, the elderly and in people who are immunosuppressed or in individuals infected with a high number of parasites. Meningoencephalitis is the most frequent manifestation in people suffering from AIDS. Chronic phase The acute phase is followed by the chronic phase, during which parasites are hidden mainly in the heart and digestive muscle. Different clinical forms may be observed: the indeterminate form, the most frequent form, asymptomatic and without apparent signs of disease, is typically found immediately after the acute phase and is life-long in most patients; the cardiac form occurs in up to a third of patients, affecting the heart’s electrical conduction system, causing arrhythmia, heart muscle disorder, heart failure and embolisms; the digestive form (generally enlargement of the esophagus and/or the colon), observed in the South of the Amazon basin, or a mixed form that affects the heart, the digestive system and the autonomic nervous system occurs in ≤15% of patients. Depending on cardiac damage, the mortality rate in a period of 10 years may range from 9 to 85%. Patients usually die, by frequency order, from sudden death caused by arrhythmias, heart failure and vascular cerebral accident, often in early adult life."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "How is Chagas disease diagnosed?", "answer": "During the acute phase or during reactivation because of immunosuppression (which can be caused by old age, radiation, chemotherapy or AIDS), diagnosis is made by direct detection of the parasite circulating in the bloodstream. To this end a blood wet smear or a blood concentration technique such as microhaematocrit or Strout technique, must be used. Stained preparations, such as malaria films, detect the parasites when parasitaemia is high (acute phase). In the Amazon Basin, microscopy technicians who diagnose malaria have been trained to detect acute individual cases of Chagas disease and, through them, identify possible foodborne outbreaks. During the chronic phase , when the parasite is hidden in target tissues, diagnosis is made via the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi (serological techniques) using serological tests. Some of the most frequently used techniques are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, western blot and rapid diagnostic tests such as immunochromatography. For strict research purposes, molecular tests (qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and parasitological tests (haemoculture and xenodiagnosis – with examination of the faeces of uninfected triatomine bugs that have fed from an infected patient’s blood) may also be used."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "What is the treatment against Chagas disease?", "answer": "Treatment is urgently indicated for anyone during the acute phase and for those in whom the infection has been reactivated (immunosuppression). In these situations, treatment is almost 100% effective, and the disease can be completely cured. However, efficacy decreases as the duration of the infection lengthens. Moreover, infants are less likely to have adverse events from treatment but this risk increases with age. Treatment is also indicated for infants with congenital infection and for patients during the early chronic phase. Adults, especially those with the indeterminate form of the disease, should be offered treatment, but its potential benefits in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the long duration and frequent adverse events. During the late chronic phase, when cardiac or digestive manifestations may occur, additional lifelong medical treatment and surgery are usually indicated. As described earlier, the two medicines used for treatment are benznidazole, often the first-line treatment in most countries; and, nifurtimox. The main contraindications to treatment are pregnancy and kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. Both nifurtimox and benznidazole are donated to WHO by Bayer AG and Insud Pharma Group, respectively, and are made available mostly free of charge to the national health services of countries requesting these drugs.

{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "How to prevent Chagas disease?", "answer": "There is no vaccine to prevent Chagas disease. However, the following prevention and control tools are useful depending on the geographical area(s) affected: insecticide spraying of houses and surrounding areas; home improvements to prevent vector infestation (such as plastering walls, and installing concrete floors and corrugated iron roofs); good hygiene practices in food preparation, transportation, storage and consumption; personal preventive measures such as bednets; screening of blood donors; testing of organ, tissue and cell donors and receivers; observance of the standard safety protocols (wearing laboratory coats, gloves, face masks, caps and glasses) for laboratory accidents prevention Additionally, key tools of congenital transmission control are the screening of infected pregnant women and the early detection of possible infection in neonates (secondary prevention) and their siblings to provide early diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis of an infected newborn can be made at birth by detecting parasites directly in the umbilical cord or venous blood of the baby or when the infant is aged 8 months by detecting antibodies against T. cruzi . In areas where malaria is also transmitted, a system of surveillance for Chagas disease has been recently implemented. Malaria microscopy technicians have been trained to identify T. cruzi parasites in malaria films and detect acute Chagas disease in individual cases. Through them, possible foodborne outbreaks and active transmission areas for the disease may be also detected and controlled."}
{"topic": "/chagas-disease", "question": "Why are Chagas disease diagnosis indexes low?", "answer": "The present low diagnosis indexes are strongly related to psychosocial rather than biomedical challenges. Among others, the following are well described determinants: Stigma - Forgotten disease or forgotten population? (Pinto Dias) For a long time, Chagas disease was a strictly found in rural areas, plaguing only certain regions of the countryside, usually characterized by poverty and exclusion. To many, Chagas disease symbolises much more than an illness, almost always associated with poverty in rural areas and impoverished house infested with triatomine bugs. Although the epidemiology of Chagas disease has changed because of migration and globalization, it is still associated with the poverty-stricken hut. Today, the disease is found in cities but the social stigma associated with infection remains strong. The social consequences of stigma can be extremely severe; indeed, infection with T. cruzi can lead to social rejection. Infection can also mean work restriction because its association with poor health and potential difficulties in performing work, and even sudden death, creating a fear of financial losses by employers. For these reasons many people are reluctant to seek screening and medical help, which can lead to more serious complications and further spread of the disease. Emotional burden of Chagas disease Studies have shown that local communities in endemic countries do not have a clear understanding of Chagas disease. Instead people in rural areas merge preconceptions, forging an overall mixed and incorrect concept of the disease, its origin and consequences. For many, Chagas disease is not necessarily associated with its vector or its symptoms, but more with feelings of despair, fear of death and suffering. This negative approach drastically affects health-seeking behaviour as people develop adaptive behaviours, such as refusing to get screened thereby compromising both treatment and diagnosis. Chagas disease diagnosis in non-endemic countries Globalisation has led to a rise in awareness about Chagas disease as an emerging issue in non-endemic regions. However, many practitioners in non-endemic countries still consider Chagas disease to be a tropical illness restricted to Latin America, and this assumption causes many misdiagnoses when presented with cardiomyopathies or other clinical manifestations of the disease. Similarly, patients infected with T. cruzi in non-endemic countries may not be aware of their condition which can lead to further transmission through blood and organs donation, for instance. Training health personnel to facilitate diagnosis and provide medical care can greatly help to mitigate transmission and improve prognosis. Regulatory practices in some countries require people applying for employment to go through a compulsory T. cruzi serology. Although the aim is to protect patients with Chagas disease, this practice has resulted in discrimination against infected individuals., causing instead, hindrance and stigmatization. Lack of understanding and knowledge of the disease, along with incorrect beliefs, are clear obstacles to promoting health-seeking behaviour."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "What types of dengue vaccines are available?", "answer": "There is a growing public health need for effective preventive interventions against dengue, a disease caused by four viruses, termed serotypes 1–4. Currently, only one vaccine is available for dengue prevention. WHO recommends the use of Q-denga® (TAK-003) in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high intensity of dengue transmission. The vaccination course consists of two injections given 3 months apart."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "What is Qdenga® (TAK-003)?", "answer": "TAK-003 is a live-attenuated vaccine containing weakened versions of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 developed by Takeda. TAK-003 uses the DENV2 strain as the genomic backbone. The vaccine schedule is a 2-dose series three months apart, given to specific age groups and in specific circumstances according to WHO recommendations."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "What are WHO’s recommendations related to TAK-003?", "answer": "WHO recommends the use of TAK-003 in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high dengue transmission intensity. WHO does not currently recommend the programmatic use of TAK-003 in children aged <6 years because of the lower efficacy of the vaccine in this age group. Furthermore, the dengue seropositivity rate in this age group is generally low, even in high dengue transmission settings. The vaccine is recommended as a 2-dose schedule with a minimum interval of 3 months between doses. It is not advised to reduce the interval between doses. If the second dose is delayed for any reason, it is not necessary to restart the series and the second dose should be administered at the first available opportunity. WHO recommends that countries consider introducing TAK-003 into their routine immunization programmes in geographical locations where high transmission intensity of dengue poses a significant public health problem. Many countries may have a heterogeneous geographical distribution of dengue transmission intensity and could consider targeted subnational introduction. Until the efficacy–risk profile for DENV3 and DENV4 in seronegative persons has been more thoroughly assessed, WHO does not recommend the programmatic use of TAK-003 vaccine in low to moderate dengue transmission settings. Persons with comorbidities who live in dengue-endemic countries could be offered vaccination, even if they fall outside the recommended age range for programmatic use (6–16 years), provided that a substantial country-specific burden of severe dengue outcomes in these subpopulations has been documented. Until more data on efficacy-safety profiles become available, WHO recommends the lower age limit of 6 years, and the upper limit of 60 years for vaccination in persons with comorbitities."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "What is the definition of high dengue transmission intensity?", "answer": "To determine dengue transmission intensity, countries look at age-specific seroprevalence and age-specific hospital admissions for dengue. A seroprevalence rate (percentage of people in a population who have antibodies that show they have been exposed to dengue virus) of more than 60% by the age of 9 years or a mean age of peak dengue-associated hospitalizations below the age of 16 years could be considered as indicators of high dengue transmission."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "Who should not get a dengue vaccine?", "answer": "The TAK-003 vaccine should not be administered to: people who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant at least 1 month following vaccination; people who are breastfeeding; people with congenital or acquired immune deficiency, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids (for example 20 mg/day or 2 mg/kg body weight/day of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination; and people with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection associated with evidence of impaired immune function."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "Can the dengue vaccine be administered with other vaccines?", "answer": "Available evidence supports co-administration of TAK-003 with yellow fever and hepatitis A vaccines. Studies to assess co-administration with HPV vaccines are ongoing."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "Will vaccination fully protect me against dengue?", "answer": "TAK-003 does not prevent all cases of dengue. Vaccination against dengue should be viewed as part of an integrated strategy to control the disease, including vector control, proper case management, community education and community engagement. Comprehensive vector control must remain a critical component of dengue control programmes. Furthermore, the mosquito vectors of dengue transmit other important viruses, including yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses."}
{"topic": "/dengue-vaccines", "question": "Is the dengue vaccine recommended for travellers to dengue endemic countries?", "answer": "Persons living in non-endemic countries who have previously been infected with any of the 4 dengue virus serotypes following travel to dengue-endemic countries may benefit from TAK-003 vaccination to prevent a second (and hence potentially more severe) dengue infection when travelling again to an endemic country. Frequent travellers, long-term travellers, migrants and long-term expatriates have a higher likelihood of previous dengue infection (and are therefore more likely to be seropositive) compared to first-time or short-term travellers. The benefits of vaccination with TAK-003 are lower for travellers who have never experienced dengue infection (and are therefore seronegative) compared to travellers who are seropositive. Check with your healthcare provider if dengue vaccination is needed."}

These include diagnostic services required for monitoring their progress and services that provide antiretroviral treatment (ART). Some of these challenges are related to suspensions and reductions in official development assistance (ODA). In some cases, governments are stepping in to reestablish services that were previously provided through other sources of funds. In some countries and locations, these adjustments may take time to be established. Communities of people living with HIV have and continue monitoring the extent of service disruptions and are offering advice and support to those affected. Several networks have issued helpful guidance for individuals who may run out of antiretrovirals (ARVs) and other medications due to local or central drug stock ruptures and/or clinic closures. HIV programmes, nongovernmental organizations and community-based organizations are urgently working to maintain HIV essential services and to provide support and relevant local information during this period of uncertainty. It is important that all stakeholders work together to minimize the risk of HIV treatment interruptions, maintain the core clinical monitoring needs and ensure referrals to available services or providers for ongoing care."}
{"topic": "/guidance-on-handling-interruptions-in-antiretroviral-treatment-due-to-hiv-service-disruptions--drug-shortages--or-stockouts", "question": "What are WHO’s recommended antiretroviral treatment regimens?", "answer": "WHO currently recommends a combination tablet containing all three components of a complete ART regimen be taken once daily. Most adults and adolescents are taking a combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir, also known as TLD. However, other similar drug regimens (e.g. tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine and bictegravir) can be also used in some programmes as the standard treatment. Children’s ART regimens usually include abacavir, lamivudine and dolutegravir, which may be administered as multiple tablets or as a single fixed dose combination. In some cases, adults, adolescents and children may be on alternate regimens containing other medicines such as lopinavir boosted by ritonavir, or darunavir boosted by ritonavir."}
{"topic": "/guidance-on-handling-interruptions-in-antiretroviral-treatment-due-to-hiv-service-disruptions--drug-shortages--or-stockouts", "question": "What can you do if you face disruptions in your access to HIV medication?", "answer": "It is important to take ARVs daily according to the recommended schedule. However, if there is a shortage of ARV medications there are a few important things to remember: If you are unable to obtain your usual medicines because your clinic is closed, ARVs may be available in another hospital or clinic. A first step is to check with your local network of people living with HIV, or community-based organizations, or check online information (internet websites, social media groups) to find out if there are other places where you can register and obtain your medications near your living area. It is important to know which medicines make up your regimen to ensure you are given the same treatment that you were taking before. It can be helpful to keep an empty container with the description of the regimen composition as a reminder of the medications you have been taking."}
{"topic": "/guidance-on-handling-interruptions-in-antiretroviral-treatment-due-to-hiv-service-disruptions--drug-shortages--or-stockouts", "question": "Can you share medicines with friends or family members?", "answer": "If someone you trust has medicines and offers to share it with you, this may be a temporary solution if they are taking the same regimen. It is not advised to share medicines with someone who is taking a different regimen. If you have leftover pills from a previous regimen speak to a health-care worker before you substitute these for your latest regimen. If your new regimen contains a different class of drugs, then it may be preferable for you to simply stop taking all the HIV treatment medicines in the short term. There may also be issues related to the expiry date of your old regimen."}
{"topic": "/guidance-on-handling-interruptions-in-antiretroviral-treatment-due-to-hiv-service-disruptions--drug-shortages--or-stockouts", "question": "Is it safe to skip some days to make my pills last longer?", "answer": "Extending the amount of medication you take by skipping days, cutting tablets, or only taking one ARV out of a multi-tablet regimen without speaking to your doctor is not recommended, as this may increase the risk of developing drug resistance. There are a few preliminary studies demonstrating that treatment interruptions, or taking ARVs for 4 or 5 consecutive days each week and skipping pills on other days, may work when people have achieved HIV viral load suppression , are healthy, and can remember to take their medicines on the right schedule. It is not advisable to use this strategy to extend your supplies of medicine unless you are being supervised and advised by a health-care worker."}
{"topic": "/guidance-on-handling-interruptions-in-antiretroviral-treatment-due-to-hiv-service-disruptions--drug-shortages--or-stockouts", "question": "What will happen if I stop taking ARVs?", "answer": "If you are running low on medicines and are unable to obtain a treatment refill, it may be necessary to stop taking ART. Whether you are taking a regimen with one tablet, or a regimen with multiple tablets, it is strongly advised to stop all ARVs at the same time . If you were previously doing well on treatment, stopping ART for a few weeks will not be immediately harmful. There will be no immediate effects or symptoms; however, the level of virus in your blood, or viral load, will begin to increase within the first few weeks off treatment. This also increases the risk of HIV transmission, so it will be important to use condoms if you are sexually active. Longer treatment interruptions (months to years) will progressively weaken your immune system due to a decline of your CD4 cell count and can lead to the development of opportunistic infections and disease progression. There is a higher risk of disease progression for people who have previously been diagnosed with advanced HIV disease (AHD) . Infants and young children often have rapid disease progression and face higher risk of illness or death after stopping ARVs."}
{"topic": "/guidance-on-handling-interruptions-in-antiretroviral-treatment-due-to-hiv-service-disruptions--drug-shortages--or-stockouts", "question": "What should you do if you are pregnant or breastfeeding?", "answer": "If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, stopping ARVs increases the risk of transmission of HIV to your child. It is important to restart medicines as soon as possible. There are also medicines that can be given to your child to help protect him against infection. Speak with a health-care worker to find out where these medicines are available for your child. If your infant has less than 6 months of age, it is only advisable to stop breastfeeding if you can access sufficient and safe infant formula to replace breastmilk. Use of animal milk (e.g. cow, goat, sheep) is not appropriate for infants with less than 6 months of age as they are unable to digest it. Speak with a health-care worker if you have questions about safely feeding your child. In infants and young children, HIV disease progression is also more rapid. They may become immunosuppressed more quickly than observed in adults and adolescents, so it is critical to maintain access to paediatric ARV medicines for infants and younger children."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "Does polio still exist? Is it curable?", "answer": "Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases in more than 125 endemic countries, to two endemic countries (as of 2025). This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease, thanks to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a global public-private partnership. Despite the progress achieved since 1988, as long as a single child remains infected with poliovirus, children in all countries are at risk of contracting the disease. The poliovirus can easily be imported into a polio-free country and can spread rapidly amongst unimmunized populations. Failure to eradicate polio would result in global resurgence of the disease. There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. For more on the global effort to eradicate polio, please visit the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website at www.polioeradication.org ."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "What is wild poliovirus?", "answer": "Wild polioviruses are the naturally occurring strains of poliovirus that circulate in the environment. There are three serotypes of wild poliovirus: type 1, type 2, and type 3. Immunity to one serotype does not confer immunity to the other two. Outbreaks were largely unknown prior to the 20th century. However, with improved sanitation in the 20th century, the average age at which individuals were exposed to the virus increased. With progressively declining protection from maternal antibodies, infection increasingly resulted in paralysis. Type 2 wild poliovirus was declared eradicated in September 2015, with the last virus detected in India in 1999. Type 3 wild poliovirus was declared eradicated in October 2019. It was last detected in November 2012. Only type 1 wild poliovirus remains."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "What is variant (vaccine-derived) polio?", "answer": "Circulating variant (vaccine-derived) poliovirus, are rare, but such strains have been increasing in recent years due to low immunization rates within communities. cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) are the most prevalent. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) that has brought the wild poliovirus to the brink of eradication has many benefits: the live attenuated (weakened) vaccine virus provides better immunity in the gut, which is where polio replicates. The vaccine virus is also excreted in the stool, and in communities with low-quality sanitation, this means that it can be spread from person to person and actually help protect the community. However, in communities with low immunization rates, as the virus is spread from one unvaccinated child to another over a long period of time (often over the course of about 12–18 months), it can mutate and take on a form that can cause paralysis just like the wild poliovirus. This mutated poliovirus can then spread in communities, leading to cVDPVs. The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. Well over 20 million cases have been averted since large-scale administration of OPV began when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched. Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of the virus."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "What is the difference between oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)?", "answer": "The development of effective vaccines to prevent paralytic polio was one of the major medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative uses two types of vaccine to stop polio transmission – inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). If enough people in a community are immunized against polio, the virus will be deprived of susceptible hosts and will die out. High levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained to stop transmission and prevent outbreaks occurring. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is constantly assessing the optimal use of the different types of vaccine to prevent paralytic polio and stop poliovirus transmission in different areas of the world. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) is safe and extremely effective, and the most common kind of vaccine used in the fight to eradicate polio. There are different types of OPVs that protect against one, a combination of two, or all three different serotypes of polio – types 1, 2, and/or 3. Unlike the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), OPV has a unique ability to stop person-to-person spread of poliovirus. Additionally, it is easier to administer and can be distributed quickly on a large scale. The use of OPV has helped reduce global polio cases by over 99% since 1988, and it remains a vital tool in the effort to end polio everywhere. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was developed in 1955 by Dr Jonas Salk. Also called the Salk vaccine IPV consists of inactivated (killed) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. IPV is given by intramuscular or intradermal injection and needs to be administered by a trained health worker. IVP produces antibodies in the blood to all three types of poliovirus. In the event of infection, these antibodies prevent the spread of the virus to the central nervous system and protect against paralysis."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of the opal polio vaccine?", "answer": "Advantages OPVs are all inexpensive (US$ 0.15–0.20 for countries procuring through UNICEF). OPVs are safe and effective and offer long lasting protection for individuals against the serotype(s) which they target. For several weeks after vaccination the vaccine virus replicates in the intestine, is excreted and can be spread to others in close contact. This means that immunization with OPV can result in ‘passive’ immunization of people who have not been vaccinated. OPVs are administered orally and do not require health professionals, sterile needle syringes or a complex cold chain system. As such, OPVs are easy to administer in large-scale vaccination campaigns and to transport to hard-to-reach areas. Disadvantages OPV is safe and effective. However, in extremely rare cases (at a rate of approximately 1 in 2.7 million doses) the weakened vaccine-virus in OPV can cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). The extremely low risk of VAPP is accepted by public health programmes given the strong protection OPV otherwise provides. In places where not enough children are immunized against polio, the weakened vaccine-virus can pass through the community and, in rare instances over time, genetically revert to a form that can cause paralysis. This is known as variant poliovirus, or cVDPV."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "What are advantages and disadvantages of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)?", "answer": "Advantages As IPV is not a ‘live’ vaccine, it carries no risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). IPV triggers an excellent protective immune response in most people. Disadvantages IPV induces very low levels of immunity in the intestine. As a result, when a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus, the virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the faeces, risking continued circulation. IPV is over five times more expensive than OPV. Administering the vaccine requires trained health workers, as well as sterile injection equipment and procedures. Safety IPV is one of the safest vaccines in use. No serious systemic adverse reactions have been shown to follow vaccination. Efficacy IPV is highly effective in preventing paralytic disease caused by all three types of poliovirus."}
{"topic": "/poliomyelitis", "question": "Which polio vaccine is recommended?", "answer": "An increasing number of industrialized, polio-free countries are using IPV as the vaccine of choice. This is because the risk of paralytic polio associated with continued routine use of OPV is deemed greater than the risk of imported wild virus. However, as IPV does not stop transmission of the virus, OPV is used wherever a polio outbreak needs to be contained, even in countries which rely exclusively on IPV for their routine immunization programme. Once polio has been eradicated, use of all OPV will need to be stopped to prevent re-establishment of transmission due to VDPVs."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss-safe-listening", "question": "How do loud sounds affect my ears?", "answer": "Sensory cells within our ears help us to hear. Exposure to loud sounds over time causes fatigue of these sensory cells. The result is temporary hearing loss or tinnitus. A person enjoying a loud concert, for example, may afterwards experience muffled hearing or a ringing or buzzing in their ears (known as tinnitus). This often improves as the sensory cells recover. However, with regular exposure to loud or prolonged noise, the sensory cells and other structures can become permanently damaged, resulting in irreversible noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus, or both. The hearing loss caused by exposure to loud sounds is called noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Noise-induced hearing loss can be immediate (such as when exposed to a sudden burst of loud sound); however, more often the loss is gradual, permanent, and frequently goes unnoticed or ignored until the effects become more obvious. Initially, you may only have trouble hearing some high-pitched sounds like bells or birdsong. As it progresses, NIHL can make it difficult to communicate with others, especially in loud places like restaurants and markets."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss-safe-listening", "question": "How can I protect my hearing from loud sounds? What is safe listening?", "answer": "The term safe listening simply refers to specific listening behaviours that do not put your hearing at risk. The volume of sounds, the duration of listening, and frequency of exposure to loud sounds all have an impact on hearing. The higher the level of sound and longer the duration, the greater the risk of hearing loss. For example, you can safely listen to a sound level of 80dB for up to 40 hours a week. If the sound level is 90dB, the safe listening time reduces to four hours per week. To protect your hearing: Keep the volume down . This can be done by setting your device’s volume level to no more than 60% of maximum. If you are using an app to monitor your sound level, it is best to stay below 80dB average. Use well-fitted, and noise cancelling headphones to reduce the need to raise volume in noisy situations. In noisy places, use ear protectors such as earplugs . Always stay away from sources of sound , such as loudspeakers, noisy machinery etc. Limit time spent engaged in noisy activities . Give your ears a break frequently from loud sounds. This helps the sensory cells inside the ears to recover. Monitor sound levels . This can be done by using apps. Choose devices with built-in safe listening features that allow you to monitor your exposure. Heed the warning signs of hearing loss . Contact a professional if you have persistent ringing in the ear ( tinnitus ) or have difficulties hearing high-pitched sounds or following conversations."}

For the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, these criteria include: Evidence of dependence potential of the substance, Similarity to other substances under the Convention with regard to abuse and/or evidence of likelihood of abuse, Extent of harm to public health and social problems, Therapeutic applications of the substance, Depending on the outcome of the assessment of a specific substance, the Committee may recommend to: Place the substance under international control (i.e. place it in one of the Schedules) Transfer the substance to a different schedule with more or fewer control measures Delete the substance from a Schedule, effectively removing it from being under international control) Keep the substance under surveillance"}
{"topic": "/expert-committee-on-drug-dependence", "question": "What is the difference between a pre-review and critical review?", "answer": "If a substance has a known therapeutic use, a pre-review may be initiated to determine if there is sufficient information to proceed to a critical review. Not all substances will be assessed by a pre-review but a pre-review is normally carried out if the substance is used as a medicine. A pre-review can also be an opportunity to identify gaps in the available scientific data that would need to be addressed to enable a critical review. A critical review takes place if the ECDD working group recommend a substance be reviewed, after a pre-review has recommended the substance proceeds to the critical review, or if there has been a formal notification by a Member State. Substances that are placed under international control are regulated by the International Drug Control Conventions, which restrict international production and trade of these substances. Individual countries can exercise discretion in how they will apply controls within their territories."}
{"topic": "/expert-committee-on-drug-dependence", "question": "What does scheduling status mean?", "answer": "Psychoactive substances are classified and placed under international control in compliance with international conventions ratified by United Nations (UN) Member States, namely: 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances The purpose of these classifications is to control the use of these drugs to protect public health. For countries, this may include limits on the possession, consumption, trade, distribution, import or export, manufacture and production of substances controlled under these schedules. The scope of the 1961 Single Convention was limited to drugs with cannabis-, cocaine- and opium-like effects and did not cover the many new psychotropic substances discovered later. The 1971 Convention is designed to control psychoactive drugs such as amphetamine-type stimulants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and hallucinogens."}

{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "What are tinnitus and tinnitus disorder?", "answer": "Tinnitus is the perception of a noise, such as ringing, buzzing, or hissing, in the ears when no external sound is present. It can be perceived in one ear, in both ears or inside the head. Tinnitus can be perceived as constant or intermittent. The sound perceived by a person experiencing tinnitus can be continuous, pulsatile (at the same time as the heartbeat), or rhythmic in nature. These different types of tinnitus can have different causes (1) . Tinnitus can be acute (a duration of less than 3 months) or chronic (more than 3 months). Tinnitus is not bothersome in all people who perceive it (2) . When the perception of tinnitus is associated with emotional distress or cognitive dysfunction this is termed tinnitus disorder. In other words, “tinnitus” describes the symptom and perception of it, whereas “tinnitus disorder” reflects the symptom and the associated suffering (1) ."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "What causes tinnitus?", "answer": "Tinnitus can be caused by many factors, and not all factors are known. Common causes are related to ear or hearing problems including: age-related hearing loss exposure to loud sounds ear infections earwax buildup medications that cause damage to the hearing organs (also known as ototoxic). Other relevant causes are: head or neck injuries acoustic neuromas (also known as vestibular schwannoma, a benign tumour on the vestibular nerve) muscle tensions in the neck or jaw stress and emotional trauma certain medical conditions like Ménière’s disease. In rare cases tinnitus can be caused by sounds that are generated inside the body, e.g. by blood flow or muscle contractions (3,4) ."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Should I see a doctor about my tinnitus?", "answer": "Yes, a doctor can help determine the cause and suggest appropriate treatments. While tinnitus is in most cases benign, it can in rare circumstances indicate a more serious condition, such as vestibular schwannoma (a benign tumour on the vestibular nerve) or Ménière’s disease. If you experience sudden tinnitus, dizziness or hearing loss, you should see a doctor. You should see a doctor especially if tinnitus: is sudden and is accompanied by hearing loss, dizziness or pain has persisted for over 3 months (chronic tinnitus) affects your quality of life (10) ."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Is there a cure for tinnitus?", "answer": "Tinnitus may resolve on its own if caused by temporary factors, such as an ear infection or short-term exposure to loud noise. Occasionally, tinnitus may be caused by blockage of the ear canal by earwax. In such cases, wax removal can alleviate it. Chronic tinnitus, on the other hand, is less likely to go away, though it can be managed effectively. There are also documented cases where tinnitus has disappeared, even after many years of being chronic (13) . There is no definitive cure for tinnitus, but there exist various treatments and strategies that can reduce tinnitus severity including tinnitus counselling cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) use of hearing aids and cochlear implants therapies such as tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) and sound therapy neuromodulation (electrical or magnetic stimulation of the nervous system) stress management (5,11,12) . At this time no pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective for the management or resolution of tinnitus. Helpful strategies for tinnitus management aim to focus attention away from tinnitus (e.g. concentrating on work or any other activity) and to reduce the emotional reaction to tinnitus. To achieve these goals, cognitive behavioural therapy, sound therapy, hearing aids, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) and techniques for stress management can be helpful."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Can stress make tinnitus worse?", "answer": "Current research indicates that there is an association between stress and tinnitus, however there is not a clear causal link (14) . Stress management techniques such as relaxation exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy CBT can help reduce its impact (15) . In some cases, lifestyle adjustments may also be beneficial."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Can hearing aids or cochlear implants help with tinnitus?", "answer": "Hearing aids can be effective for some people with tinnitus and hearing loss (16) . They amplify external sounds, making tinnitus less noticeable and improving overall hearing. In persons with tinnitus and severe hearing loss or deafness, cochlear implants can be highly effective in terms of tinnitus suppression."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Can lifestyle changes help prevent or reduce tinnitus?", "answer": "The most important risk factor for tinnitus is hearing loss. Protecting the ears from loud sounds is highly effective at preventing hearing loss and reduces the risk to develop tinnitus. Smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and coffee drinking and/or caffeine intake are examples of lifestyle-related risk factors thought to be related to tinnitus; however, there is no clear consensus on the nature of the relationship, or the extent to which they can influence a person’s tinnitus (17,19,20) . It is always worth consulting with your physician to see if any dietary changes are appropriate for you and your lifestyle. Simple lifestyle changes that can help reduce tinnitus include: protecting your ears from loud sounds managing stress effectively eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly developing good sleep habits (sleep hygiene) collaborating with healthcare professionals for personalized guidance (17) ."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Is tinnitus a sign of hearing loss?", "answer": "Tinnitus is in most of cases associated with hearing loss, especially age-related or sound-induced hearing loss. However, it can occur without hearing loss as well."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "How does loud sound cause tinnitus?", "answer": "Exposure to loud sounds can damage the hair cells in the inner ear, which can lead to hearing loss and, in some cases, tinnitus. The extent of the damage depends on the noise level and the duration of exposure, and it can be temporary or permanent. Smartphones and smartwatches now feature built-in sound level meters that can measure the loudness of your environment with reasonable accuracy."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Does tinnitus get worse with age?", "answer": "The prevalence of tinnitus increases with age. This is partly explained by the fact that hearing loss, which the occurrence of tinnitus is associated with, also increases as a result of the natural ageing process (also referred to as presbycusis). It is also understood that the tinnitus experience itself changes with age, especially in cases of chronic tinnitus, where older adults can experience subjectively louder, more troublesome and more distressing tinnitus than younger patients (18) ."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "Can tinnitus cause hearing loss?", "answer": "Tinnitus itself does not cause hearing loss but can be associated with damage to the hearing system. Tinnitus can also make it harder to focus on external sounds, which might seem like a decrease in hearing ability."}
{"topic": "/deafness-and-hearing-loss--tinnitus", "question": "What can help me manage my disturbed sleep patterns as a result of tinnitus?", "answer": "Many people with tinnitus experience difficulties falling asleep. To manage these issues several strategies can be helpful: relaxation techniques: techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can reduce stress and promote better sleep; sound therapy: using soothing sounds can mask the tinnitus, making it easier to fall asleep. White noise sounds from a sound pillow (a pillow with an integrated speaker), or earphones can be effective in alleviating the perception of tinnitus; and sleep hygiene: maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule is crucial. It is also important to avoid stimulants such as coffee and alcohol in the evening, as well as heavy exercise close to bedtime. Establishing a consistent bedtime routine and ensuring a relaxing environment can improve sleep quality (17) ."}
{"topic": "/population-ageing", "question": "Why is the population ageing?", "answer": "Longer lives are one of our most remarkable collective achievements. Advances in social and economic development as well as in health have lowered mortality rates, particularly among older people, meaning most people can now expect to live into their sixties and beyond. At the same time, factors such as urbanization, higher education and access to family planning have led to smaller family sizes and fewer births, resulting in fewer children in many countries. Consequently, individuals aged 60 and above are growing in number and outnumbering younger people, leading to population ageing. This fundamental shift presents opportunities for more people to make the most of longer lives and new challenges if adaptations are not made to how societies are structured across all sectors."}
{"topic": "/population-ageing", "question": "What are the public health implications of global ageing?", "answer": "Globally, life expectancy at birth reached 73.3 years in 2024, an increase of 8.4 years since 1995. The number of people aged 60 and older worldwide is projected to increase from 1.1 in 2023 to 1.4 billion by 2030. This trend is particularly evident and rapid in developing regions. This demographic shift has significant implications for public health. Maintaining good health is crucial for older people to remain independent and actively participate in family and community life. Engaging in lifelong health promotion and disease prevention strategies can significantly reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable and chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke and cancer, as well as functional impairments. Early detection and treatment of these conditions are essential to minimizing their impact. Public health initiatives can leverage the capacities and abilities of older people. The growing population of older individuals plays a vital role by volunteering, sharing their experience and knowledge, assisting their families with caregiving responsibilities, and increasing their participation in the workforce. In this context, the United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) emphasizes four specific areas for action: 1) combatting ageism, 2) creating age-friendly environments, 3) integrating care in primary care, and 4) providing long-term care for those who need it. Addressing ageism requires a fundamental shift in societal attitudes, feelings and behaviours towards ageing and older persons. Age-friendly environments empower older individuals to lead dignified lives by addressing social determinants of health and promoting supportive communities that enhance their well-being. Integrated care guarantees that health services effectively address the diverse needs of older people, fostering a comprehensive person-centred approach that encompasses physical, mental and social well-being. Long-term care is vital for individuals who require assistance from others for everyday life, as it ensures they receive the necessary support to sustain their quality of life with dignity. By focusing on these key areas, public health initiatives can significantly enhance the lives of older people, empowering them to make meaningful contributions to society while enjoying healthier and more fulfilling lives."}
{"topic": "/population-ageing", "question": "What issues related to ageing are WHO working on?", "answer": "Although people are, on average, living longer than ever before, globally there is little evidence that older people today are in better health than previous generations. Furthermore, good health in older age is not distributed equally, either between or within generations. WHO works with Member States, UN agencies and diverse stakeholders from various sectors to close the gap between longer lives and healthier lives by fostering healthy ageing in every country. WHO does this work in line with the United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) – a global collaboration that brings together diverse sectors and stakeholders to improve the lives of older people, their families and the communities in which they live. WHO serves as the Secretariat of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing. The UN Decade of Healthy Ageing defines the following four action areas: combatting ageism – changing how we think, feel, and act towards age and ageing; age-friendly environments – ensuring that communities foster the abilities of older people; integrated care – delivering person-centred integrated care and primary health services responsive to older people; and long-term care – providing access to long-term care for older people who need it. In addition to these action areas, WHO also works on cross-cutting issues related to ageing, such as the abuse of older people and social isolation and loneliness."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "What is excess mortality?", "answer": "Excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is used to quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. Excess mortality is defined as the difference between the total number of deaths estimated for a specific place and given time period and the number that would have been expected in the absence of a crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). This difference is assumed to include deaths attributable directly to COVID-19 as well as deaths indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic through impacts on health systems and society, minus any deaths that would have occurred under normal circumstances but were averted due to pandemic-related changes in social conditions and personal behaviours. Estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic encompass deaths from all causes. In certain locations, these estimates may also capture excess deaths related to other crises such as extreme weather, disasters or conflicts. These non-COVID-19 pandemic related deaths are removed from the final estimates to isolate excess mortality solely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "Why is excess mortality the preferred measure?", "answer": "While aggregate COVID-19 case and death numbers are being reported to WHO, they do not always provide a complete picture of the health burden attributable to COVID-19. In general, reported death numbers under-estimate the number of lives lost due to the pandemic, there are several reasons for this. They miss those who died without testing, they are contingent on the country correctly defining COVID as the cause-of-death and they miss the increases in other deaths that are related to the pandemic leading to overwhelmed health systems or patients avoiding care. A few countries have experienced lower than expected total deaths during the pandemic due to reduced contact and reduced mobility, which have led to reduced infectious disease related mortality as well as reduced transport and injury related fatalities. Reported COVID-19 death numbers do not account for this. In light of the challenges posed by using reported data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, excess mortality from all causes is considered a more objective and comparable measure that accounts for both the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "Why do the estimates show negative excess deaths for some countries?", "answer": "Negative excess deaths could be observed if deaths that would have happened in the absence of the pandemic were averted due to measures taken to deal with the pandemic. Some public health measures (e.g., lockdown, social distancing, mask wearing, working from home) have led to decrease in the number of deaths from causes other than COVID-19. For instance, during lockdowns, fewer deaths due to road traffic injuries and seasonal flu were observed due to the restricted movement of people."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "Why are the WHO estimates different from estimates produced by others?", "answer": "It is important to note that other groups and countries have produced excess death estimates. The difference in the estimates produced by WHO and those produced by other groups are due to key differences in the input data used and assumptions made including how the expected deaths are calculated, the statistical model used, and the variables used to predict deaths in locations where limited or no data is available. There might also be variations of the period/month/week assessed. To minimize these differences, uncertainty intervals are provided."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "What are the challenges in calculating excess mortality?", "answer": "Mortality data to calculate actual deaths in real-time are available in only a subset of countries where reporting systems are functioning effectively, and historical datasets to calculate expected deaths are also often incomplete. Many countries do not have the mortality surveillance capacity to generate and collect data in a timely manner and these data gaps mean that excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries using standard methods."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "Where can I review the methodology used to calculate the estimates for each country?", "answer": "The methodology paper can be found here . In light of the evolving situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the\r\nestimates  will be updated periodically as more data becomes available."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "Is a one-size-fits-all model used to produce excess mortality estimates?", "answer": "WHO produces estimates using statistical modelling for all global health estimates, often with the advice of technical experts, to ensure robust statistical standards are followed and facilitate global comparability. This is the standard approach followed also by other UN agencies for global estimates. The model adopted for estimating excess deaths is not a one-size-fits-all approach. WHO, in collaboration with the TAG, scrutinizes the relationships between excess mortality and certain contextually relevant variables in locations with good quality data to estimate excess mortality in countries with limited data. This approach takes the specificity of countries (e.g., income level, reported COVID-19 death rates, test positivity rate, containment index) into consideration while ensuring global comparability. Countries may have their own approach to estimating excess deaths that may produce results that are different from those produced by WHO."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "What are the limitations of these estimates and methods?", "answer": "Every model approximates reality. Models are subject to trade-offs, not least the balance between comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. WHO’s estimates of the excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also approximations in a rapidly evolving pandemic with regard to transmissibility and severity. It is worth noting that WHO relies on models to compile a wide range of global health statistics. This is necessary as not all countries have high quality information systems, or those that do cannot always share their data in a timely manner. Therefore, WHO works with countries to strengthen their data and health information systems, while at the same time makes the best use of the data currently available to generate high quality evidence. Specifically with regard to the excess mortality estimates, the model uses relationships that have been quantified using data from the countries with high quality systems for data reporting. We extrapolate these relationships to settings that are in many ways systematically different across multiple dimensions such as health systems capacity, underlying disease burden and age-structure. Countries have differed on when they experienced waves and how they responded, and quantifying this temporal relationship between COVID-19 surges or the effects of the emergence of variants is not trivial. In some settings the country responses were reactive but in many others they were proactive. As such, despite the effort to calibrate the model such that it is accurate in different settings, one of the more important limitations to note is that the input data have limited representation and this model generalizes the covariate relationships quantified to settings that may be systematically different from those observed. The final model is intentionally parsimonious. This reduction in complexity means it is not possible for such a reduced set of variables to explain all the variation that is observed across countries. While the variables chosen are contextually relevant and are found to explain a significant component of the variation in excess, the underlying population characteristics that drove these differences are too complex to capture perfectly in a single global model and, hence, the trade-offs referred to above have had to be made. The estimates, therefore, are the best possible at this time for the period of analysis and have some degree of uncertainty around them."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "What process did the WHO follow to calculate the estimates?", "answer": "In February 2021, in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), WHO convened a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on COVID-19 Mortality Assessment to advise on the development of analytical methods for estimating excess mortality in all countries. The COVID TAG is comprised of leading demographers, epidemiologists, data and social scientists and statisticians from a range of backgrounds and geographies. Under Working Group I of the TAG (Working Group I: Global excess mortality estimates including COVID-19), members considered several statistical models and after assessing performance, interpretability as well as extensibility, the TAG proposed a Poisson regression model (parameterized to account for over-dispersion) to predict the total number of deaths from all causes during the pandemic period, conditional on the monthly expected deaths over the period and a predicted relative rate parameter which is modelled using country-specific variables. The model has been used by WHO to generate estimates for countries and regions for which adequate input data were available for reliable inference and to predict estimates for countries with no data available. In addition to determining levels of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the expertise of the TAG is also being leveraged to develop methods for disaggregating the estimated number of excess deaths by age and sex. WHO’s estimates are produced following the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting ( GATHER )."}

{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "What is a country consultation process and what are countries consulted on?", "answer": "It is a regular process that WHO consults with its Member States when producing new estimates. Circular Letter (C.L. 29.2021) is shared through WHO’s official list of addresses with all Member States requesting the designation of a national focal point to interact with the technical team in this process. Designated focal points for each Member State are requested to review estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the data sources and methods used, and to share primary data sources that may not have been previously available to WHO. Any additional feedback is also taken into consideration during the country consultation. The draft estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic prepared for each country and the methodology applied to produce these estimates are then made available for download and accessible through WHO’s Country Portal. The WHO estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic aim to offer a comprehensive and comparable set of country estimates disaggregated by sex and age for the period of analysis during the pandemic period. Designated national focal points review and upload supporting data and provide feedback on estimates via the WHO Country Portal. National focal points interact with the WHO Global Health Estimates team. Regional webinars and a Mission Briefing (for Permanent Missions in Geneva) are usually organized to present the estimates and methodology and provide opportunity to respond to any questions."}

{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "What is WHO's guidance on certifying COVID-19 deaths?", "answer": "A death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due to COVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of preexisting conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "How is WHO supporting countries to strengthen national health information systems?", "answer": "At the heart of WHO’s Transformation Agenda is a commitment to support countries to strengthen their data and health information systems and make progress towards achieving the Triple Billion targets\r\nand health-related SDGs. The SCORE for Health Data Technical Package (Survey, Count, Optimize, Review, Enable) identifies data gaps and provides\r\ncountries with tools to close them. Based on findings from the first assessment of country health data and information\r\nsystems, WHO is using an integrated approach to improve public health and disease surveillance, track civil registration\r\nand vital statistics (CRVS) data, and optimize routine health information systems, including regular and reliable data from\r\nhealth facilities. The following tools are available to countries: The World Health Survey Plus (WHS+) is a multi-topic, multi-mode, multi-platform survey tool to\r\ngather health data quickly in standardized and cost effective ways to assess and improve health. The CRVS strategic implementation plan is focused on supporting countries so that over the next five years there will\r\nbe substantial progress with accurate and timely tracking of births, deaths, and causes of death. WHO’s Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS) strategy aims to strengthen RHIS in countries through\r\nstrengthened partnerships, improved data collection, and improved integration and interoperability of RHIS, along\r\nwith building capacity and ensuring sustainability. The WHO Toolkit for Routine Health Information Systems Data strengthens facility data analysis through\r\nstandardized indicators, visualizations, and guidance, while promoting integrated routing data platforms. The WHO Harmonized Health Facility Assessment (HHFA) is a comprehensive facility survey providing data on the\r\navailability of health services and the resources and systems needed to improve quality. These data solutions enable public health decision makers to improve essential health services and better respond to\r\nemergencies."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "Why is WHO producing these estimates and what is the utility?", "answer": "WHO’s core normative function is to compile and disseminate statistics on mortality – numbers and causes. The world expects WHO to provide objective evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic supplements the traditional direct measure – mortality directly attributable to COVID-19 – with a broader measure showing the direct plus the indirect effects of the pandemic. It was important to start this work in the midst of the pandemic, rather than wait, in order to underpin the need for an equitable response during the pandemic by showing the real underlying impact of COVID-19 in different countries – especially lower and middle income countries that may not have developed health information systems to guide a targeted response. Deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 provide only a narrow perspective of the wide ranging harms being caused by the pandemic. The collateral damage from the COVID-19 pandemic is much wider. It was important to quantify this in the midst of the pandemic as it could inform choices that governments made regarding prioritization between routine and emergency health systems. The utility of the excess mortality estimates goes beyond estimation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It underlines the significance of investing in health and better targeting of interventions and resources to those most in need to prevent future deaths. These estimates will serve to underscore to governments around the world the need to sharpen their data tools and specifically improve civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), mortality surveillance, and data and health information systems. Estimates of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are also critical inputs for other important work currently underway, for example pandemic preparedness and estimating the global population. The UN is mandated to estimate the global population and prepare population projections. COVID-19 is a significant disruption to normal population growth trends and must be factored into any future estimates. Global excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provides a key input to this work, showing the effects of the pandemic on the global population now, but also the longer tail effects on future population projections. The importance of this should not be underestimated as population is one of the most important denominators for economic and social statistics."}
{"topic": "/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-the-COVID-19-pandemic", "question": "How is this work related to other global health and population estimates?", "answer": "The COVID-19 pandemic will have long lasting impacts on the structure of populations brought by changes in deaths and births. Substantial increases in mortality in many countries have affected premature mortality and life expectancy. WHO’s excess mortality estimates are critical inputs to WHO global health estimates and other UN partners’ work, including UN World Population Prospects. The excess mortality estimates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic provide a valuable set of comparable country estimates to better understand the impact of the pandemic. It is thus of vital importance that these estimates are made available in a timely manner and updated periodically to identify inequalities and gaps in health information systems and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), which in turn will help in determining likely future vulnerabilities and target interventions.

{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "Are the WHO 2006 child growth standards applicable to all children?", "answer": "The WHO 2006 child growth standards (0–5 years) describe normal child growth from birth to 5 years of age under optimal environmental conditions including WHO recommendations for breastfeeding. They can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding."}
{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "What growth references are recommended by WHO for children and adolescents older than 5 years?", "answer": "The WHO 2007 growth reference charts (5–19 years) are based on a re-analysis of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data from 1977. This reference complements the WHO child growth standards for 0–60 months published in April 2006. They are used for global monitoring and can be used also for national monitoring. Please see the WHO Reference 2007 for boys and girls, 5–19 years ."}
{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "Why were the WHO Child Growth Standards developed?", "answer": "The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference were used beginning in the 1970s. It describes how children grow in a particular region and time. This reference was based on data from several samples of children from a single country and suffers from a number of technical and biological drawbacks that make it inadequate to monitor the rapid and changing rate of early childhood growth. In 1993, under the leadership of WHO, the United Nations undertook a comprehensive review of the uses and interpretation of child growth references. The review concluded that it was time to develop new standards that show how children should grow in all countries rather than merely describing how they grew at a particular time and place. Following this review, in 1994, the World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed the development of a new set of tools to assess infant and young child growth. The Assembly stressed the need to move beyond past approaches and toward the more desirable goal of describing how all children should grow when their needs are met. In setting this ambitious goal, WHO and its principal partner, the United Nations University, in collaboration with a number of academic institutions worldwide, undertook the Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), a community-based, multi-country project to develop new growth standards for infants and young children. The study involved the recruitment of children who met a number of health criteria in 6 countries representing different regions of the world: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States of America. The 8440 children included in the study were raised in environments that minimized constraints to growth such as poor diets and infection. In addition, their mothers followed health practices such as breastfeeding their children and not smoking during and after pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "How different are the WHO Child Growth Standards from the old (NCHS/WHO) growth references?", "answer": "The WHO growth standards differ from any existing growth charts in a number of innovative ways. First, the MGRS was designed to provide data that describe how children should grow, by including in the study’s selection criteria specific health behaviours that are consistent with current health promotion recommendations (e.g., breastfeeding norms, standard pediatric care, non-smoking requirements). This approach is fundamentally different from that taken by the traditional descriptive references. By adopting a prescriptive approach, the protocol’s design went beyond an update of how children in presumably healthy populations grow at a specific time and place and explicitly recognize the need for standards (i.e., devices that enable value judgments by incorporating norms or targets in their construction). Arguably, the current obesity epidemic in many developed countries would have been detectable earlier if a prescriptive international standard had been available more than 30 years ago. Another key characteristic of the standards is that it makes breastfeeding the biological norm and establishes the breastfed infant as the normative growth model. The previous reference was based on the growth of artificially fed children. The pooled sample from the 6 participating countries will allow the development of a truly international standard (in contrast to the previous international reference based on children from a single country) and reiterate the fact that child populations grow similarly across the world’s major regions when their needs for health and care are met. These standards also include new innovative growth indicators beyond height and weight that are particularly useful for monitoring the increasing epidemic of childhood obesity, such as the skinfold thickness. The study’s longitudinal nature will also allow the development of growth velocity standards. Health-care providers will not have to wait until children cross an attained growth threshold to make the diagnosis of under-nutrition and overweight since velocity standards will enable the early identification of children in the process of becoming under- or over-nourished. Lastly, the development of accompanying windows of achievement for six key motor development milestones will provide a unique link between physical growth and motor development."}
{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "Do the WHO Child Growth Standards change the old NCHS estimates of overweight and undernutrition in children?", "answer": "Yes, estimates changed because of differences in the pattern of growth between the new standards and the old reference, especially during infancy. The magnitude of the change in the estimates however varied by age, sex, growth indicator, and the underlying nutritional status in the population being evaluated. A notable effect is that stunting (low height for age) was greater throughout childhood when assessed using the new WHO standards compared to the previous international reference. There was a substantial increase in underweight rates during the first half of infancy (i.e., 0–6 months) and a decrease thereafter. For wasting (low weight for length/height), the main difference between the new standards and the old reference is during infancy (i.e., up to about 70 cm length) when wasting rates will be substantially higher using the new WHO standards. With respect to overweight, use of the new WHO standards will result in a greater prevalence that will vary by age, sex and nutritional status of the index population."}
{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "What needs to be done so that all children grow well according to these standards?", "answer": "Breastfeeding should be supported, protected and promoted. For the first 6 months, mothers need to be informed and empowered to practice exclusive breastfeeding. Children should be provided safe, wholesome and nutritionally appropriate foods during the period of complementary feeding and after the second year when breastfeeding has ceased. Sound nutritional practices are important throughout childhood. Appropriate national guidelines should be developed to aid caregivers in choosing nutritious local foods incorrect combinations and amounts to feed their children in order to maintain optimal growth in later childhood (the aim being to avoid both nutritional deficiencies and excesses). Vaccinations and good health care should be available and accessible to all infants and young children. Families and their communities should do all they can to ensure that mothers have a good pregnancy. Nationally, full implementation of the objectives of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (2002) would go a long way in creating supportive environments for mothers to breastfeed their children. The standards can help stimulate change that facilitates these improvements. Therefore, the very first step should be implementing the new standard in every country and ensuring that every child has his/her own chart against which his/her growth is assessed followed by an appropriate follow-up."}
{"topic": "/child-growth-standards", "question": "Which cut-offs should we use for defining obesity risk in children?", "answer": "Given that children (0–5 years) are still growing and the lack of evidence on the functional significance of cut-offs for the upper end of the BMI-for-age distribution, WHO opted for a conversative approach when defining obesity risk. Thus, for 0–5 years of age, children above +1SD are described as being \"at risk of overweight\", above +2SD as overweight, and above +3SD as obese. A further reason for this cautiousness is to avoid the risk of people placing young growing children on restrictive diets. The WHO classifications for overweight/obesity in younger children (0–5 years) are defined in the training course on child growth assessment (Module C: Interpreting growth indicators available here ."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "What is chickenpox and what causes it?", "answer": "Chickenpox, also called varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This virus is a member of the herpesvirus family, and humans are the only known natural hosts for it. VZV is found worldwide. The initial infection with VZV results in chickenpox. After someone recovers from chickenpox, the virus becomes inactive in the nerve cells. It can reactivate later, leading to a painful condition known as shingles (herpes zoster). The virus spreads when someone with chickenpox coughs or sneezes, releasing infected droplets into the air, and through direct contact with the fluid from the chickenpox blisters. If a person is susceptible (meaning they haven't had chickenpox or been vaccinated), they are likely to contract the virus if exposed. Chickenpox tends to occur more often during winter and spring or cool and dry months, with outbreaks occurring every 2–5 years. While typically mild in children, it can be more severe in adults."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms?", "answer": "The most noticeable sign of chickenpox is an itchy rash that turns into small, fluid-filled blisters. This rash often starts on the scalp and face before spreading to the trunk and limbs. It can be preceded by a few days of fever, general discomfort (malaise) and loss of appetite. The rash develops over about five to seven days, progressing from flat spots (macules) to raised bumps (papules), then to itchy blisters (vesicles) and finally to scabs. Unvaccinated individuals typically develop around 300 lesions. These blisters eventually dry out, and crusts form and then disappear over one to two weeks. The time from exposure to the virus to the appearance of the rash (the incubation period) is usually 14–16 days, with a range of 10–21 days. The virus is contagious one to two days before the rash appears and until all the lesions are crusted over."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "How does chickenpox spread?", "answer": "Chickenpox is very contagious and spreads in several ways. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing droplets containing the virus. The virus can also spread through direct contact with the fluid from chickenpox blisters or respiratory secretions. A person is contagious from one to two days before the rash appears until all the blisters have formed scabs. This ease of transmission is why chickenpox can easily spread in places like schools and daycare centres. The secondary attack rate for chickenpox is high, with 61–100% of susceptible individuals contracting the disease after being exposed."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "What are the possible complications?", "answer": "While chickenpox is usually a mild illness, it can lead to complications, particularly in certain groups of people. These complications can include pneumonia (lung infection), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and bacterial infections of the skin. These complications can be severe and sometimes fatal. Although severe complications are more likely in individuals with weakened immune systems, most deaths from chickenpox occur in otherwise healthy children because the disease is so common. Those at higher risk for severe complications include infants under one year of age, pregnant women, adults and people with compromised immune systems."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "How long does chickenpox last from start to finish?", "answer": "The chickenpox rash typically appears within 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The rash takes about 5-7 days to fully develop from flat spots to blisters and then scabs. The scabs typically fall off within one to two weeks. Thus, the full course of chickenpox, from the first sign of the rash to the disappearance of scabs, can last approximately 2 to 4 weeks. Importantly, a person is contagious until all lesions have crusted over. Once the scabs have formed, the risk of transmitting the virus is greatly reduced."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "Can someone get chickenpox more than once in their lifetime?", "answer": "Usually, a person will only get chickenpox once in their life. After recovery, their body develops immunity to the virus. The virus then remains inactive in the nerve cells but may reactivate later in life to cause shingles. While it's rare, some people who have been vaccinated can develop a mild case of chickenpox known as \"breakthrough varicella\". This is usually less severe than the disease in unvaccinated individuals."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "How are chickenpox and shingles connected?", "answer": "Both chickenpox and shingles are caused by the same virus: the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). When a person is initially infected with VZV, they develop chickenpox. After the chickenpox infection has resolved, the virus remains inactive in nerve cells. Shingles occurs when this inactive virus reactivates, often later in life. Shingles appears as a painful rash, usually in a specific area of the body. Unlike chickenpox, shingles cannot be spread from person to person but can be transmitted to susceptible individuals who will then develop chickenpox. Shingles can sometimes lead to long-term nerve pain."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "How is chickenpox diagnosed?", "answer": "Doctors usually diagnose chickenpox based on the characteristic rash and symptoms. The rash usually starts on the face and trunk before spreading and is characterized by the appearance of new lesions over several days in the form of macules, papules, vesicles and scabs. In most cases, laboratory tests are not necessary. However, in some situations, such as when someone has been vaccinated or has a weakened immune system, lab tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis. These tests can include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the virus's DNA, direct antigen detection, or serological testing. PCR is considered the most reliable method for confirmation."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "What is the recommended treatment?", "answer": "For most healthy individuals, chickenpox is generally mild and doesn't require specific medical treatment. The focus is usually on relieving symptoms. This can include using calamine lotion or taking oatmeal baths to soothe the itching, and using acetaminophen (paracetamol) to reduce fever. Aspirin should not be used, especially in children, as it can cause Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition. Antiviral medications, like acyclovir, are generally not needed for healthy individuals, but they may be recommended for people at higher risk of complications, such as those who are immunocompromised or those with severe cases."}
{"topic": "/chickenpox", "question": "How can chickenpox be prevented?", "answer": "Chickenpox is a preventable disease. There are also several steps that can be taken to reduce the spread of the disease. These include avoiding contact with infected individuals, avoiding sharing personal items like towels and utensils, and practicing good hygiene. People with chickenpox should avoid leaving home until all their lesions have crusted and dried. Those with modified varicella (breakthrough cases) should isolate themselves until no new lesions appear for 24 hours. WHO recommends that the use of the recombinant herpes zoster vaccine in a 2-dose schedule with a minimum 2-month interval between doses, for the prevention of herpes zoster in older adults and those with chronic conditions, be considered in countries where herpes zoster is an important public health problem. WHO advised countries to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses to inform decision-making."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Is there a vaccine for mpox?", "answer": "Yes, there are vaccines available to help prevent and reduce the symptoms of mpox. There are some important differences between how these vaccines are given, and to whom they can be given. The available vaccines are: MVA-BN (also known as Imvamune®, Imvanex® or Jynneos®). This vaccine is given as an injection delivering the vaccine under the skin (subcutaneously). It can also be given between layers of the skin (intradermally), this technique allows a smaller dose (known as a fractional dose) to be given. LC16m8 (also known as LC16-KMB®). This vaccine involves lightly pricking the skin multiple times with a special bifurcated needle which helps deliver the vaccine just under the skin. MVA-BN and LC16m8 both contain a weakened form of a related virus called vaccinia virus to stimulate an immune response in the body. In addition, a vaccine known as ACAM2000 is currently licensed in the United States of America for prevention of mpox. Due to known side effects in some people, use of this vaccine is restricted."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Why is mpox vaccination important?", "answer": "Vaccination is important because it helps prevent infection and slow the spread of mpox between people. It also helps to protect people from severe illness. Mpox is mainly spread through close contact with a person who has mpox or contact with contaminated materials such as bedding, and in some places through contact with infected animals.  In areas where there is an outbreak, the main aim of mpox vaccination is to prevent transmission among people at risk of being exposed to mpox."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Who should get vaccinated against mpox?", "answer": "Mpox vaccination is recommended for people at risk of contracting mpox, especially during an outbreak. Whether or not vaccination is advised depends on an individual’s personal risk level and national and local health policies. This targeted approach prioritizes vaccination for the following people: People who have been in close contact with someone who has mpox (including children). People living in geographical areas with a high risk of exposure to mpox. Healthcare workers at risk of being exposed to mpox, including clinical laboratory and healthcare personnel performing tests to diagnose mpox. Mpox outbreak response team members. People who have multiple sex partners, including men who have sex with men. Sex workers of any gender and their clients. The risk of severe mpox disease and complications is greater for pregnant women, young children (especially those who are malnourished or affected by other illness), and immunocompromised persons (for example, persons with untreated or uncontrolled advanced HIV infection). In areas with community transmission of mpox, these groups may also be prioritized for vaccination. It is important to use the available stocks to protect the people who are most at risk. Mass vaccination (vaccination of a large number of people in a country or a region regardless of their level of risk) is not currently recommended."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "When should someone get vaccinated against mpox?", "answer": "Mpox vaccines can be given before or after exposure to the virus. Before exposure: to reduce the risk of becoming infected. After exposure: to reduce the risk of developing symptoms or severe disease. If you are in a group at risk for whom vaccination is recommended in your country, or were recently in close contact with someone who has mpox symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately for advice. Where possible, people who have been exposed to someone who has mpox should be vaccinated within four days of exposure, or within 14 days if no symptoms develop."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "How many doses of the vaccine will I need?", "answer": "The number of vaccine doses you need depends on which vaccine is available to you. MVA-BN vaccine. Typically, this vaccine is given as two full doses, 28 days apart. To offer vaccination to more people during an mpox outbreak, health authorities might decide to offer: -       two smaller \"fractional\" doses between layers of the skin, 28 days apart; or, -       one full dose under the skin. These vaccination schedules can help to ensure that vaccination can benefit as many people as possible. LC16m8 vaccine. This is a single dose vaccine, only one dose is needed for the body to develop protection. Booster doses are not currently recommended."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "How effective are the mpox vaccines?", "answer": "Available evidence shows that both MVA-BN and LC16m8 vaccines provide good protection for those fully vaccinated.  Latest studies show that people vaccinated with two doses of the MVA-BN vaccine have 82% less chance, and those vaccinated with one dose have 76% less chance, of getting mpox than those who did not get the vaccine. While some people may still develop mild mpox after vaccination, it will still give them protection against developing severe disease. You should continue to protect yourself wherever possible to reduce your risk of infection and to protect others, even after being vaccinated."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Do mpox vaccines cause side effects?", "answer": "Available evidence shows mpox vaccines are safe and well tolerated in most people.  As with any vaccine, some people may experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against mpox. This is a normal sign that the body is developing immunity. Common side effects can include pain, redness, swelling and itching at the injection site, muscle pain, headache, and fever. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, staying hydrated and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. In addition to the side effects above, the LC16m8 vaccine causes a “take” at the site of the injection.  This is a skin reaction which occurs within two weeks of vaccination and leaves a small scar. Reports of severe adverse events such as inflammation of the heart (called myocarditis or pericarditis) from these vaccines are very rare. Individuals should alert their local healthcare providers and seek urgent medical care following vaccination if they experience chest pain or other concerning symptoms."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Can I still get mpox after being vaccinated?", "answer": "It takes some time for immunity to develop after you have been vaccinated. How soon you develop maximum immunity depends on which vaccine you receive: MVA-BN vaccine: two weeks after your second dose. LC16m8 vaccine: within four weeks of a single dose. Continue taking precautions during this period to avoid mpox. This also helps to protect those around you. The protective behaviours are described here and include: Avoiding close contact with anyone who has mpox, including sexual contact. If possible, pausing sexual activity with multiple partners. Washing hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. Some people exposed to mpox may still develop mild symptoms even after having been vaccinated; in this case, the vaccine will still provide protection against more serious symptoms and complications. Continue to practice protective behaviours to reduce your risk of being exposed to mpox, even after being vaccinated."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Should I get vaccinated against mpox if I am travelling or have travelled to an area where there is an mpox outbreak?", "answer": "If you are travelling to a place where there is an mpox outbreak, make sure you take steps to avoid exposure to mpox. Vaccination against mpox is not routinely recommended when travelling to a country where there is an mpox outbreak, unless you are at risk of exposure to mpox. If you have been in close contact with someone who has mpox, contact your local healthcare provider for further guidance on vaccination."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Can I get vaccinated against mpox if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?", "answer": "The risk of developing severe mpox increases during pregnancy. The MVA-BN vaccine can be given to pregnant people at risk of exposure to mpox.  It can also be given to breastfeeding women. Breastfeeding offers substantial health benefits to breastfeeding women and their breastfed children. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination. The LC16m8 vaccine is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Can children be vaccinated against mpox?", "answer": "LC16m8 vaccine can be used for children from 1 year of age. MVA-BN vaccine is not currently licensed for use in children under 12 years of age, however, available data about children show it is safe. Based on existing safety data, WHO advised that MVA-BN may be used “off-label” for infants and children. This means the vaccine is recommended in emergency situations where the benefits of vaccination outweigh any potential risk. Its use must also be in alignment with national guidelines and approvals."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Can I get vaccinated against mpox if I am living with HIV infection?", "answer": "People living with HIV can be vaccinated and should be considered for vaccination as they may be at higher risk of mpox. Either MVA-BN or LC16m8 can be given to persons with treated and well-controlled HIV infection. Only MVA-BN can be given to people living with HIV who are currently immunocompromised (see below)."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Can I get vaccinated against mpox if I am immunocompromised?", "answer": "Immunocompromised people are at risk of developing more severe disease if they get mpox. People who are immunocompromised or who are on medical treatment that results in immune suppression can be vaccinated using the MVA-BN vaccine.  The LC16m8 vaccine should not be given to any person who is immunocompromised."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Why are smallpox vaccines being used for mpox?", "answer": "A weakened form of a virus called vaccinia is used in the smallpox and mpox vaccines. Vaccinia, smallpox and mpox are all from the same family of viruses. The weakened form of the vaccinia virus is safe to use in vaccines to prevent both mpox and smallpox."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Can I get vaccinated against mpox if I was vaccinated against smallpox in the past?", "answer": "If you are eligible for vaccination, you should go ahead and get vaccinated against mpox even if you have documentation proving previous smallpox vaccination or a visible smallpox vaccine scar."}
{"topic": "/mpox-vaccines", "question": "Some mpox vaccines (LC16m8 and ACAM2000) are delivered using a ‘bifurcated needle’. What does this mean?", "answer": "A bifurcated needle has two tips which your healthcare worker will use to prick the arm for the vaccine to enter your body. The bifurcated needle was designed in the 1960s and was successfully used to vaccinate many millions of people during the smallpox eradication campaign. In giving the vaccine with a bifurcated needle, a multiple puncture vaccination technique is used, and a small drop of blood appears at the vaccination site. After vaccination, a skin reaction (called a “take”) will appear at the place on the body where the injection is given and you will need to take care of the vaccination site. Follow instructions of your healthcare worker on how to do this."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What is Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe, often fatal illness caused by the Marburg virus. The virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever in humans characterized by fever, headache, back pain, muscle pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, confusion, diarrhoea, and bleeding at very late stages. MVD was first identified in Marburg, Germany in 1967. Since then, there have been a limited number of outbreaks reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa,  Uganda and Rwanda Recent outbreaks include in 2023, two separate MVD outbreaks in two countries, Equatorial Guinea and  Tanzania. Rwanda reported its first outbreak in 2024, while Tanzania declared another outbreak in January 2025. While rare, MVD remains a severe public health threat due to its high mortality rate and the lack of an effective antiviral treatment or vaccine.   While a range of vaccines and drug therapies are under development, early supportive care with rehydration, and symptomatic treatment improves people's chances of survival.

{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "How do people become infected with Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "People are initially infected with Marburg virus when they come in close contact with Rousettus bats, a type of fruit bat, that can carry the Marburg virus, and are often found in mines or caves. Between humans, the virus is mainly transmitted through contact with the body fluids of infected people. It can spread through direct contact with body fluids (blood, faeces, vomit, saliva, urine, sweat, breast milk, semen, pregnancy fluids) of infected people or people who died from the disease, or from contact with surfaces or materials contaminated with these body fluids. The disease does not spread through the air. The virus often spreads to a family member or a local health worker who has cared for someone ill or who has died from MVD without proper protective equipment. People remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. This means patients must continue treatment at a dedicated health facility and wait for the laboratory test to confirm when they may safely return home."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What are the typical signs and symptoms of Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "Early symptoms Early symptoms of MVD can arise quickly after infection and may include high fever, chills, severe headache and severe tiredness. Muscle aches and pains are also common early symptoms. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include nausea, vomiting, stomach and or chest pain, rash and diarrhoea which can last around a week. Late symptoms In later stages of the disease, bleeding from various sites such as the gums, nose and anus can occur. Patients can suffer shock, delirium and organ failure. The most reported MVD symptoms include: fever back pain muscle pain stomach-ache loss of appetite vomiting lethargy rash difficulty in swallowing headache diarrhoea hiccup difficulty breathing."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "How long does it take to develop symptoms of Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "The interval from infection to onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 21 days. Some patients will experience bleeding between 5 and 7 days, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. Blood in vomit and/or faeces is often accompanied by bleeding from the nose, gums, and vagina. Death can occur rapidly, and is usually caused by viral sepsis, multi-organ failure and bleeding."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "Is Marburg virus disease the same as Ebola virus disease?", "answer": "Marburg and Ebola diseases are both similar, rare diseases, although caused by different viruses. They are both members of the filovirus family and have the capacity to cause outbreaks with high fatality rates. Read more about EVD: Ebola Virus Disease It can be difficult to distinguish between MVD and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, malaria, typhoid fever and dengue fever due to the similarity of many symptoms. Only a test done in a laboratory, using blood, tissue, or other body fluid samples, can confirm the disease."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What should I do if I or a loved one develops symptoms associated with Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "If you or a loved one has MVD-like symptoms, reach out to a local health provider for up-to-date and accurate advice. If you or a loved one tests positive for MVD, early care at a designated treatment centre is essential and can improve the chance of survival. There is no specific treatment for MVD. However, to maximize the chances of recovery and for the safety of others, all patients should receive care and remain at a designated treatment centre until cleared to leave by the centre staff. You should not be treated at home. If you or a loved one tests negative for MVD but still has symptoms, remain vigilant until symptoms have disappeared and until you have been cleared by your health care provider. Follow your health care providers’ advice because further laboratory analysis may be required if you test negative for the Marburg virus but still have symptoms."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "How do I protect myself and others from MVD, when MVD is reported in our community?", "answer": "The best way to prevent MVD is to avoid contact with infected individuals or animals and to practice good hygiene and follow other preventive measures recommended by your local government or health authority. If you live in or are travelling to an area where MVD has been reported, even if you do not have symptoms and you are not a contact, follow all recommended local preventive measures such as: seeking care if you have MVD symptoms: washing your hands regularly with soap or with alcohol-based hand rub solution; avoiding contact with body fluids of people with MVD symptoms and the body of someone who died with symptoms of MVD; stopping at official check points and adhering to any preventive measures in place; agreeing to temperature screening; and completing health declaration forms when available at public entry points (e.g. hospitals, markets, churches, sports places, public offices, banks, airports, seaports and land borders)"}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What can I do if I have been in contact with someone with MVD?", "answer": "If you have been in contact with someone who has fallen ill with MVD or if you experience similar symptoms, you may be at risk of developing the disease, especially if you have been: in close contact with a MVD patient (while sick or dead) such as living or staying in the same household or room; admitted to a health facility where there was a MVD patient; and/or sharing objects or touching the same surfaces that may have been contaminated by body fluids of an MVD patient. Once you have been identified as a contact of someone with MVD symptoms, you will be monitored (as a contact) by the health authorities for 21 days after exposure. Health authorities will come to visit you twice a day to check on your health. If you have been identified as a contact: accept a visit by representatives of health authorities twice a day to monitor your health; provide them with accurate information, answering all questions as accurately as you can; avoid travelling unless travel has been approved by your local health authority; and report any symptoms immediately to your local health authority. If you have no symptoms 21 days after exposure, your health will no longer be monitored. If symptoms develop while being monitored by the health authorities, you will be advised to take a laboratory test. The test results will guide the health professional on whether you should immediately be admitted to a treatment centre or not for care."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What should I do if I must attend, or I have attended, a burial ceremony of someone confirmed or suspected to have died of Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "Bodies of people who have died from MVD must be handled only by people wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and must be buried immediately. Never wash, kiss or touch the body of someone who is confirmed or suspected of having died of MVD. If you are attending the burial, it is essential that you wash your hands with soap and water: before and after the burial; and before and after eating and after touching any surfaces in the area where the burial took place. Alcohol based hand rub solutions may be used if there is no visible soiling of hands (e.g. no blood or body fluids are visible on the hands). Any person showing symptoms of MVD before dying must be reported to local health authorities to assess and determine if a safe and dignified burial is required. Local health authorities should provide guidance on how to mourn the loss of loved ones in safe and dignified ways."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "Can Marburg virus disease be treated?", "answer": "There is currently no available treatment for MVD. This is why is it important for people showing Marburg-like symptoms to seek care early. Supportive care, including providing adequate hydration, pain management and treatment of symptoms as they arise under professional care remains the safest and most effective way to manage MVD. Treatment of co-infection such as malaria is also crucial for supportive care against MVD. Some candidate treatments have been prioritized by WHO for evaluation under randomized clinical trials.

{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What should I know about someone recovering from Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "When people recover from MVD, they need to be welcomed back into the community. To maintain the health and safety of survivors, they: will need regular medical checks and care for possible remaining adverse effects such as eye problems and, muscular pain will need love, inclusion and re-integration so that they do not feel excluded from the community. If you are a man recovering from MVD, you will be advised to observe safe sex practices, including consistent use of condoms, until semen has been tested twice as negative for MVD. If you are a woman breastfeeding while sick with MVD you may be advised to refrain from breastfeeding your baby, and, in that case, health authorities will support you with adequate milk replacement. After recovering, comply with testing to know when you can resume breastfeeding safely. If you are pregnant at the time of MVD infection and have recovered with a viable pregnancy, seek and accept dedicated supportive care until after your baby is born."}
{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "Is there a vaccine that protects against Marburg virus disease?", "answer": "There are no vaccines approved for MVD. However, there are some candidate vaccines currently under development. The World Health Organization has identified MVD as a top priority disease for which a vaccine is urgently needed.

{"topic": "/marburg-virus-disease", "question": "What should I know about animals and animal products during a Marburg virus disease outbreak?", "answer": "During MVD outbreaks, all animal products (blood and meat) should be safely managed, cleaned and cooked before consumption. It is important to correctly wash your hands before and after touching animals and related products. During field activities, work, research activities or tourist visits in mines, forests or caves inhabited by fruit bats, you should always wear long clothing, gloves and other appropriate protective coverings (including masks)."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "What is hMPV?", "answer": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is one of the viruses that causes the common cold (upper respiratory infection). It usually makes people only mildly sick, but it can make some people very sick. The virus belongs to the Pneumoviridae family of viruses, along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It was first identified in 2001 and has been spreading among people for many decades. It is found around the world. It spreads like other common cold viruses do, through infectious respiratory particles that spread through the air from a sick person to others. This means a person can catch the virus when they are close to a sick person or sharing a closed space with them. It can also enter the body by touching contaminated surfaces like doorknobs or handles and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "When does hMPV typically spread?", "answer": "Only a few countries monitor and report trends for hMPV, so we do not yet have a full understanding of how it spreads in all regions and climates. Studies show that in temperate regions, hMPV mainly spreads in late winter and spring, at the same time as other common respiratory viruses such as seasonal flu and RSV. However, it continues to spread at lower levels and makes some people sick all year around."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms of hMPV infection?", "answer": "Generally, people infected with hMPV will have cold or flu-like symptoms: cough fever sore throat runny or stuffy nose body ache headache. It can make a few people quite sick, causing infection of the lung (pneumonia) or inflammation of the airways to the lungs (bronchiolitis, bronchitis). Symptoms of more severe disease include wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, severe fatigue, dehydration, or a persistent fever that does not improve. If someone is experiencing any of these severe symptoms, they should seek medical advice."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "Who is at risk for hMPV infection?", "answer": "Human metapneumovirus is a common cause of upper respiratory infections among infants and children under 5 years old. While anyone can catch hMPV, infants, older adults, and those with health conditions like immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness. Extra care should be taken to protect at-risk groups and health care workers from any respiratory infections."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "How is hMPV infection prevented? Is there a vaccine?", "answer": "Preventing hMPV infection is similar to preventing other respiratory illnesses with actions such as: wearing a mask in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces improving ventilation where possible (such as by opening a window for air flow) cleaning hands regularly and thoroughly, with either soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning hands first. Having a strong immune system can also help fend off infections. Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and sleeping properly help with that. When someone is sick, they can avoid making others sick by staying at home if they feel ill covering nose and mouth with a tissue or bent elbow when coughing or sneezing wearing a mask when around other people improving ventilation, especially in shared spaces regularly cleaning hands and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. There is currently no vaccine licensed for use against hMPV, but research is ongoing."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "How is hMPV infection treated?", "answer": "As hMPV is a cold virus, people can treat their symptoms with over-the-counter medicines to treat pain, fever, stuffy nose and cough. Getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated also helps. Currently, there is no approved antiviral medicine for hMPV. Most people feel better in a few days. If symptoms get worse, they should contact their health care provider. Those who are at higher risk should also consult their doctor, even if their symptoms are not too bad. In a small number of cases, when people need to be hospitalized, doctors may give them extra oxygen to help them recover."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "Is there a test to diagnose hMPV infection?", "answer": "A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is the most reliable way to diagnose hMPV, giving accurate results within a few hours. However, doctors may not suggest this test for people with cold or flu-like symptoms as there is no specific treatment for hMPV infection and in most cases, it causes mild disease."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "How can you tell the difference between different respiratory diseases like COVID-19, flu, RSV and hMPV infections?", "answer": "It is hard to tell different respiratory illnesses apart as they have similar symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and congestion. However, the treatment can differ, especially for people who are or can become very sick. COVID-19 and Influenza have specific antiviral treatment options. Doctors may use diagnostic tests to identify the cause before deciding on the treatment."}
{"topic": "/human-metapneumovirus-(hmpv)-infection", "question": "How severe is hMPV infection compared to other respiratory illnesses?", "answer": "Human metapneumovirus usually causes cold or flu-like symptoms. However, how sick a person gets depends on many things, including their overall health. Also, since viruses can evolve, their severity may change. WHO works with global experts to monitor these changes."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "What is artemisinin and how is it used for the treatment of malaria?", "answer": "Isolated from the plant Artemisia annua , or sweet wormwood, artemisinin and its derivatives are powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium parasites in the blood of patients with malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO as the first- and second-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria as well as for chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria. ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin derivatives include artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin) with a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the first 3 days of treatment (reduction of parasite biomass), while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites (cure). WHO currently recommends 6 different ACTs (*). Two injectable treatments, artesunate or artemether, are recommended for the treatment of severe malaria and should be followed by an ACT when the patient can tolerate oral therapy. Increased access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has been integral to the remarkable success in reducing the global malaria burden over the last 15 years. Almost 4.5 billion treatment courses of prequalified ACTs were delivered globally by manufacturers between 2010 and 2023. An estimated 68% of these procurements were reported to have been distributed to the public sector in malaria endemic countries. * Artesunate-amodiaquine; artesunate-mefloquine; artesunate-pyronaridine; artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine; artemether-lumefantrine; dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "What is the definition of “artemisinin partial resistance”?", "answer": "Artemisinin partial resistance typically refers to a delay in the clearance of malaria parasites from the bloodstream following treatment with an ACT. As a result, the artemisinin compound is less effective in clearing all parasites within a 3-day period among patients who are infected with artemisinin partial resistant strains of malaria. Studies have demonstrated that the mechanisms of resistance developed by the parasites against artemisinin compounds affect only one stage of the malaria parasite cycle in humans: the ring stage. It is therefore more appropriate to call the delayed clearance “partial resistance” to highlight this time-limited and cycle-specific feature. It is unknown whether artemisinin partial resistance could further evolve to affect other stages of the parasites, developing into complete resistance. “Full” artemisinin resistance has not been reported. Currently, even if patients are infected with artemisinin partial resistant parasites, nearly all patients treated with an ACT are fully cured provided that the partner drug is highly efficacious in that geographical area. In the absence of partner drug resistance, artemisinin partial resistance rarely leads to treatment failure. Furthermore, there is no evidence that artemisinin partial resistance alone has resulted in an increase in malaria morbidity and mortality in the areas where it has been detected."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "What are the current molecular markers of artemisinin partial resistance?", "answer": "Artemisinin partial resistance is seen as delayed parasites clearance after treatment with a drug containing artemisinin. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that mutations in the PfKelch13 BTB/POZ and propeller domain ( PfK13 ) are associated with this delayed parasite clearance. To date, more than 260 non-synonymous PfK13 mutations have been reported. However, not all the non-synonymous PfK13 mutants reported are associated with artemisinin partial resistance; mutants can also represent genotypes arising de novo but not being selected for. Different PfK13 mutations have varying effects on the clearance phenotype. WHO has established a list of candidates or associated and validated markers of artemisinin partial resistance. The criteria for classification of PfK13 markers of artemisinin partial resistance are shown in the box below. Candidate or associated PfK13 markers of artemisinin partial resistance A statistically significant association (p <0.05) between a PfK13 mutation and clearance half-life >5 hours or day 3 parasitaemia via a chi-squared test or appropriate multivariable regression model on a sample of at least 20 clinical cases OR Survival of >1% using the RSA 0–3h in at least five individual isolates with a given mutation or a statistically significant difference (p <0.05) in the RSA 0–3h assay between culture-adapted recombinant isogenic parasite lines, produced using transfection and gene editing techniques, which express a variant allele of PfK13 as compared with the wild-type allele Validated PfK13 markers of artemisinin partial resistance Both requirements 1 and 2 are met The list of validated and candidate markers is continually being updated. The current list is provided below; all are located in the PfK13 BTB/POZ and propeller domain. Outside these domains, 2 mutations were reported frequently in clinical studies: K189T and E252Q. E252Q has been associated with delayed clearance, but in vitro this association appears to be dependent on other mutations. The mutation A578S has been identified in several studies in Asia and Africa but has not been associated with clinical or in vitro resistance to artemisinin.

{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "What is the state of partial artemisinin resistance around the world?", "answer": "Clear evidence of parasites partially resistant to artemisinin has now been identified in the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) and Africa – specifically in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. In late 2013, researchers identified a new molecular marker: mutations in the PfKelch13 (K13) propeller domain were shown to be associated with delayed parasite clearance in vitro and in vivo following treatments with artemisinins. The molecular marker allows for a more precise mapping and monitoring of the geographical distribution of artemisinin partial resistance. Artemisinin partial resistance likely first emerged in the GMS prior to 2001, and prior to the widespread deployment of ACTs. Molecular surveys have shown that artemisinin partial resistance has emerged independently in several locations within the GMS. In Africa, artemisinin partial resistance has been confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda,Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. These parasites have emerged independently and have not spread from South-East Asia. Based on available evidence, such resistance is also suspected in Ethiopia, Namibia, Sudan and Zambia."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "What is the current state of ACT failures around the world?", "answer": "The efficacy of WHO-recommended ACTs is assessed through therapeutic efficacy studies (TES). Such studies done at regular intervals at the same sites allow for the early detection of declines in drug efficacy, providing evidence for guiding national malaria treatment policies. While artemisinin partial resistance alone rarely leads to treatment failure, in the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) there is also resistance to a number of the ACT partner drugs. As a consequence, several ACTs are failing in the GMS. Managing the drug resistance situation requires close monitoring but there are still ACTs available, capable of treating patients even in the areas where the drug resistance is worst. In Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, where artemisinin partial resistance has been confirmed, therapeutic efficacy studies are being done to ensure that the ACTs which are recommended in the national treatment policy continue to be efficacious.  In other areas of Africa, a few TES studies have reported treatment failures from studies with artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. WHO is working with countries and partners to investigate if these failures are linked to ACT partner drug resistance."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "How is WHO supporting countries in the Greater Mekong subregion tackle multidrug resistance?", "answer": "In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), the response to resistance has included improved monitoring of efficacy and resistance and pursuit of malaria elimination. In collaboration with national malaria programmes and partners, WHO led the development of the Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong subregion (2015–2030) . With technical guidance from WHO, all GMS countries have developed national malaria elimination plans that are aligned with the subregional strategy. As countries implement these plans, WHO is providing ongoing technical support through its 5 GMS country offices, regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, and the Organization’s headquarters in Geneva . Furthermore, in 2017, WHO launched the Mekong Malaria Elimination (MME) programme . The MME subregional team in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, supports the malaria elimination strategy by facilitating coordination and dialogue among partners, communicating with external stakeholders, and coordinating cross-border initiatives. Impressive progress has been made towards eliminating P. falciparum from the GMS."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "How is WHO responding to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa?", "answer": "The emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa necessitates a response aiming to ensure that efficacious treatments remain available. An immediate priority is to provide support to improve the phenotypic and genotypic surveillance to better map the extent of the resistance. Plans are being developed to help countries address issues that could cause resistance to spread. Artemisinin partial resistance has likely occurred as a consequence of several factors: poor treatment practices, inadequate patient adherence to prescribed antimalarial regimens, and the widespread availability of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard forms of the drug. Scaling up interventions will require considerable financial resources, long-term political commitment, and strong cross-border cooperation. One of the most urgent challenges is to strengthen pharmaceutical market regulation and remove oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard medicines from markets. In November 2022, WHO launch a new Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa . The strategy aims to tackle drug resistance through, among other actions, tracking its spread, identifying the populations most at risk, and developing viable alternative treatments. ACTs remains the best available treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, and it is imperative that the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance does not lead health care providers or patients to hesitate to prescribe and use ACTs to treat confirmed malaria ."}
{"topic": "/artemisinin-resistance", "question": "Who is funding these efforts?", "answer": "The fight to eliminate malaria in the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) is supported through generous contributions from a number of donors, including: the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund); the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office of the UK Government; and the US Agency for International Development. In response to the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in the GMS, the Global Fund launched the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI) in 2013. Funding provided through this initiative has enabled countries to purchase and distribute commodities such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), rapid diagnostic tests and quality-assured drugs. In 2020, the Global Fund announced an expansion of the RAI (RAI3E), committing an additional US$ 228.3 million for the period 2021 to 2023. WHO is in discussions with donors to scale up efforts in areas in Africa affected by resistance."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "What are neglected tropical diseases?", "answer": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of conditions 1 caused by a variety of pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and toxins) and associated with devastating health, social and economic consequences. NTDs are mainly prevalent among impoverished communities in tropical areas, although some have a much larger geographical distribution. It is estimated that NTDs affect more than 1 billion people, while the number of people requiring NTD interventions (both preventive and curative) is 1.5 billion. The epidemiology of NTDs is complex and often related to environmental conditions. Many of them are vector-borne, have animal reservoirs and are associated with complex life cycles. All these factors make their public health control challenging. --------------------------------------------- 1 NTDs include: Buruli ulcer; Chagas disease; dengue and chikungunya; dracunculiasis; echinococcosis; foodborne trematodiases; human African trypanosomiasis; leishmaniasis; leprosy; lymphatic filariasis; mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses; noma; onchocerciasis; rabies; scabies and other ectoparasitoses; schistosomiasis; soil-transmitted helminthiases; snakebite envenoming; taeniasis/cysticercosis; trachoma; and yaws."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "Why are they called ‘neglected’?", "answer": "They are ‘neglected’ because they are almost absent from the global health agenda. Even today, when the focus is on universal health coverage, NTDs have very limited resources and are almost ignored by global funding agencies. NTDs are diseases of neglected populations that perpetuate a cycle of poor educational outcomes and limited professional opportunities; in addition, they are associated with stigma and social exclusion."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "Where are NTDs most prevalent?", "answer": "NTDs flourish mainly in rural areas, in conflict zones and hard-to-reach regions. They thrive in areas worsened by climate change and where access to clean water and sanitation is scarce. Furthermore, NTDs tend to affect regions without quality health care, leaving poor populations vulnerable to these often debilitating diseases and newly emerging threats."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "How can we tackle NTDs?", "answer": "WHO recommends five core strategic interventions to accelerate the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs): innovative and intensified disease management preventive chemotherapy vector control veterinary public health provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene. Experience has demonstrated that while one intervention may predominate for the control of one specific disease or disease groups, a more effective impact on both morbidity and transmission results when all required interventions are combined and delivered simultaneously. Recently, WHO has focused its attention on specific challenges that need to be addressed to achieve the targets set for 2030. These include assessing the impact of climate change on the epidemiology of NTDs and adapting disease control interventions accordingly; identifying those key gaps in research and development (R&D) that limit efficacy and effectiveness of action against NTDs, through the preparation of an R&D blueprint for neglected tropical diseases ; reinforcing supply chain mechanisms to enable timely delivery of NTD medicines and health products to those in need as well as sound accountability at every step and all levels; and strengthening systems for data collection, analysis and dissemination so as to be able to track progress towards milestones and targets set for each NTD."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "How are NTDs related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)?", "answer": "NTDs have the greatest relevance for SDG 3 (the health goal). Interventions against NTDs directly contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.3: “end the epidemics of...neglected tropical diseases”, while their impact is measured by SDG indicator 3.3.5: “number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases”. NTD activities also contribute indirectly to many other SDGs (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 17), while progress towards some SDGs (6, 9, 11, 13) is critical to tackle NTDs."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "What concrete steps is WHO taking against NTDs?", "answer": "Despite the difficulties inherent in their public health control, WHO envisages ambitious targets for NTDs, including control, elimination as a public health problem, elimination of transmission and global eradication. Over the past decade, WHO has progressively harmonized public health approaches against NTDs around three main concepts: integration, person-centred care and cross-sectoral collaboration. Disease control efforts have been progressively integrated in endemic areas. Countries are moving away from vertical, disease-specific programmes and strengthening crosscutting interventions that are best poised to impact on diseases that often overlap geographically and affect the same population groups, in line with WHO’s multi-disease elimination initiative. Examples include preventive chemotherapy and the skin-NTD framework . Action has also been taken to promote person-centred care, not just by treating infections, but by addressing the longer-term burden of morbidity and disability, and by tackling conditions often associated with NTDs, such as those related to mental health, stigma and social exclusion . Cross-sectoral collaboration aims at mobilizing all actors beyond the health sector to maximize the impact of interventions against neglected tropical diseases. Notably the education, environment and veterinary sectors play critical roles in the prevention, treatment and care of neglected tropical diseases and in the implementation of NTD interventions. Examples include the school-based distribution of anthelmintic medicines, platforms tackling vector-borne diseases such as the Global Arbovirus Initiative , and the One Health approach ."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "How has WHO’s global action against NTDs evolved?", "answer": "WHO has supported the global community by developing a comprehensive set of normative guidance to support the planning, financing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NTD interventions, from the global to the community level. World Health Assembly resolution 66.12 (2013) reflects the commitment of WHO’s Member States to address the burden of NTDs through integrated, cohesive approaches. While the first NTD road map (2012–2020) delineated milestones and targets, the second roadmap (2021–2030) sets out key actions and programmatic shifts to drive progress towards a world free of NTDs by 2030. In 2023, WHO scaled up its advocacy work by convening the Global meeting on skin-related neglected tropical diseases (27−31 March) and the Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Programme partners’ meeting (12−13 June). Over the years, WHO has also facilitated or joined global initiatives such as the Kigali declaration on neglected tropical diseases and the Abu Dhabi declaration on the eradication of Guinea worm disease ."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "Does addressing NTDs contribute to promote global health equity?", "answer": "The notion of equity is woven into the fabric of the global NTD agenda. NTD programmes mostly serve marginalized communities and prioritize the needs of the most disadvantaged population groups. NTD programmes are closely aligned with SDG targets and contribute to achieving several of them. NTD interventions are often delivered through a primary health care approach, may represent the most advanced point of contact between remote communities and national health services, and are considered important steps on the path towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "What progress has been achieved over the past years?", "answer": "Much progress has been made over the past decade. The population requiring NTD interventions decreased by 31% between 2010 and 2023, from 2.19 to less than 1.5 billion. As of end 2024, 54 countries have eliminated at least one NTD, with several countries being acknowledged by WHO for eliminating 2, 3 or 4 conditions. In total, 75 acknowledgement processes have been successfully completed. Hundreds of millions of people at risk of NTDs are treated and provided care every year."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "Has the COVID-19 pandemic affected NTD programmes?", "answer": "NTD programmes have been among the most frequently and severely affected by the pandemic across health systems. Many countries had to delay community-based interventions such as preventive chemotherapy or active case-finding, while access to health-facility services dropped because of movement restrictions for both health staff and patients. For example, in 2020, the number of people reached by mass treatment interventions dropped to 762 million from 1.164 billion in 2019. Although a resumption of activities has occurred from 2021 onwards, the observed recovery is still partial and far from pre-COVID-19 levels. In 2023, people treated were 857 million. In 2020−2022, the need to address the COVID-19 emergency determined a reprioritization of resources to other areas, in cash and kind. Production and supply lines for medicines and diagnostics were repurposed to support the need for products in high demand during the pandemic, and shipment of commodities to countries was severely disrupted. Financial support to NTD programmes was also affected at all levels, from global to local, jeopardizing job security and activities. While it would have been expected that the progressive decrease of the public health relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic would witness a return to normality, this has not been the case."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "How can we make NTD programmes more sustainable?", "answer": "Many national NTD programmes are largely reliant on donor funding, so that NTDs are often not included in established national policy, financial and coordination processes. While this model has driven significant progress, as we move forward it is imperative that these investments are complemented with more sustainable approaches and a stronger country ownership. There is a need to increase the sustainability and predictability of funding, the availability of medicines and diagnostics across the whole NTD spectrum, and the mainstreaming of NTD programmes and services within national health systems. In this way, we can maximize the contribution of NTD interventions to each of the three dimensions of universal health coverage (who is covered, which services are covered, and the proportion of the costs covered). How can we do that? A sustainability framework and an investment rationale , complementing the road map, highlight the need to support cost-efficient interventions. They challenge the global community to invest in cross-cutting interventions outside of the health sector, in areas including water, sanitation and hygiene; education; agriculture; animal welfare; and finance. All these sectors impact the lives of those living in areas endemic for NTDs and are important as part of a holistic, sustainable approach. Ultimately, NTD interventions need to be a routine part of national systems and services to preserve the progress made, continue protecting those benefiting from services, and expand services where needed."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "WHO’s road map: can it end the suffering from NTDs by 2030?", "answer": "The NTD road map 2021−2030 aims to leave no one behind. It moves from vertical disease programmes to cross-cutting approaches, through smarter investments to improve health and well-being by 2030. It works to reduce poverty by addressing the burden of disease due to NTDs and aims to support the achievement of universal health coverage (UHC) and poverty reduction. The road map fosters innovation in critical area such as diagnostics, and provides opportunities to evaluate, assess and adjust programmatic actions as and when needed over the next decade by setting overarching, crosscutting and disease-specific targets and milestones. Another distinct feature is to drive greater ownership by national and local governments, including communities. The overarching 2030 global targets are: reduce by 90% the number of people requiring treatment for NTDs reduce by 75% the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to NTD eliminate at least one NTD from 100 countries eradicate two diseases (dracunculiasis and yaws) globally."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases", "question": "Will 2030 really signal the end of suffering from NTDs?", "answer": "WHO is optimistic, although significant challenges remain. Some of these can include consequences arising from climate change, conflict, emerging zoonotic and environmental health threats, as well as continued socio-economic inequalities that have a direct impact on access to health-care services, adequate housing, safe water and sanitation. Disruption to health services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has added a further burden. Nevertheless, the WHO road map offers all the tools required to overcome these and any future challenges. It is built on delivering health services in an integrated, cross-sectoral manner, it moves away from the vertical, disease-centred approach to being people-focused, and is adaptable to different contexts and scenarios."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "Should we be concerned about mpox in schools?", "answer": "When mpox is spreading in a community, learners, students and educational staff can be affected. Mpox spreads through close contact, making people who spend time in places where there are close interactions , such as schools, potentially more vulnerable. In schools, the spread of mpox can be reduced or prevented by putting in place measures such as handwashing, cough etiquette and surface cleaning, and raising awareness through communication."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "What can local health administrators and educational authorities do to prepare for a potential mpox outbreak in their community?", "answer": "It is critical to work together to safeguard students’ routines and learning, their development and overall well-being. Schools and learning spaces should remain open, and relevant measures to decrease exposure to the virus and reduce the risk of transmission should be strengthened. The following key actions can ensure readiness as well as an agile response to the spread of mpox. Co-create a plan, messages, information, and education and communication materials with teachers, staff, caregivers and students about the need to implement preventive measures in schools and learning spaces. Develop a plan about how to respond when a student, teacher or staff member is thought to have mpox or is identified by health authorities as a possible or confirmed case or a close contact of a case. Ensure that schools and learning spaces have access to age-appropriate information and visual communication tools about mpox, including information about: how mpox spreads; its signs and symptoms; the importance of prevention and control measures; procedures for contacting local public health authorities to support the care of a student or staff member who may have mpox in a discreet and respectful manner; and how to prevent stigma and discrimination. Reinforce infection prevention and control measures, including, but not limited to, the need for frequent hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (i.e. covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow), and cleaning of classrooms and shared spaces. Prepare to scale up and enhance measures when mpox transmission is likely or taking place in a school setting. For more information, refer to “ Field guide: the three star approach for WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) in schools ”. Ensure that personal protective equipment, such as gloves, and cleaning materials, including chlorine solution, are in place and available in sufficient quantities. Identify in advance a space that can be used for temporary isolation, ideally a space with good ventilation, and develop and communicate the protocol for helping a person who may have mpox. Be prepared to introduce resources and mechanisms to allow students to continue to learn remotely or through self-paced learning while they are in isolation for mpox. Train teachers, educational staff and student representatives to identify early symptoms and assess ill students. Provide basic training in mental health and psychosocial support skills, and how to use these skills in schools and learning spaces. Build on existing hygiene promotion programmes in schools to co-create with students some messages, information, education and communication materials, and other school activities to promote hygiene and other protective measures at school and at home. Promote an open and transparent discussion within the school community to create trust, reduce alarm and prevent potential stigma and discrimination. Organize regular dialogues within the school community to promote prevention measures and to address doubts, concerns and rumours."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "What can students, teachers and staff do to protect themselves from mpox at school and in the community?", "answer": "To protect themselves, students, staff, and teachers should: Know the symptoms of mpox, how it is spread and how to regularly check for signs and symptoms. Stay home when sick, especially when showing signs and symptoms of mpox. Seek guidance from local health authorities (e.g. health and care workers, public health officers or community health workers) and isolate, even when symptoms are mild. Avoid close contact with someone who has signs and symptoms of mpox. Practise frequent hand hygiene, using clean water and soap or an alcohol-based hand rub, especially before eating, after touching broken skin or coming into contact with body fluids, and when hands are dirty. Safely handle clothes, uniforms and other linens, such as sheets or towels. If symptoms develop when a student, teacher or staff member is not at school, they should stay home and they or the school can contact a health care provider or local health authorities, who can guide care and testing, further isolation measures and contact tracing, if necessary. Students, teachers and staff should know which practices or protocols have been agreed to, and follow the guidance if they develop symptoms while at school. Stigma can prevent school and community members from seeking care or sharing information. Use respectful language and treat colleagues affected by mpox with compassion and support, rather than judgment."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "How can school administrators and educational authorities manage the risk of mpox in schools and learning spaces?", "answer": "It is important to review and adapt measures as an outbreak evolves. Regularly assess the effectiveness of implemented measures and make necessary adjustments based on feedback and public health guidance. Consider gathering input and feedback from students, parents and staff to identify challenges to and areas for improvement in implementing measures; and update guidance and protocols as new information becomes available or as the outbreak situation changes. A full range of measures listed below can be considered depending on local risks, feasibility, and contextual factors. Promoting personal hygiene Ensure there are functional handwashing stations that have soap and clean water (or an alcohol-based hand rub), and encourage frequent handwashing, especially after using the toilet, after coughing or sneezing, before eating, after touching broken skin or coming into contact with body fluids, and when hands are visibly dirty. Promote respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette: cover coughs and sneezes, turn away from others and cover the mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow, and properly dispose of waste, such as tissues. Minimize physical contact between people and the sharing of materials and personal items whenever possible. Students and staff should be encouraged to bring their own utensils and reusable drinking bottles whenever possible. Ensure there are adequate spaces and facilities for students – such as those in boarding schools or physical education classes – and guidance about how to safely handle their own clothes, uniforms and other linens, such as sheets and towels. Implementing surface cleaning Ensure that frequently touched surfaces and objects are cleaned and disinfected regularly (e.g. desks, chairs, doors, handles, sports equipment), particularly those in shared spaces (e.g. classrooms, bathrooms, cafeterias and other common areas). Keep classrooms and school spaces well ventilated. Targeting the animal-human interface In places where trapped or hunted animals may carry the virus that causes mpox, ensure that meat is carefully handled and thoroughly cooked before consumption. Prevent live wild animals from entering school property. Avoid dead animals and those that are ill. Wash hands after touching any animals. Raising awareness Clear, fact-based messages and materials that communicate the risks and increase awareness of mpox should be readily available to the school community. They should be delivered through multiple channels, in various forms and formats, while ensuring that they are accessible to people with different literacy levels. School administrators, teachers and staff can consider the following actions. Provide regular updates to students and staff, especially when new information becomes available or if the risk of infection changes. Promote regular dialogue within the school community to encourage the adoption of preventive measures and to dispel doubts, concerns and rumours. Proactively address any possible stigma or discrimination associated with mpox infection, including when staff or students who had mpox return to school. Regularly monitor information circulating in the community to promptly address any misinformation (see WHO’s course on infodemic management ) and to prevent confusion and fear within the school community. If feasible, collaborate with health and care workers and community health workers to support these risk communication and community engagement efforts. For more information refer to the WHO publication “ Interim public health advice for mpox-related prevention and control measures in school settings ”."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "What should students, teachers and staff do if they have been exposed to someone suspected or confirmed to have mpox?", "answer": "If a student, teacher or staff member has come into contact with someone who has mpox, they should monitor themself for signs and symptoms of the illness for 21 days after exposure. As long as they remain symptom-free, they may continue their daily activities and continue to attend school or go to work. If symptoms develop, they should stay home and isolate, and the school should contact local health authorities for advice. During the 21-day monitoring period, the contact should: rigorously practice hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette; limit their sharing of personal items, such as eating utensils, school supplies and personal hygiene products; receive information about what to do if symptoms appear and closely monitor their symptoms daily; have access to age-appropriate information; have their concerns addressed by designated resource persons; and refrain from sexual contact."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "What should be done when a student, teacher or staff member has or may have mpox?", "answer": "If a student, teacher, or staff member has or may have mpox, do the following: Isolation The school should contact health authorities when someone becomes ill so the health care authorities can assess the situation and, if necessary, coordinate the care, testing and safe transport of the affected person from the school or learning space. If a student or learner becomes ill , their parent or guardian should be notified and should be able to communicate with their child if the parent or guardian is not the person taking them to the facility. In addition, parents and guardians should be put in touch with a health care provider or local health authorities to receive all necessary information and to address any concerns. If local health authorities are not available to assist with safe transport, parents or guardians should be advised to take the child to a nearby health facility for assessment and instructed about how to prevent transmission during transport. If a staff member becomes ill , discreetly ask them to move to the previously identified space and to contact a health care provider or local health authorities about how to safely access care. Health authorities can also advise about further isolation measures for the person who is ill, either at home or in a health care facility, in line with clinical need and local procedures, and perform contact tracing as required. Surface cleaning Strengthen the following cleaning practices. Ensure that cleaners wear gloves, a medical mask and close-toed shoes used only for cleaning. Cleaners should avoid dry sweeping or vacuuming to prevent the dispersion of particles; instead damp mopping or wiping should be used. If the affected individual has been to multiple classrooms or other spaces on campus, all of those spaces must be cleaned thoroughly. Surfaces must be washed with soapy water and then disinfected with a minimum 0.05% chlorine solution. The surface should remain damp from the chlorine solution for at least 1 minute for proper disinfection to occur. Cleaners should wear gloves to place any waste generated by the student or staff member into waste bags, tie them securely and dispose of them with other municipal waste. Gloves should be carefully removed and disposed of in a waste bin. Immediately after they finish, cleaners should wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based sanitizer. Home care and isolation For information about home care and isolation, refer to WHO and UNICEF’s interim operational guidance on home care and isolation ."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "How can we support continuity of learning for students who are isolating due to mpox?", "answer": "To ensure continual learning for students or learners in isolation, the school or learning space should maintain communication with the student or learner and organize distance learning. If distance learning is not feasible due to limitations in infrastructure and resources, the school might consider arranging catch-up or remedial sessions after the student or learner has recovered."}
{"topic": "/mpox--preventing-and-managing-mpox-in-schools-and-learning-spaces", "question": "How can we support the mental health of students, teachers, and staff during an mpox outbreak?", "answer": "Outbreaks of mpox can create fear of the disease and of the stigma, uncertainty and suffering that can affect everyone in the school community. These challenges can interfere with children’s routines and learning, negatively affecting their development and overall well-being. In addition to preserving access to learning, schools can serve as vital platforms for delivering accurate, age-appropriate information about an outbreak. By providing guidance on protective measures, schools can empower students to take an active role in protecting their own health and the health of their peers. Schools can also foster a culture of care and support. To ensure that students or learners are willing to look after each other´s mental health and psychosocial well-being during times of crisis, schools and learning spaces can consider taking the following actions. Provide mental health and psychosocial support for children . For example, this can be achieved by creating safe opportunities for students to share their feelings and by incorporating stress-reduction activities into the classroom or learning space. Train and support educational personnel. Training teachers and educational personnel in basic psychosocial support skills (e.g. how to recognize and respond to stress responses, how to promote social support) allows them to help children in distress and learn more about self-care. Training should also be provided in how to offer age-appropriate information about mpox prevention and control, and positive coping strategies for addressing stigma, as well as how to promote learning by, and the well-being of, children during times of crisis. There are established recommendations for minimum training in basic psychosocial support skills . Support the mental health and psychosocial well-being of educational personnel. For example, this can be achieved by establishing peer-to-peer support groups or check-ins that gauge a teacher’s or staff member’s emotional well-being and need for additional support. Review and update referral protocols. Regularly review and update referral pathways to connect students with essential services when needed, including health, mental health, and child protection services. For more information, please refer to UNICEF’s guidance on integrating mental health and psychosocial support into mpox response and on priorities and activities for mental health and psychosocial support during an mpox outbreak."}
{"topic": "/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework", "question": "What is the PIP Framework?", "answer": "The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework , or PIP Framework, is an innovative access and benefit sharing instrument that seeks to better prepare the world to respond more equitably to the next influenza pandemic. The PIP Framework was adopted on 24 May 2011 by the 194 Member States of WHO, recognizing that an influenza pandemic would be a global challenge, and preparing for it requires a holistic, collective and cooperative approach. WHO implements the PIP Framework in close partnership with Member States, public health laboratories that are specialized in influenza, industry and civil society."}
{"topic": "/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework", "question": "What are the objectives of the PIP Framework?", "answer": "The PIP Framework has two objectives that are equally important: sharing by WHO Member States of influenza viruses with human pandemic potential      with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS); and equitable access to vaccines, medicines and other products and technologies. Under the Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential (IVPPs) in a rapid, systematic and timely manner with GISRS, a WHO coordinated global network of public health laboratories. In addition to serving as a virus sharing platform, GISRS also develops – inter alia – candidate vaccine viruses, and other analyses, materials and information that are shared with Member States and manufacturers of influenza vaccines and other products, such as antivirals and diagnostics. The PIP Framework establishes two key benefit sharing mechanisms to strengthen pandemic influenza preparedness and ensure a more equitable response to the next influenza pandemic: advance supply agreements (known as a Standard Material Transfer Agreement 2, or SMTA2) to ensure that WHO will have access, in real time, to specific percentages of pandemic influenza vaccines, antivirals, and diagnostics, at the time of the next influenza pandemic; and an annual partnership contribution that ensures that WHO has funds to strengthen pandemic influenza preparedness and response capacities in countries where these are weak."}
{"topic": "/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework", "question": "Which influenza viruses does the PIP Framework cover?", "answer": "The PIP Framework only applies to influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, including H5N1. It does not apply to seasonal influenza viruses."}
{"topic": "/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework", "question": "How is the annual partnership contribution used?", "answer": "The partnership contribution funds (currently US$ 28 million per annum) are paid to WHO by influenza vaccine, antiviral and diagnostic manufacturers that use the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. The majority of funds are used to support multi-year, pandemic influenza preparedness and capacity strengthening projects in countries where such capacities are weak. A small percentage of funds received is set aside for response activities when the next influenza pandemic emerges, and a smaller portion of funds supports the costs to implement the Framework, including the work to conclude advance supply agreements, and convene the meetings of the PIP Advisory Group. Use of the preparedness funds is guided by the High-Level Implementation Plan III 2024-2030 (HLIP III) , which covers four key areas of work: policy and plans collaborative disease      surveillance through GISRS community protection access to pandemic influenza countermeasures      such as vaccines and antivirals. Use of the PIP partnership contribution response funds at the time of an influenza pandemic will be guided by the Guiding Principles for use of PIP Framework Partnership Contribution Funds for Pandemic Influenza Response . The PIP Framework operates on a biennial basis and publishes four progress reports per biennium (at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). The reports present overall progress against milestones and indicators that help measure achievements against defined objectives and goals. The reports include infographics and stories from the field and cover technical and financial implementation. All reports can be found on the Partnership Contribution website ."}
{"topic": "/influenza-pandemic-influenza-preparedness-framework", "question": "What are Standard Material Transfer Agreements 2?", "answer": "A Standard Material Transfer Agreement 2 (SMTA2) (as distinguished from SMTA1, which governs the interactions among GISRS laboratories) is a legally binding advance supply contract between WHO and an entity that has received PIP biological materials from GISRS. Under an SMTA2, an entity commits to providing specific benefits to WHO, based on the nature of its work and its capacities. These benefits include pandemic influenza vaccines, antiviral medicines or other pandemic-related products or technologies. The agreements for vaccines and antivirals specify the percent of future production that is to be provided to WHO when it is produced, at the time of the next pandemic. With SMTA2s, WHO and its partners ensure that countries without access to life-saving vaccines, antivirals and other products will have access to some of the supplies they need at the same time as other countries.

{"topic": "/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants", "question": "What are SLCPs?", "answer": "Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), found in ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution , produce strong climate change effects but only remain in the atmosphere briefly, from a few days to about a decade. The short life span of SLCPs means that assertive action now to reduce emissions can rapidly improve both air quality as well as slowing the rate of near-term climate change. The main SLCPs of direct concern to health include black carbon (or soot), methane and ozone, which all contribute to both health-harmful air pollution and global warming. Black carbon (BC) is a component of fine particulate matter , the air pollutant most associated with premature death and morbidity. Ozone has significant adverse impacts on respiratory health, and methane contributes to ozone formation. Mitigation experts believe that firm actions reducing SLCP emissions could slow the pace of climate change by as much as 0.6 ⁰C over the next few decades. Even so, it is important to note that SLCP reduction measures complement, but do not replace, the actions needed to reduce longer-lived CO 2 emissions for climate stabilization."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants", "question": "Where do these pollutants come from?", "answer": "Open fires, (including wildfires, deliberate forest/brush burning, and burning of urban and crop waste), comprise the largest single source of black carbon emissions. Household fuel combustion and transport, account for roughly 77% of black carbon emissions from human activities related to energy production and use. Emissions from diesel, biomass and kerosene combustion are among the sources with the heaviest black carbon concentrations, and accordingly have been identified as priority sources for reducing emissions that contribute to near-term climate change. Particulate emissions from other sources, such as coal-fired power plants, are also a source of black carbon emissions. In health terms, however, mitigation efforts that reduce fine particulates from other sources can, of course, be beneficial, and may also reduce CO 2 and thus longer-term climate change. Ozone is not emitted directly but develops when a number of precursor pollution emissions interact in the presence of sunlight. Precursor emissions often include methane, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide. Ozone is the second SLCP that causes adverse respiratory effects, with impacts ranging from changes in lung function and increased incidence of asthma to premature mortality. Methane is a powerful SLCP in and of itself, mainly produced from the agriculture sector, including livestock production, waste sector, and as a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction and distribution. Methane emissions impact on health through their role in ozone formation."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants", "question": "What is the impact of SCLPs on health?", "answer": "Since SLCPs contribute to ambient levels of ozone and PM2.5, SCLP emissions are directly associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including heart disease, pulmonary disease, respiratory infections and lung cancer. SLCP emissions thus contribute significantly to the more than 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution. Indirectly, the SLCPs such as ozone can reduce plant photosynthesis and growth, thus decreasing agricultural yields, which in turn threatens food security. Ozone as well as black carbon can also affect weather patterns and the melting of snow and ice, which may harm and endanger health through extreme weather events such as floods."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants", "question": "What are the mitigation actions?", "answer": "As SLCP mitigation is seen as complementary to mitigation of CO2 emissions, same strategies considered to stabilize climate and ensure the health of future generations also examined the CO2 reduction potential. Four strategies were identified which appear to have the largest aggregate potential for health and SLCP mitigation benefits as well as reducing CO2. Policies and investments that prioritize dedicated rapid      transit and walking and cycling networks in compact cities can promote      health in multiple ways, including reduced air pollution exposures,      reduced injury risks and greater opportunities for safe active travel. Encouraging healthier diets rich in plant-based foods and low      in red and processed meats among affluent populations at risk of a range      of diet-related noncommunicable diseases will have a positive effect on      health and will also reduce emissions. Provide and promote the use of clean and efficient cook-stoves      and fuels, and cleaner energy sources, to the approximately 2.8 billion      low-income households that currently rely on solid fuels for heating and      cooking. Reducing vehicle emissions of both particulate matter as well      as ozone precursors (e.g. NO2) by implementing stricter vehicle emission and      fuel standards. Along with these four, however, many other SLCP measures identified in this report are also very beneficial to health. Examples include improved waste management strategies, more energy efficient homes and buildings, phasing out kerosene lamps and greater reliance on clean light and power sources, including renewable energy, for homes and health clinics, cleaner brick industries and coke ovens, etc. Measures outlined can reduce many other types of health risks, ranging from housing related diseases associated with exposure to extreme heat, cold or damp; sanitation-related diseases; air pollution from kerosene and generator fumes; work-related diseases, and so on."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-reducing-short-lived-climate-pollutants", "question": "What can I do?", "answer": "Some simple lifestyle choices coming from individuals can have potential benefits for reducing emissions and contributing to better health. Although policy decisions make up a big part for mitigation actions, the choices we make on what we eat, how we travel, and the energy sources we use, for example, choosing to take public transport over private cars and choosing a plant-based meal over red meat will contribute to the reduction of emissions and noise pollution while increasing health and well-being. Read more about short-lived climate pollutants in WHO’s policy brief."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What is mpox (monkeypox)?", "answer": "Mpox is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus. It is a viral infection which can spread between people, mainly through close contact, and occasionally from the environment to people via things and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. In settings where the monkeypox virus is present among some wild animals, it can also be transmitted from infected animals to people who have contact with them. Following a series of consultations with global experts, WHO has begun using a new preferred term “mpox” as a synonym for monkeypox. Read more on the background to this decision here ."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What are the symptoms of mpox?", "answer": "Mpox can cause a range of signs and symptoms. While some people have less severe symptoms, others may develop more serious illness and need care in a health facility. Common symptoms of mpox include a rash which may last for 2–4 weeks. This may start with, or be followed by, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands (lymph nodes). The rash looks like blisters or sores, and can affect the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, groin, genital and/or anal regions. These lesions may also be found in the mouth, throat, anus, rectum or vagina, or on the eyes. The number of sores can range from one to several thousand. Some people develop inflammation inside the rectum (proctitis) that can cause severe pain, as well as inflammation of the genitals that may cause difficulties urinating. In most cases, the symptoms of mpox go away on their own within a few weeks with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever. However, in some people, the illness can be severe or lead to complications and even death. Newborn babies, children, people who are pregnant and people with underlying immune deficiencies such as from advanced HIV disease may be at higher risk of more serious mpox disease and death. Severe disease due to mpox may include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood, and lung infections. Complications can include severe bacterial infection from skin lesions, mpox affecting the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia), and eye problems. People with severe mpox may require hospitalization, supportive care and antiviral medicines to reduce the severity of lesions and shorten time to recovery. According to available data, between 0.1% and 10% of people with mpox have died. It is important to note that death rates in different settings may differ due to several factors, such as access to health care and underlying immunosuppression, including because of undiagnosed HIV or advanced HIV disease."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "How does mpox spread?", "answer": "From person to person: Mpox spreads from person to person mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). During the global outbreak that began in 2022, the virus mostly spread through sexual contact. More research is needed on how mpox spreads during outbreaks in different settings and under different conditions. People with mpox are considered infectious until all their lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath, and all the lesions on the eyes and in the body (in the mouth, throat, eyes, vagina and anus) have healed too, which usually takes from 2 to 4 weeks. It is also possible for the virus to persist for some time on clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox. Someone else who touches these items may become infected, particularly if they have any cuts or abrasions or touch their eyes, nose, mouth or other mucous membranes without first washing their hands. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces/objects and cleaning your hands after touching surfaces/objects that may be contaminated can help prevent this type of transmission. The virus can also spread during pregnancy to the fetus, during or after birth through skin-to-skin contact, or from a parent with mpox to an infant or child during close contact. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, there is still limited information on whether the virus can be transmitted from someone with the virus before they get symptoms or after their lesions have healed. Although live virus has been isolated from semen, we do not yet know the extent to which infection can spread through semen, vaginal fluids, amniotic fluids, breastmilk or blood. From animals to humans: Someone who comes into physical contact with an animal which carries the virus, such as some species of monkeys or a terrestrial rodent (such as the tree squirrel) may also develop mpox. Exposure by such physical contact with an animal or meat can occur through bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping or preparing a meal. The virus can also be caught through eating contaminated meat which is not cooked thoroughly. The risk of getting mpox from animals can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In countries where animals carry the virus, any food containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating. From humans to animals: There have been a few reports of the virus being identified in pet dogs. However, it has not been confirmed whether these were true infections or whether the detection of virus was related to surface contamination. Since many species of animals are known to be susceptible to the virus, there is the potential for spillback of the virus from humans to animals in different settings. People who have confirmed or suspected mpox should avoid close physical contact with animals, including pets (such as cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils), livestock and wildlife. More detailed advice for pet owners and persons working with animals can be found in the WOAH risk guidance on reducing spillback of monkeypox virus . WHO continues to work with its One Health partners, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), to learn more about the natural reservoir of the virus and help countries to reduce the risk of mpox transmission from or to animals."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Who is at risk of mpox?", "answer": "People who have close contact with someone who has mpox are at risk of infection. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). People who have contact with clothing, bedding, towels, objects, electronics and other surfaces that have been touched by someone with mpox are also at risk. Anyone living with someone who has mpox should take steps to reduce the risk of becoming infected. A person who has been diagnosed with mpox should be assessed by a health care provider to determine if they are well enough to be cared for at home and if isolation can be safely managed at home. Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox (by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharps such as needles)."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men at higher risk of contracting mpox?", "answer": "The risk of mpox is not limited to people who are sexually active or gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who has symptoms is at risk and any person with multiple sex partners is also at risk. Most of the cases that were reported in the multi-country outbreak in 2022/2023 were identified among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Given that the virus moves from person to person in these sexual networks in many countries, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men may be at higher risk of being exposed if they have sex or other form of close contact with someone who is infectious. People who have multiple or new sexual partners are most at risk. Engaging communities of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men to raise awareness is essential to protect those most at risk. If you are a man who has sex with other men, know your risk and take steps to protect yourself and others. Anyone who has symptoms that could be mpox should seek advice from a health care provider immediately to get tested and get care. Sex workers and their clients are also at risk. Engaging sex worker organizations and networks to raise awareness and protect those most at risk is essential to stop mpox outbreaks. Public health advice for sex workers can be found here. Advice for managers of sex-on-premises venues can be found here ."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "How can I protect myself and others against mpox?", "answer": "To protect yourself and others against mpox, know the signs and symptoms, how the virus spreads, what to do if you get ill, and the risk in your area or community. If the virus is spreading in your area or in your community, have open conversations with those you come into close contact with about any symptoms you or they may have. Avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox, including sexual contact. Clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you think you might have mpox, you can act to protect others by seeking medical advice and isolating from others until you have been evaluated and tested. If you have mpox, you should isolate yourself from others until all your lesions have crusted over, the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath. This will stop you from passing on the virus to others. Follow your local health authority instructions on isolation at home or in a health facility. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered. In countries where some animals have been found to carry the monkeypox virus (i.e. some countries in in east, central and west Africa), protect yourself by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). Any food containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "I am travelling to an mpox-affected area. What precautions should I take?", "answer": "Before travelling, equip yourself with information about mpox, including its signs and symptoms, how it spreads, the behaviours that increase your risk of infection, and how to seek medical care at your destination. Be aware that the country you’re visiting, as well as your own, may have specific entry requirements; inform yourself about them. Your healthcare provider will be able to discuss vaccination for mpox with you and offer advice based on an individual risk assessment. If you have been in close contact or had sex with someone with mpox or were potentially exposed to mpox through contaminated objects such as bedding or needles, follow the health advice issued by national or local health authorities. If you develop symptoms, refrain from travelling, isolate yourself, and seek medical care immediately. Should you develop symptoms after your trip, seek medical care and inform healthcare providers of your travel history and other information that may facilitate medical assessment."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What do we know about mpox and sex?", "answer": "Mpox can spread through close contact of any kind, including through kissing, touching, oral and penetrative vaginal or anal sex with someone who is infectious. People who have sex with multiple or new partners are most at risk. Anyone with new and unusual rashes or lesions should avoid having sex or any other kind of close contact with other people until they have been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mpox. Remember that the rash can also be found in places that can be hard to see inside the body, including the mouth, throat, genitals, vagina and anus/anal area. If mpox is spreading through sex in your community or area, consider reducing your risk until the outbreak is brought under control by: openly communicating with partners about mpox symptoms and risks; exchanging contact details with sexual partners so that you can inform each other if you do develop symptoms; taking a break from having sex; reducing your number of new sexual partners, one off sexual partners, or anonymous sexual partners; consistently using condoms; avoiding group sex; avoiding sex-on-premises venues (such as cruising bars, saunas, darkrooms, commercial sex venues or any premises where sex is exchanged for money); avoiding using alcohol or drugs in sexual contexts (including chemsex); and, where and when available, by taking up the offer of vaccines. While the monkeypox virus has been found in semen, it is currently not known whether mpox can be spread through semen or vaginal fluids. Wearing a condom won’t fully protect you from mpox, but it may reduce your risk or extent of exposure and it will help protect you and others from HIV and a range of other STIs. People with mpox are advised to use condoms for 12 weeks after they recover. For more information on the risk of mpox and sex, please see the public health advice for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men , public health advice for sex workers on mpox , and public health advice on mpox and sex-on-premises venues and events ."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "I have mpox. What can I do to protect other people from getting infected?", "answer": "If you have mpox, your healthcare provider will advise you on what to do while you recover. Follow national advice on whether you should recover at home or if you need care in a health facility. In the meantime, it is important to avoid having close contact with others until your lesions have completely healed. If you are advised to isolate at home, protect those you live with as much as possible by: asking friends and family to help you by delivering things you need; isolating in a separate room; using a separate bathroom, or cleaning any surfaces you touched after each use; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces with soap and water and a household disinfectant; avoiding sweeping/vacuuming (this might disturb virus particles and cause others to become infected); using separate utensils, objects, electronics, or clean well with soap and water/disinfectant before sharing; not sharing towels, bedding or clothes; doing your own laundry (lift bedding, clothes and towels carefully without shaking them, put materials in a plastic bag before carrying it to the washing machine and wash them with hot water over 60 degrees Celsius); opening windows for good ventilation; and encouraging everyone in the house to clean their hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. If you cannot avoid being in the same room as someone else or having close contact with another person while isolating at home, then do your best to limit their risk by: avoiding touching each other; cleaning your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; covering your rash with clothing or bandages (until you can isolate again – your rash will heal best if uncovered); opening windows throughout the home; ensuring you and anyone in the room with you wear well-fitting medical masks; and maintaining at least 1 metre of distance from others. If you cannot do your own laundry and someone else needs to do it for you, they should wear a well-fitting medical mask, disposable gloves and take the laundry precautions listed above."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What care does someone with mpox need to recover fully?", "answer": "The care someone needs will depend on their symptoms and their risk of developing more severe disease. People with mpox should follow the advice of their health care provider. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks and usually go away on their own or with supportive care, such as medication for pain or fever (such as analgesics and antipyretics). It is important for anyone with mpox who is recovering at home to stay hydrated, eat well and get enough sleep. People who are self-isolating should take care of their mental health by doing things they find relaxing and enjoyable, staying connected to loved ones using technology, exercising if they feel well enough and can do so while isolating, and asking for support with their mental health if they need it. People with mpox should avoid scratching their skin and take care of their rash by cleaning their hands before and after touching lesions and keeping skin dry and uncovered (unless they are unavoidably in a room with someone else, in which case they should cover it with clothing or a bandage until they are able to isolate again). The rash can be kept clean with sterilized water or antiseptic. Saltwater rinses can be used for sores in the mouth, and warm baths with baking soda and Epsom salts can ease the discomfort of sores on the body. Paracetamol can be used to help manage the pain caused by lesions, if needed. If stronger pain medicine is needed, advice should be sought from a health care provider. See this infographic on recovering from mpox at home for some helpful tips."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Why does stigma related to mpox matter?", "answer": "When there is stigma or discrimination related to a medical condition, people may not seek care quickly, the quality of health care may suffer, and access to health services for the most vulnerable is reduced. It is possible to prevent or reduce stigma and discrimination related to mpox through strategies to offer stigma-free care, employ non-stigmatizing language, support people in seeking health care and create an enabling environment where the best quality of care is available. Read more here on how to address stigma and discrimination related to mpox."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What should I do if a child in my care has mpox?", "answer": "Children can catch mpox if they have close contact with someone who has symptoms. Children can be exposed to the virus at home from siblings, parents, caregivers, or other family members through close contact. In some settings in Africa, children and adolescents may be exposed through hunting or trapping activities or consumption of insufficiently cooked meat. Adolescents who have engaged in sexual activity with someone with mpox can also be exposed. The mpox rash can at first resemble other common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and other viral infections. If a child you are caring for has symptoms that could be mpox, seek advice from a healthcare provider. They will help to get them tested, and to access the care they need. Children may be at greater risk of severe mpox than adults. They should be closely monitored until they have recovered in case they need additional care. A health worker responsible for the child may advise that they are cared for in a health facility. In this situation, a parent or caregiver who is healthy and at low risk of mpox will be allowed to stay with them. If you have confirmed or suspected mpox and you are breastfeeding, talk to your healthcare provider for advice. They will assess the risk of transmitting mpox as well as the risk of withholding breastfeeding from your infant. If it is possible for you to continue to breastfeed and have close contact, they will advise you on how to reduce the risk by taking other measures, including covering up lesions. The risk of infection will need to be carefully balanced with the potential harm and distress caused by interrupting breastfeeding and close contact between parent and child. It is not yet known whether the monkeypox virus can be spread from parent to child through breastmilk; this is an area in need of further study."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Is there a treatment for mpox?", "answer": "Many years of research on therapeutics for smallpox have led to the development of products that may also be useful for treating mpox. For example, an antiviral developed to treat smallpox (tecovirimat) was approved in January 2022 by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of mpox under exceptional circumstances. Experience with these therapeutics in the context of an outbreak of mpox is growing but still limited. For this reason, their use is usually accompanied by enrolment in a clinical trial or expanded access protocol accompanied by the collection of information that will improve knowledge on how best to use them in future."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Are people who are immunosuppressed at higher risk of developing severe mpox (including people living with HIV)?", "answer": "Persons with immune suppression are at higher risk of developing severe mpox or dying. Severe mpox can include larger, more widespread lesions (especially in the mouth, eyes and genitals), conditions such as inflammation of the heart, brain or other organs, or secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections. People with advanced HIV disease (late presentation, low CD4 count and high HIV viral load) have an elevated risk of death if they develop severe mpox. This is more common in people with HIV status unknown prior to a diagnosis of mpox. People living with HIV who achieve viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment do not appear to be at any higher risk of severe mpox than the general population. Use of daily effective HIV treatment (antiretrovirals or ARVs) reduces the risk of developing severe mpox symptoms in the case of infection. People with untreated HIV and advanced HIV disease may be immunocompromised and therefore be at greater risk of severe mpox. WHO advises countries to integrate HIV and mpox testing, prevention and care. People who are sexually active and who do not know their HIV status are advised to seek a test for HIV. People living with HIV on effective treatment have the same life expectancy as their HIV negative peers. Severe mpox cases seen in some countries highlight the urgent need to increase equitable access to mpox diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutics, and to HIV prevention, testing and treatment. Without this, most affected groups are being left without the tools they need to protect their sexual health and well-being. If you are living with HIV, continue to take your HIV medication as directed. If you think you may have mpox, seek medical advice. If you think you are at risk for mpox or have been diagnosed with mpox, you may benefit from testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you don’t know your HIV status, ask your health worker for an HIV test. This will help your health care provider to ensure you receive the best possible care. In 2023 there were 9 million people in the world living with HIV but not on HIV treatment and who could be at risk for advanced HIV disease – 5 million of whom were living in Africa."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Is there a vaccine against mpox?", "answer": "Yes, there are vaccines recommended by WHO for use against mpox. Many years of research led to the development of newer and safer vaccines for smallpox (which no longer exists as it was eradicated) and mpox. At present, WHO recommends use of MVA-BN or LC16 vaccines for people at risk during an outbreak of mpox. ACAM2000 may also be used for certain people based on an individual assessment when other vaccines are not available."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Should I get vaccinated for mpox?", "answer": "Mpox vaccines provide protection against infection and severe disease. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether you should get vaccinated. This will depend on your individual risk as well as the availability of vaccines in your area. WHO recommends vaccination for people at high risk of exposure to mpox during an outbreak, such as health workers or people who have been in contact with someone with mpox. During outbreaks, WHO also recommends vaccination for children at high risk of exposure. Travellers who may be at risk, based on an individual risk assessment with their healthcare provider, may wish to consider vaccination. Whether vaccinated or not, continue to take care to avoid catching and spreading mpox. This is because it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated and because a few people may not fully respond to vaccination. For those who acquire mpox after vaccination, the vaccine still protects against severe disease and hospitalization."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What are the risks of mpox during pregnancy?", "answer": "Contracting mpox during pregnancy (which is considered a relative immunosuppressed state) can be dangerous for the fetus or newborn infant and can lead to loss of the pregnancy, stillbirth, death of the newborn, or complications for the parent. If you are pregnant, avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious can get mpox, regardless of who they are. If you think you have been exposed to or are showing symptoms that could be mpox, contact your healthcare provider. They will help you get tested and access the care you need."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "Can I get mpox during social events, parties or other gatherings? How can I reduce my risk?", "answer": "Anyone attending a gathering is at risk of contracting mpox if they come into close contact with someone with mpox. Mpox can spread through skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and by being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). Mpox can also spread through contact with contaminated materials or objects such as sheets or needles. Crowded gatherings where people are close together, or where people spend an extended time together in a closed space, carry more risk. To reduce the risk of transmission at gatherings, avoid close contact, including sexual contact, with anyone showing symptoms of mpox. If you develop symptoms isolate yourself, ensuring you avoid any close contact with others, and seek professional medical advice. Consider vaccination if you are at high risk of exposure, based on a healthcare provider's recommendation."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "I’ve had mpox in the past. Can I catch it again?", "answer": "Our understanding of how long immunity following mpox lasts continues to evolve. There have been some cases of second infections reported. A few people may get mpox despite having had it before. Even if you have had mpox in the past, you should be doing everything you can to avoid getting re-infected. If you have had mpox in the past and someone in your household has it now, you can protect others by being the designated caregiver, as you are more likely to have some immunity than others. However, you should still take all precautions to avoid exposure as far as possible."}
{"topic": "/mpox", "question": "What are the different virus clades and how do they differ in impact?", "answer": "There are two broad clades of the virus: clade I and II. Clade II was behind the global mpox outbreak that began in 2022. The current understanding is that clade I leads to more severe disease and death than clade II in the populations where it is endemic. However, differences in the features of past outbreaks such as population groups affected make it hard to draw a firm conclusion. Public health advice from WHO applies for prevention and management of mpox arising from either clade. A new offshoot of clade I virus, called clade Ib, was first reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023, and has been spreading through sex and other types of close contact. Studies are underway to understand the properties of this new strain."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-similarities-and-differences-with-influenza", "question": "How are COVID-19 and influenza similar?", "answer": "1. COVID-19 and influenza both predominantly affect the respiratory system Both infections are caused by viruses (SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and influenza viruses cause influenza), but their effect on individuals can vary. Some individuals have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Other people may suffer from severe disease, requiring hospitalization. Both COVID-19 and influenza can be fatal. In many cases COVID-19 and influenza cause similar symptoms, including cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, headache and fatigue. Learn more about COVID-19 signs and symptoms . Learn more about seasonal influenza . Contact your healthcare provider if you have or someone you know has any of the following severe symptoms, including: difficulty breathing, especially at rest, or being unable to speak in sentences confusion drowsiness or loss of consciousness persistent pain or pressure in the chest skin being cold or clammy or turning pale or a bluish colour loss of speech or movement. 2. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus spread in similar ways Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses spread mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The viruses can spread through the air from an infected person’s mouth or nose in infectious respiratory (small liquid) particles when they cough, sneeze, speak or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled or land on mucosal membranes. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses spread more easily in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings and where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because infectious respiratory particles can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance. People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the influenza or SARS-CoV-2 virus. 3. Many risk factors for severe disease are common to both COVID-19 and influenza Most people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses make a full recovery without needing hospital treatment, but some people can get severely ill and may die. Although this can happen to anyone, the following groups are at higher risk for severe disease and death when they have an infection: older adults; people of any age with chronic medical conditions such as obesity, chronic diseases of the heart, lung (e.g. asthma or COPD), kidney, nervous system, liver or blood, and metabolic problems such as diabetes; people with immunocompromising disease (such as those that can be caused by HIV or cancer), or as a result of medical treatment (for example those prescribed steroid treatments); and pregnant people or people in the postnatal period. Health and care workers are more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses and may have a higher risk of getting infected. 4. Many of the same protective measures are effective against COVID-19 and influenza The following actions could help protect you and others from COVID-19 and influenza: stay up to date with vaccinations against COVID-19 and influenza, especially if you are at high risk of exposure or severe disease; practice respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette by covering the nose and mouth with a bent elbow or tissues while coughing or sneezing; clean your hands regularly; wear a mask when in crowded, enclosed, or poorly ventilated areas if you have symptoms, have tested positive for COVID-19 or influenza, or are at risk for severe COVID-19 or influenza infection; and stay home if you are sick. Seek advice from professional healthcare providers if you have symptoms."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-similarities-and-differences-with-influenza", "question": "How are COVID-19 and influenza different?", "answer": "1. Some treatments for COVID-19 and influenza are different COVID-19 and influenza are caused by different viruses. However, general and supportive measures are a core part of treatment for both. Treatment for all hospitalized patients with severe respiratory illness (due to COVID-19, influenza or another cause) includes oxygen and advanced respiratory support such as the use of ventilators. There are also specific treatments depending on which virus is causing the illness. WHO has specific guidelines for treating both COVID-19 and influenza, which are updated frequently based on new evidence. For more information, visit Clinical practice guidelines for influenza . If you have questions about your treatment options, consult your healthcare provider. Different antiviral medicines are used to reduce severe complications and death for COVID-19 and influenza. Antiviral medicines for influenza will not be effective against COVID-19 and vice-versa. Recommendations for antivirals and other treatments vary by the severity of illness. COVID-19: For COVID-19, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is strongly recommended for patients at high-risk of severe disease, although there are other options for these patients if this antiviral medicine isn’t available. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are severely ill, specific treatment options include corticosteroids, interleukin-6 blocking drugs (such as tocilizumab or sarilumab) and baricitinib. Several other treatment options for COVID-19 are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Influenza: For influenza which is non-severe (that is the patient does not need admission to hospital), WHO suggests the use of the antiviral baloxavir only if the patient is at high risk of progressing to severe disease. This might be the case for those over 65 years of age, or those with a major risk factor. WHO does not recommend any other antiviral for people with non-severe influenza. For severe influenza, WHO suggests the use of oseltamivir. WHO does not recommend other antivirals for patients with severe influenza and recommends against corticosteroids in these patients. 2. Vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza are different Vaccines against COVID-19 do not protect against influenza, and similarly, influenza vaccines do not protect against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination protects against severe disease and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection and influenza vaccination protects against severe disease and death from infection with influenza viruses. It is safe and effective to receive both vaccines at the same time (e.g. during the same appointment with your medical provider). Follow the advice of your health care provider on getting the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines approved for use by WHO are proven to be safe and effective to protect against severe illness and death caused by COVID-19 disease. More than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally since 2021. Those in the high-priority use group for COVID-19 vaccination include older adults, and adults with severe obesity or chronic conditions. Groups with special considerations for COVID-19 vaccination include persons with immunocompromising conditions (adults, adolescents, and children > 6 months), pregnant people, and health and care workers with direct patient contact. The protection wanes over time and COVID-19 revaccination is recommended 6–12 months after the last dose, depending on risk group, or once during each pregnancy. Influenza vaccines are also safe and effective and have been used for decades. Influenza, like many other viruses, has different variants. Vaccines are produced each year based on the expected circulating variants in the coming influenza season. It is therefore recommended to get the most up-to-date vaccine annually. WHO recommends yearly vaccination to prevent severe influenza disease in high-risk groups including older adults, individuals with chronic or immunocompromising conditions, and pregnant people. Health workers are recommended for vaccination due to their increased risk of exposure to or transmission of influenza virus. Depending on national priorities and disease burden, countries may consider additional populations for vaccination such as children or people at high risk of influenza living in congregate settings, and indigenous people.

The vaccines protect against the development of severe disease from infection with different viruses, so you need both vaccinations to be protected against both illnesses. COVID-19 vaccines (including variant-containing vaccines) may be co-administered (that is, vaccines can be given at the same appointment) with seasonal influenza vaccines, or at any time before or after other vaccines for adults and adolescents. Both vaccines can be co-administered with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy. Questions and answers on COVID-19 vaccines . More information on seasonal influenza vaccination ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-similarities-and-differences-with-influenza", "question": "Are the seasonality patterns for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza the same?", "answer": "The seasonality pattern for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established and we don’t yet see the typical seasonal patterns for COVID-19 like we have seen for influenza. However, many respiratory virus illnesses tend to increase during the winter primarily due to environmental conditions and human behaviours (e.g. people spending more time in close contact indoors. COVID-19 has circulation peaks several times of the year of the year often driven by newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and waning immunity. In temperate climates, seasonal influenza epidemics typically occur during autumn and winter while in tropical regions influenza peaks may occur throughout the year."}

{"topic": "/heatwaves-how-to-stay-cool", "question": "What’s the best advice for staying safe during a heatwave?", "answer": "To protect yourself during a heatwave, you should: Keep your body cool and hydrated. Keep your home cool. Protect infants and children. Stay out of the heat. Avoid going outside during the hottest time of the ay. Stay in the shade. Remember that reported temperatures are measured in the shade, and it can be 10-15˚C hotter in the sun. Avoid strenuous physical activity if you can. If you must do strenuous activity, do it during the coolest part of the day, which can be in the morning between 04:00 and 07:00 Do not leave children or animals in parked vehicles. Move to the coolest room in the home, especially at night. If it is not possible to keep your home cool, spend 2–3 hours of the day in a cool place (such as an airconditioned public building). Regularly check in with vulnerable people in your circle – especially people over 65 years old and those with heart, lung, or kidney conditions, a disability, and living alone."}
{"topic": "/heatwaves-how-to-stay-cool", "question": "How do I keep my body cool during a heatwave?", "answer": "Do the following to keep cool during a heatwave: Use light and loose-fitting clothing and bed linens.  In order to avoid heat accumulation, do not use cushions. Take cool showers or baths. Wet your skin using a damp cloth, a spray bottle, or wet clothing. Drink water regularly (1 cup of water per hour and at least 2–3 litres per day).  Avoid alcohol and too much caffeine. If you go outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat or cap and sunglasses."}
{"topic": "/heatwaves-how-to-stay-cool", "question": "What should I do if I feel unwell during a heatwave?", "answer": "Heatstroke is a potentially fatal medical emergency. Seek medical attention immediately if you or others feel faint, dizzy, or nauseous, stop sweating, show signs of delirium or lose consciousness. It’s crucial to take heatstroke seriously and act quickly, as delays can lead to severe complications or even death. 1. Call for emergency medical help Dial emergency services immediately to get professional medical assistance on the way before doing anything else. 2. Aggressive cooling Use any available means to cool the person down while waiting for medical help. Move the person to a shady or air-conditioned location immediately and apply cold, wet cloths or towels to their body. Use ice packs and fans if available. Loosen or remove any unnecessary clothing to help the person cool down. 3. Monitor until help arrives Keep a close eye on the person’s condition while waiting for medical assistance. Look for signs of improvement or deterioration. Do not give the person suffering heatstroke acetylsalicylic acid (commonly known as aspirin) or paracetamol. Position an unconscious person on their side. If you feel dizzy, weak, anxious or have intense thirst and headache during a heatwave, it is best to move to a cool place as soon as possible and measure your body temperature. Drink some water to rehydrate. Rest immediately in a cool place if you have painful muscular spasms (particularly in the legs, arms or abdomen), and drink oral rehydration solutions containing electrolytes. Medical attention is needed if heat cramps last more than 1 hour. Consult your doctor if you feel unusual symptoms or if symptoms persist."}
{"topic": "/heatwaves-how-to-stay-cool", "question": "How do I keep my home cool during a heatwave?", "answer": "During a heatwave you should aim to keep your living space cool. Check the room temperature between 08:00 and 10:00, at 13:00 and at night after 22:00. Ideally, the room temperature should be kept below 32 °C during the day and 24 °C during the night. This is especially important for infants, adults over the age of 60 years or those who have chronic health conditions. Use the night air to cool down your home by opening windows after dark. During the day, close windows and cover them with blinds or shutters to block sunlight. Turn off as many electrical devices as possible. Use electric fans only when temperatures are below 40 ˚C. In temperatures above 40 ˚C fans will heat the body. If using air conditioning, set the thermostat to 27 ˚C and turn on an electric fan, this will make the room feel 4 ˚C cooler. Remember that it may be cooler outdoors in the shade. If your residence is air conditioned, close the doors and windows and conserve electricity not needed to keep you cool, to ensure that power remains available and reduce the chance of a community-wide outage. Electric fans may provide relief, but when the temperature is above 35 °C, may not prevent heat-related illness. It is important to drink fluids."}
{"topic": "/heatwaves-how-to-stay-cool", "question": "How do I protect children during a heatwave?", "answer": "To protect children during a heatwave: Never leave children or animals in parked vehicles for any amount of time, as temperatures can quickly become dangerously high. Avoid direct exposure to the sun during peak hours, seeking shade or staying indoors instead. Never cover an infant stroller or pram with dry fabric .  Doing so makes it hotter inside the carriage. Instead, use a wet, thin cloth and re-wet as necessary to lower the temperature. Combine with a portable fan for even greater cooling. Dress children in lightweight, loose-fitting clothing that covers their skin, and use wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses and sunscreen to protect them from the sun’s rays. Follow the guidance on keeping your home cool to maintain a safe indoor temperature."}
{"topic": "/oxygen", "question": "What is oxygen?", "answer": "Oxygen (O 2 ) is a chemical element. At standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms bind together to form a colourless and odourless gas with a molecular mass of 32 atomic mass units (amu). Together with nitrogen and argon, oxygen is one of the three major constituents of Earth’s atmosphere, being present in 21% of air."}
{"topic": "/oxygen", "question": "What is medicinal oxygen?", "answer": "Medicinal oxygen is an essential medicine with no substitution. Medicinal oxygen composition is established in the pharmacopeias, such as the International Pharmacopeia . Healthcare professionals use it to treat respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and pneumonia. It is administered to patients as an inhalation gas. Medicinal oxygen differs from industrial oxygen in that medicinal oxygen is tested to meet authorized specifications for its identity, purity and content by following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Storage and Distribution Practices (GSDP) established in the regulatory framework for medicinal gases."}
{"topic": "/oxygen", "question": "What is the medical oxygen ecosystem?", "answer": "The oxygen ecosystem refers to holistic efforts, initiatives and resources across health systems, that are required for an optimal and sustainable implementation of oxygen systems. In addition to equipment and the medicine itself, the oxygen ecosystem also covers all of the other activities to ensure that oxygen systems can function safely, effectively and continuously.  The ecosystem considers context, policies, guidelines, need-gap assessments, health infrastructure, the selection of appropriate systems, costing and financing, partnerships, implementation, operation and maintenance, training, monitoring and evaluation.  And sustaining oxygen ecosystems means revisiting all of these aspects at a set frequency."}
{"topic": "/oxygen", "question": "What are oxygen systems?", "answer": "The oxygen systems for medical use include, but are not limited to, oxygen source (or production), storage, distribution and delivery supplies, as well as various items for flow regulation, conditioning, quality assurance (QA), quality control (QC) and safety. The long-term sustainability of oxygen systems requires a holistic approach, and a resource ecosystem focused not only on oxygen production but also on distribution and delivery, ongoing maintenance and upkeep."}
{"topic": "/oxygen", "question": "What is a pulse oximeter and how to use it?", "answer": "Pulse oximetry is the most accurate non-invasive method for detecting hypoxaemia.  Pulse oximeters are reliable and now available at low cost. By detecting and monitoring hypoxaemia, it can help us make more efficient use of oxygen supplies and improve patient safety – a pulse oximeter is an essential medical device. It measures the percentage of oxygenated haemoglobin (SpO 2 ). The pulse oximeter consists of a light source, a sensor, and an electronic chip to calculate, and a screen to display the results. In addition to the oxygen saturation and the pulse rate, many models also show a representation of the pulse wave (plethysmography). After the probe is clipped to the finger, toe or earlobe, it can give a result in seconds.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "What vaccines protect against COVID-19?", "answer": "All COVID-19 vaccines, listed by WHO as for emergency use or prequalified , provide protection against severe disease and death resulting from COVID-19 infection. There are several types of COVID-19 vaccines, including: Inactivated or weakened virus vaccines: These use an inactivated      or weakened version of the virus that doesn’t cause disease but still      generates an immune response, Protein-based vaccines: These contain harmless      fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the COVID-19 virus to      safely generate an immune response, Viral vector vaccines: These use a safe virus that      cannot cause disease but serves as a vehicle to produce coronavirus      proteins to generate an immune response, and mRNA and DNA vaccines: These are genetically engineered RNA or DNA which create proteins that safely activate an immune response. For the latest information on vaccines, please visit the COVID-19 vaccines page . Watch the “Vaccines Explained” series for an explanation of the different types of COVID-19 vaccines ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Who should get vaccinated against COVID-19?", "answer": "WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) provides timely recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination. SAGE’s latest recommendations , summarized below, consider high population immunity from vaccination and/or infection. One dose for those who have never received any COVID-19 vaccine, especially those who are at high risk of severe illness such as older persons, adults with chronic diseases, individuals with immunocompromising conditions and health workers with direct patient contact. One dose for pregnant persons, during each pregnancy. Revaccination 6 to 12 months after the most recent dose for older adults, adults with comorbidities, persons who are immunocompromised and health workers with direct patient contact. Revaccination is not routinely recommended to healthy adults, adolescents and children. For optimal protection, it is important to receive the recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses. Consult with your health care provider for specific advice. Refer to the following WHO page for the latest advice: COVID-19 advice for the public: Getting vaccinated ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Who should not be vaccinated against COVID-19?", "answer": "There are very few conditions that would exclude someone from being vaccinated. You should NOT be vaccinated if: You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines, or You have a fever over 38.5 ºC on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered. COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people taking blood thinners. However, prior to being vaccinated, inform the health staff administering the vaccine of any medication that you are taking. Each vaccine may have specific considerations for certain groups or health conditions, so it would be best to discuss with your health care provider about your specific situation."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "How long does protection from a COVID-19 vaccine last against severe disease and death?", "answer": "Protection against severe disease and death is highest in the first few months after vaccination and then starts to decrease. The duration of protection can vary depending on vaccination history, past infection, the type of vaccine received and circulating COVID-19 variants. Revaccination is recommended 6 to12 months after the last dose for high-risk persons including older adults, individuals with chronic and/or immunocompromised conditions and health workers with direct patient contact. Revaccination during each pregnancy is recommended."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Who should be revaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine?", "answer": "WHO recommends revaccination as follows: Revaccination 6 to 12 months after the most recent dose for: adults over 75 or 80 years old adults over 50 or 60 years old with comorbidities adults, adolescents and children who are immunocompromised Revaccination 12 months after the most recent dose for: adults over 50 or 60 years old adults with comorbidities health workers with direct patient contact For pregnant persons, a single dose is recommended in each pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Can children and adolescents get vaccinated against COVID-19?", "answer": "Healthy children and adolescents ages 6 months to 17 years belong to the low-priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccinating them post-pandemic has limited public health impact. However, countries can consider vaccinating this group based on disease burden, cost-effectiveness, programmatic factors and other public health priorities. Children and adolescents at higher risk of severe COVID-19 (those who are immunocompromised, with severe obesity or with comorbidities) and never received COVID-19 vaccination should get one dose."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Do all COVID-19 vaccines protect against virus variants/subvariants?", "answer": "Yes, all WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against severe disease and death from circulating COVID-19 variants. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines can be used either for the initial series or revaccination. Vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of newer versions of the COVID-19 vaccine. For people at a high risk of getting severe COVID-19, a dose of any available vaccine is more beneficial than delaying vaccination."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Should I be vaccinated if I have had COVID-19?", "answer": "The recent SAGE Roadmap recommends that individuals who previously had COVID-19 should still be vaccinated. Vaccination is recommended for those who have never received any COVID-19 vaccine and are at high risk of severe illness such as older persons, adults with chronic diseases, individuals with immunocompromising conditions and health workers with direct patient contact. Pregnant persons should get one dose. Revaccination 6 to 12 months after the most recent dose is recommended for older adults, adults with comorbidities, persons who are immunocompromised and health workers with direct patient contact. Hybrid immunity — the immunity one receives from both vaccination and prior COVID-19 infection — enhances protection against the severe outcomes of future COVID-19 infections and offers longer protection than infection alone."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Can I be revaccinated with a vaccine different from my previous dose?", "answer": "It is safe for you to receive a COVID-19 vaccine different from the one used for the previous dose(s). If you’re offered a different type of vaccine, you can go ahead and get vaccinated. Depending on the type of vaccine, using a different type of vaccine may provide better protection than using the same type of vaccine."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Can I still get COVID-19 after I have been vaccinated?", "answer": "Yes. While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious disease and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. Vaccinated people can get infected and may fall ill with COVID-19. This is known as a ‘breakthrough infection’ or ‘breakthrough case’. Breakthrough infections can happen with any vaccine and do not mean that the vaccine does not work. People who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated are much more likely to only experience mild symptoms as effectiveness against serious illness and death remains high. Vaccine effectiveness wanes over time, so it’s important to stay updated with your shots as recommended by your health care provider."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Can I receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID-19 vaccine?", "answer": "Yes, it is safe to receive other vaccines, such as the seasonal influenza vaccine, other respiratory vaccines or those recommended during pregnancy, on the same day as the COVID-19 vaccine. This allows you to receive protection against several diseases in one visit and at optimal timing. When given together, the vaccines should be injected in different injection sites."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "Like with any vaccine, some people will experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19. This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines include fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. More serious or long-lasting side effects of COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. National health authorities monitor vaccines to detect and respond to rare adverse events. At the regional and global level, WHO also supports countries in monitoring vaccine safety."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective?", "answer": "WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) monitors how approved vaccines behave in the real world to identify any signals of adverse events following immunization. GACVS is an independent group of experts providing authoritative, scientific advice to WHO on vaccine safety issues of global or regional concern. Unprecedented scientific collaborations allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time – to meet the urgent need for these vaccines during the acute phase of the pandemic – while maintaining high safety standards. Vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large Phase III clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy before they are introduced in national immunization programs. Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence are required by WHO for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers it approved for emergency use listing or prequalification. Billions of people have received the COVID-19 vaccine to date, showing that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccinations outweigh the risks of getting ill with COVID-19. Do not delay COVID-19 vaccination if it is recommended for you by your health care provider. Getting vaccinated could protect you from severe illness and save your life."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 if I am pregnant?", "answer": "Yes, WHO recommends a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during each pregnancy. Pregnant persons are at a higher risk from COVID-19, which can affect both them and the baby. Vaccination during pregnancy is safe. It also benefits the baby, as it allows the antibodies created to be passed from mother to child. These antibodies can also help protect the baby for the first few months of life. The COVID-19 vaccine can be safely given at any time during pregnancy to avoid missing opportunities. Vaccination in the mid-second trimester maximizes protection. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines can be safely administered with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy (for example, seasonal influenza and maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine). You can learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Should I get vaccinated if I want to have a baby in the future?", "answer": "Yes, you should get vaccinated if you are planning to get pregnant. There is no evidence that suggests the COVID-19 vaccines interfere with fertility. There is currently no biological evidence that antibodies from COVID-19 vaccination or vaccine ingredients could cause any problems with reproductive organs."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines", "question": "Should I get vaccinated against COVID-19 if I am breastfeeding?", "answer": "If you are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated against COVID-19 with the available vaccine according to your national recommendations. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them. This means there is no risk of you passing COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk. In fact, the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby."}
{"topic": "/determinants-of-health", "question": "What are the determinants of health?", "answer": "The determinants of health include: the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person’s individual characteristics and behaviours. The context of people’s lives determine their health, and so blaming individuals for having poor health or crediting them for good health is inappropriate. Individuals are unlikely to be able to directly control many of the determinants of health. These determinants—or things that make people healthy or not—include the above factors, and many others: Income and social status - higher income and social status are linked to better health. The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health. Education – low education levels are linked with poor health, more stress and lower self-confidence. Physical environment – safe water and clean air, healthy workplaces, safe houses, communities and roads all contribute to good health. Employment and working conditions – people in employment are healthier, particularly those who have more control over their working conditions Social support networks – greater support from families, friends and communities is linked to better health. Culture - customs and traditions, and the beliefs of the family and community all affect health. Genetics - inheritance plays a part in determining lifespan, healthiness and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses. Personal behaviour and coping skills – balanced eating, keeping active, smoking, drinking, and how we deal with life’s stresses and challenges all affect health. Health services - access and use of services that prevent and treat disease influences health Gender - Men and women suffer from different types of diseases at different ages."}
{"topic": "/determinants-of-health", "question": "How does evidence-based approach work within health impact assessment?", "answer": "An evidence base about the impact that projects, programmes and policies have had on health is required to carry out health impact assessment (HIA). The best available evidence is used within the appraisal stage of HIA to determine what impacts may occur (both positive and negative), the size of the impact (if possible) and the distribution of that impact in different population groups. It is generally assumed that the evidence for health impacts exists, and that searching and collating will provide the necessary evidence. Unfortunately this is not often the case, and the evidence of health impacts is often not available. This is because of the long causal pathway between the implementation of a project/programme/policy and any potential impact on population health, and the many confounding factors that make the determination of a link difficult. Within the HIA it is important therefore to be explicit about sources of evidence and to identify missing or incomplete information. Providing a comprehensive review of the evidence base is not simple. It needs to draw on the best available evidence – that from reviews and research papers, and including qualitative and quantitative evidence. This information must be supplemented with local and expert knowledge, policy information, and proposal specific information.

{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What is this report on \"Personal interventions and risk communication on air pollution\" about ?", "answer": "This report presents the results of an expert consultation whose objectives were to review and\nassess the current scientific evidence on questions related to protection measures that individuals can take (or so-called personal interventions) to reduce their exposure to air pollution. Such\nmeasures include wearing respirators, using indoor portable air filters (cleaners) or avoiding certain places and limiting activities or exercising in an environment with high levels of air pollution. It\nwas agreed, however, that these measures are the least desirable choice in the hierarchy of interventions - the most preferred being public policies aiming at reducing emissions. The report also\ndiscusses the communication challenges associated to information related to air pollution and health\nimpacts, such as air pollution sources, Air Quality Index (AQI), and the role of medical societies."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What should policy makers do to protect citizen from air pollution?", "answer": "The best way to protect people from the harmful effects of air pollution is to bring concentrations of air pollutants down to those recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines, through\npollutant emission monitoring, land-use and urban planning, and sustainable consumption. Policy makers and citizens need to know the sources of air pollutants and their contributions to air\npollution in each location, and this information should guide effective emission control strategies.\nOne of the most significant pollutants, particulate matter (PM2.5), can originate from a wide range\nof sources and can be spread over several hundreds of kilometres, illustrating the importance of\nnational and regional cooperation to recognizing and addressing the specific sources and combatting air pollution efficiently."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What are effective ways to communicate about air pollution and health?", "answer": "Successful communication approaches to policy makers and administrations should underline\nthe importance of source apportionment, emission control of the sources, population weighted\nexposure as a guidance of the interventions, the importance of regional in addition to local policies,\nand the relevance of the co-benefits of other policies (e.g. climate mitigation). The public should\nbe informed about the complexity of the issue and of the relative importance of the sources.\nSuccessful communication approaches to the public should include communication on local,\npersonal, feasible actions that can be undertaken by individuals to mitigate air pollution. People are\nmotivated by a sense of self-efficacy and neglect hazards that they cannot reduce. However, communication strategies should be tailored to the geography, economic conditions,\nculture, expectations and norms in each setting. Messages should be specific for the general public\nand for sensitive individuals. Help in adapting messages can be provided by social structures such\nas schools and other educational facilities, local and regional administrative structures, and institutions of the civil society, such as patients organizations, professional societies, and specific interest\ngroups. Trust in expert knowledge should be built by issuing publicly accessible information on\nfacts, evidence and peer-reviewed data and results."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What is an air pollution or quality index?", "answer": "An air quality index (AQI), or Air quality and health index (AQHI) or Air pollution index (API) is a\ncommon tool for the reporting and communication of the state of air quality at the city or at regional\nlevel on as short-term basis. Ideally, it expresses air quality in easily understood terms. AQI is also used\nto make recommendations aimed at reducing air pollution exposure and to provide health advisories to\nmembers of the public, including those who are more vulnerable to adverse air pollution exposures."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "How is an air pollution or quality index calculated?", "answer": "An AQI generally includes more than one pollutant and provides, with a simple scheme\n(for example using colours), a grading of the current air quality. It is most often reported on an hourly basis. Nearly all indices are set as ratios to predetermined\nthresholds based on either regulatory or recommended levels, which are locally or nationally set.\nHowever, few indices are based on rigorous health-based evidence."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Can different AQIs be compared?", "answer": "There is currently no harmonized method for calculating AQI. As the methodology and chosen\nthresholds vary by country, AQIs are intrinsically not valuable for international comparisons.\nIndeed, they can be quite misleading when used in this way. It is advised that all jurisdictions also report the actual measurement data in normal units (e.g. μg/\nm3) for all included pollutants in addition to their local AQI, including which pollutant is contribu-\nting the most, as people may be sensitive to different pollutants."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "How useful are AQIs?", "answer": "An AQI is useful if by providing relevant timely air quality information to the public and vulnerable\ngroups, it can reduce exposure to air pollution through individual behaviour modification, while public authorities ensure a timely reduction of emissions activities. These interventions by their very\nnature are only used sporadically, therefore their effectiveness depends on whether individuals\nhave information that is applicable, reliable, and understandable and if relevant actions are feasible\nin the affected population. Often, these indices summarize several air pollutant concentrations in one number, which makes it\ndifficult to isolate the effect of one specific pollutant. For example, in some cases the same index\ncan result from a combination of low particle and high ozone exposure or a combination of high\nparticle and low ozone concentration. As patients are often not affected by all pollutants, a combined index makes it more difficult to react accordingly. Even indices that have been specifically designed based on health research have been mostly based\non long term population-level health risks. Therefore, they are not designed to capture short term risk increases to especially vulnerable groups, such as babies or respiratory disease patients."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Who is more at risk of air pollution?", "answer": "Two groups of people are at a higher risk from air pollution than the general population. People\nwho are more susceptible have an increased response to exposure to air pollution. This increased\nresponse comes from an innate or acquired predisposition, such as pre-existing conditions or\ndiseases. Moreover, some people are more vulnerable, which means they have an increased\nexposure, which is due to external factors such as place of residence, type of occupation, or\ninternal factors such as increased ventilation (children), etc. While one can argue that almost everyone may fit into one of these categories, the following categories\nare generally considered more at risk: People with pre-existing conditions (e.g. cardiorespiratory) Children & Pregnant women Elderly Outdoor workers It is particularly important for pregnant women, children and old people and patients with cardio-\nvascular, cerebrovascular or respiratory disease to reduce short-term exposure (hours to weeks) to\nair pollution. Reducing long-term exposure (weeks to year) is important for everybody."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Should susceptible or vulnerable people be recommended personal interventions?", "answer": "Some evidence exists for children and people with cardiorespiratory conditions to recommend\r\nclinicians to provide guidance about the health risks of air pollution and behavioral aspects\r\nsuch as avoidance or reduction of pollution exposure, physical activity and personal protection.\r\nYet, prioritization of risk and unintended consequences need to be balanced."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Are specific recommendations on reducing exposure during major air pollution episodes useful in protecting health?", "answer": "Public health recommendations aiming at reducing exposure to decrease risk of acute harm often\noccur during major pollution episodes, however, greatest health benefit is likely to happen when\nexposure reduction occurs on in the long run, reducing risk of chronic harm. Providing recommendations to avoid or reduce exposure may not always be possible or even\nadvisable depending on individual circumstances. However, modifying the location, timing, and type\nof outdoor activity can greatly modify pollution exposures since the levels of air pollutants vary both\nspatially and temporally."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Should people remain indoors during a major air pollution episode?", "answer": "Avoiding air pollution through staying indoors may be beneficial but the effect largely depends on\nthe level of indoor exposure. There are many potential sources of indoor air pollution – such as\ncooking, active and passive smoking, incense burning – in addition to the infiltration of air pollutants from outdoors to indoors, which in turn is a function of many factors (e.g. type of ventilation,\nbuilding specificities, etc.). During acute episodes of air pollution, emergency interventions may be applied by local authorities, including school closures and limitation of sports events, as part of a risk management\nstrategy. However: the reduction in exposure of populations and the health benefits of these\ninterventions are not clear or may be reversed, depending on various circumstances, and the\npotential benefits and harms should be quantified with more research."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What are the links between air pollution and physical activity?", "answer": "Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require\nenergy expenditure. Popular ways to be active are through walking, cycling, sports and recreation\nor any activities undertaken while working, playing, or carrying out household chores. Physical activity has significant health benefits and contributes to prevent non-communicable\ndiseases. On the other hand, physical activity may influence the uptake and deposit of air pollutants in the lungs and airways. At higher air pollutants concentrations, more air pollutants will be\ninhaled. High air pollution levels may also prevent people from engaging in physical activity."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Is it safe to exercise (either through occupation, active transport or recreational physical activity) when the levels of air pollutions are high?", "answer": "Evidence on healthy adult populations in high-income countries advocates for regular physical activity, even if the air quality does not meet the levels recommended by WHO, as it provides health\nbenefits. However, scientific evidence is weak for all the examined associations in low and middle-\nincome countries (LMIC), for indoor settings (e.g. households, dedicated places for physical activity\npractice), and for susceptible subpopulations (children, old, people with pre-existing conditions). Specifically, evidence on short-term impacts suggest that air pollution diminishes (but not eliminate) the beneficial effects of physical activity, in populations with diseases such as cardiovascular\nand respiratory conditions and for those who are healthy. In the long-term, studies suggest that\nair pollution slightly reduces the protective effect of physical activity on mortality. Also, modelling\nstudies have estimated that in most situations, the benefits of physical activity should be larger\nthan risks of air pollution, at least in walking and cycling environments."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Should people at risk be advised to reduce their physical activity levels during air pollution episodes?", "answer": "In general, regular physical activity should be promoted even if the local air quality is not\noptimal. Whenever possible, people should adapt the timing and location of physical activity to\nreduce exposure to air pollution. Any recommendation should include consideration of ozone and\ntemperature levels, especially in warmer climates. Patients who take medication should follow\ntheir physician’s recommendations. Going by the precautionary principle, populations at specific risk (due to their health status\nor occupation) should be advised about the best time and location for physical activity or for\nwork (e.g. outdoors) and to reduce moderate–vigorous physical or work outdoors during high air\npollution episodes. In addition to regional action, local action to reduce daily background air pollution should be\npromoted in order to ensure physical activity under the best conditions for health."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What does the report say on portable air filters?", "answer": "Staying indoor is one way to reduce exposure from air pollution, provided that indoor air pollutants\nare kept low. A systematic review of the literature about the efficacy of portable air filters (or por-\ntable air cleaners) in real-world situations (i.e. not in a laboratory or occupational setting) showed\nthat they are efficient to reduce indoor particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration by 40-82%.\nAs for the improvement of health effects, the results indicate some health improvements, and\nmostly in healthy adults. However, the few studies available in the literature that focused mostly on efficacy, only included\nsmall number of participants - mostly health ones - and covered short-term time frames only.\nLong-term studies on susceptible population to air pollution impacts are lacking."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Can air filters be recommended as a public health measure?", "answer": "It would be premature to recommend the use of portable air filters as a public health measure for\nthree reasons : There is a lack of information on effectiveness in the real world, which depends on rates of\n    infiltration of outdoor air pollutants into the indoor environment and human activities. They may have adverse indoor and environmental impact, such as build-up of gaseous pollutants either generated indoors, like ozone produced by some electrostatic filters or due to\n    sealing measures (e.g. closing windows) for CO2, and noise. The high cost of maintenance (e.g. changing filters) and equitable access issues need to be\n    considered as limiting factors. The use of portable air filters might be proposed for people with preexisting conditions, such as\nCOPD, heart failure or lung transplants, who should stay at home and be protected from exposure\nto air pollution."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What is a respirator in the context of air pollution?", "answer": "A respirator is a mask that covers the nose and mouth and fits tightly to the face, which can filter\nout PM2.5 particles, including smoke or ash particles. Respirators have primarily been developed\nto protect workers in high exposure work places. Filtering facepiece respirators are made entirely\nof filter material and are the most common type of air-purifying particulate respirators. There are well-established occupational certifications, recommendations and protocols for respirator use. The general public should be cautious when purchasing products advertised online\nthat have not been assessed for conformity by e.g. Chinese National Standards (GB), European\nConformity (CE), the Japanese Industrial Standard or the US National Institute for Occupational\nSafety and Health (NIOSH) standard. Respirators that are filtering 95% of airborne particle are called N95 (the most popular name)\nin the USA following the NIOSH Standard but are called KN95 in China following the Chinese\nNational Standard, and FFP2 respirators in Europe following the European Conformity Standard.\nThese terms (e.g. N95 etc), which refer to the particle removal efficiency of respirators, has not\nbeen patented or copyrighted and can be used by any maker of masks, even without proper testing. Packaging should be examined for certification or approval by a known national or international authority."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Can respirators protect from air pollution in the occupational setting?", "answer": "According to occupational recommendations and protocols, there are five factors that ensure that\na respirator is effective : Putting it on correctly. Ensuring that it fits properly. Using it continuously during exposure. Replacing the respirator or the filter when it becomes saturated. Confirming that it has been approved to remove ≥ 95 % of particles. Because of differences in facial structures across the world, no one respirator can be guaranteed\nto fit all users. There are no commercial respirators designed for children (based on information\navailable as of February 2019). There is, to date. no information on the application of well-established occupational recommendations and protocols for respirator use by the public and who\nshould be the responsible authority on this. When respirators are properly selected and used, they reduce exposure to harmful inhalation\npollutants. However, those with underlying medical conditions such as respiratory disease need to\nbe cautious, as these issues could be exacerbated when using a respirator."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Do respirators protect from air pollution in real world situations?", "answer": "A systematic review of the literature about the efficacy of respirators use in reducing exposure to\r\nparticulate matter in real-world situations (i.e. not in a laboratory or occupational setting) showed\r\nlittle if any health improvements. However, there were few studies in the literature that focused\r\nmostly on efficacy, and these only included small numbers of participants - mostly health ones –\r\nand only covered short-term time frames. Most studies did not provide information on how well\r\nthe respirators worked or fitted, which might have biased the results. There is no evidence available\r\non the effectiveness of respirator use in the general population or on susceptible populations."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "Can respirators be recommended as a public health measure?", "answer": "Given the limited evidence on the effectiveness of respirators to protect health in real conditions\nof use by the general population, their use should not be recommended. Rather, the recommendation should be to continue and intensify action to reduce air pollutant emissions and to reduce\nor limit every day exposure when possible. The use of respirators is recommended or required in specific occupational situations. In the\ngeneral population they may be recommended under well-controlled procedures for short periods\nin situations such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, acute desert dust episodes or clean-up after a\ndisaster. Here again, a special caution is necessary for people with respiratory and cardiovascular\ndisease for whom it may not be advisable to use a respirator due to increased dead space, airway\nresistance and psychological stress."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "How equitable is it to recommend personal interventions?", "answer": "Breathing clean air is a human right. Responsibility for the provision of clean air lies within the society\r\nand must not be delegated to the individual, as the individual has very limited options of decreasing\r\nher/his own exposure. Moreover, placing the responsibility for reducing exposure to air pollution on\r\nindividuals raises important issues of equity in terms of individuals’ need and opportunities/ability to\r\nimplement the recommendations due to differential access to information and resources. Recommendations should account for the individual cultural, educational and socioeconomic\r\ncontext, the resources available to follow those recommendations, the information available to\r\nmake an informed decision, people’s perceived risk of harm from air pollution as compared with\r\ncompeting health risks and the basic human right to a sustainable livelihood. Effective actions by authorities could ease the pressure on individuals to reduce their own expo-\r\nsure. The actions include, most importantly, legislation to ensure clean air, but in the interim can\r\ninclude subsidies to individuals in the greatest need, in terms of both reducing exposure to air\r\npollution and accessing resources, to implement the recommended interventions."}
{"topic": "/air-pollution-personal-interventions-and-risk-communication", "question": "What is this the role of medical societies?", "answer": "Medical societies can play a central role in educating the public about the health effects of air pollution and in developing and distributing clinical guidelines, which might have to be region-specific\nand with inequity properly addressed. In guideline development and advocacy, medical societies should ensure that the responsibility for\nproviding a healthy environment is that of society, and every attempt to place the responsibility\non the individual must be prevented."}
{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "Why is the disease burden attributable to risk factors being estimated?", "answer": "For many health policy decisions regarding prevention and intervention, it is important to know which risk factors are most important for population health, so the available resources can be spent most efficiently to improve the health of entire populations. To this end, it is necessary to quantify the burden caused by diseases and injuries which can be attributed to known risk factors in a comprehensive and comparable way. This requires an integration of knowledge about the “dangerousness” of a risk factor (this is usually assessed as the relative risk for a specific disease-risk factor combination) and the “frequency and level of exposure” (how many people in a population are exposed to which quantities of the risk factor). Following the well-established method outlined below, disease burden from different risk factors such as lack of physical activity, smoking or air pollution can be calculated and compared and changes over time (for example after an intervention that reduced air pollution) can be assessed."}
{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "What is meant by attributable disease burden?", "answer": "The attributable burden is the share of the burden of disease that can be estimated to occur due to exposure to a particular risk factor. The disease burden (for example deaths, years of life lost or years lived with disability) attributable to a risk factor is the disease burden that would not have occurred if people had not been exposed to the risk factor in the past. Given that the basis of the information is all rooted in the past (exactly like in case of deriving the life-expectancy), the notion that the burden had not occurred without the exposure is based on several assumptions. The concept of attributable disease burden or the attributable risk fraction is schematically shown in the figure below."}
{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "What is the population attributable fraction?", "answer": "The attributable fraction is a standard concept of epidemiology. The population attributable fraction (PAF) is a useful measure as it quantifies the fraction of disease burden (for example years of life lost) attributable to a specific risk factor in a population in a way which is understandable and easy to communicate. The PAF signifies the proportion of ill health or deaths that could have potentially been prevented by removing the risk factor or by reducing it to an alternative level. It is used to calculate risk factor-attributable disease burden estimates. It provides a bridge between the size of a risk factor, as usually derived in epidemiological studies, and the prevalence of that risk factor in a given population. It provides a population perspective, relevant to policy making. The PAF can help guiding the choice of the most urgent interventions and policies particularly if one compares the PAF and the disease burden of various risk factors that are possibly amenable to prevention or intervention measures (1)."}
{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "How is the population attributable fraction calculated?", "answer": "Two types of information are needed to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF): the proportions of the population exposed to the risk factor (p i ) for each level of exposure, and the relative risk ( RR ) associated with exposure, usually based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses including the results of all relevant epidemiological studies complying with certain criteria. The RR provides the ratio of the probabilities of an outcome, e.g. to get a certain disease or to die, in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. A common form of the formula for estimating the PAF is the following. It can accommodate several exposure levels which a population can be exposed to (2): where p i is the proportion of the population exposed at exposure level i , p i '  is the counterfactual exposure distribution and RR i is the relative risk at exposure level i . The counterfactual exposure distribution is the exposure level with no or very low exposure to the risk factor and therefore no or very low associated disease risk (i.e., RR of 1). The counterfactual is often set at the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), which may or may not currently be attainable in practice. A simplified formula applicable to only two levels of exposure (exposed and unexposed) is the following (3) These formulas assume no confounding or effect modification. Only RRs from studies of high quality epidemiological should be used in such assessments.

{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "How is the attributable burden of disease due to a risk factor calculated?", "answer": "Comparative risk assessment methods are the preferred methods used to estimate the burden of disease in a population attributable to a risk factor. The following inputs are used for estimating the attributable disease burden: disease statistics for the population for the metric of interest (number of deaths, years of life lost [YLLs], years lived with disability [YLDs], or disability-adjusted life years [DALYs, the sum of YLLs and YLDs]), the counterfactual level of risk factor exposure which usually corresponds to an exposure where a minimum risk is incurred, the population attributable fraction (PAF), as described above, based on the distribution of the population into the various exposure levels for a risk factor, including the counterfactual exposure level, and the relative risk linking exposure and disease or other health outcomes. The attributable disease burden is then estimated by multiplying the total burden by the PAF for each relevant health outcome and by age and sex.

{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "Is this approach widely applied, accepted and tested?", "answer": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has been estimating the global burden of disease attributable to a risk factor using the described approach since about two decades . Since then, a very high number of peer-reviewed scientific articles and reports using the same methods have been published. The underlying methods have been described extensively (e.g., (5,6)). Other organizations and institutes have also been using these methods, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has been publishing burden of disease figures from a large list of risk factors in collaboration with many scientists from all over the world (7). The methods used in burden of disease assessments are in continuous discussion and improvement involving numerous scientists globally. This ensures a high-quality methodology used to estimate burden of disease. All assumptions used in such assessments need to be made transparent.

They however correspond to the state of the science including latest estimates on exposure and exposure-response relationships, provided that certain conditions apply. The following issues need to be carefully verified/considered and to be made transparent: (a) The causality of the respective exposure-disease pairs has been assessed and validated; (b) the combined relative risks from epidemiological studies need to be free from confounding and effect modification and should be applicable to the relevant population groups; (c) the exposure definition used in the relative risk and the exposure estimates need to correspond; and (d) the relative risk estimates used for estimating population attributable fractions (PAFs) generally need to stem from pooled analyses of the available evidence, such as from rigorously performed meta-analyses.

Exposure estimates may vary according to the assessment method used. Countries may have additional exposure data and a finer resolution compared to global assessments. Furthermore, epidemiological information is accruing with time, allowing estimates to improve in precision. All estimates should be fully documented in terms of assumptions made and data sources used. Estimates should refer to publicly available and easily accessible exposure estimates and exposure-response relationships should be based on published meta-analyses to ensure transparency of estimates and allow for comparison between studies."}
{"topic": "/environmental-health-estimations-of-attributable-burden-of-disease-due-to-a-risk-factor", "question": "What do the population attributable fraction (PAF) and the estimated attributable disease burden NOT cover?", "answer": "The population attributable fractions (PAF) and attributable burden of disease assessments refer to whole populations and express the fraction of disease burden that could have been avoided if exposure were removed, but do not allow the designation of affected individuals. This means that it is not possible to determine who died earlier or contracted disease because of exposure to the risk factor at the individual level. The estimated attributable disease burden may not cover the true full disease burden that is caused by the risk factor. Reasons are that not all risk factor – disease links and not all exposures may have been quantified and therefore risk factor burden of disease assessments are often based on scarce evidence.  Also the chosen definition of the counterfactual affects the size of the estimated attributable disease burden. The exposure-response relationship is often based on intervention studies, such as randomized controlled trials. which may underestimate the true exposure-response relationship for example in case of imperfect intervention implementation or compliance.

{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "How can HIA be used in projects, programmes and policies?", "answer": "HIA has mostly been used on projects, but it has been used on policies and programmes also. This ability to be used in a wide variety of settings is one of the strengths of the HIA approach. However the use of HIA at the strategic level, during the development of policies is one of the most exciting aspects of HIA. It can be used for policy development at local, regional, national, or international levels. Funders can also use HIAs to ensure that projects and programmes consider health, for example, the Asian Development Bank has guidelines for HIA use (Birley 1992)."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "How can HIA assist policy development?", "answer": "Within the policy process, HIA is best used early on, while there is still maximum time to influence the policy as it develops. Many of the changes that occur within a policy occur during its development, well before it is put out for formal consultation. A close and trusting relationship with policy makers is obviously required to achieve this. The HIA influences development simply by the policy makers knowing that health will be assessed, and therefore they consider health issues more explicitly when developing the policy, and the policy maker having access to people with health knowledge on a regular basis to discuss issues with (both formally and informally)."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "How can HIA bring policies and people together?", "answer": "HIA is a crosscutting approach that requires many stakeholders to be involved. This helps to develop partnerships between people and organisations – getting people together from diverse backgrounds to begin talking about health (and subsequently other topics!). Partnership working is strengthened by the HIA approach. This way of working also encourages people to see links between the policy being assessed, and other policies being implemented or developed. Often, time and resources are saved when such linkages are made, and policies are strengthened."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "How does HIA provide information for decision-makers?", "answer": "Decision-makers can also use the HIA to help decide between multiple policy options that are put forward to them, or to assist in deciding on policy changes based on the HIA recommendations."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What is the role of public in HIA?", "answer": "The local community is a stakeholder that is included within most HIAs. Decision-makers often want to include the perceptions and opinions of the local community within policies [link to why use hia] and an HIA can help to address any community concerns. Decision-makers can then act secure in the knowledge that community views have been represented in the information they have been provided."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "Can HIA help address policy-making requirements?", "answer": "There are many requirements that policy makers must meet, at international, national and local levels. There is guidance/requirements to work across sectors; consider sustainability; reduce inequalities; and consider the health impact/well-being/quality of life on local communities. HIA has the ability to assist policy makers with these requirements."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What other factors influence policy?", "answer": "There are many influences on the policy process and many different information sources feeding in, with HIA being just one of these. This is why it is so important to involve decision-makers early on in the HIA process, to alert them to the upcoming HIA recommendations and ensure there are no surprises for decision-makers. Other than by HIA, health can be taken into account in the development of policies and programmes by: Joint committees, inter-sectoral councils, working groups, etc, Audits, providing auditors understand the link between health and other policy areas), Strategies and programmes that cut across policy areas (and include health), Within environmental impact assessment (if health is addressed), Budget and planning processes (if health is considered), Individual action of officials to influence other policies, Memorandum of understandings, and Integrated appraisal and screening tools."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "How can HIA influence outcomes?", "answer": "HIA looks for negative impacts of developments (to prevent or reduce them) and because HIA is often undertaken prospectively – looking into the future – it offers the unique advantage of preventing damage from occurring. But HIA also looks for positive health impacts of proposals. This often provides decision-makers with options to strengthen and extend these features of the proposal."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What are some of the barriers preventing use of HIA?", "answer": "Lack of relevant skills and expertise Contact your local WHO regional office for people in your area who are undertaking HIA. Develop skills by taking part in training and reading more information on this site. Lack of awareness and understanding Learn more below about factors most suited to your organization/sector and use these in awareness raising activity. Send people to this website for a quick introduction. Lack of resources This applies to every area of work. If priority is placed on HIA, resources will follow. Using rapid (often only in days/weeks) appraisal techniques, and only doing a desk-top HIA (where community consultation does not occur) are other ways to undertake an HIA when resources are limited. Making use of information and evidence from already completed HIAs is also useful. No recognized tools or methods See the Health impact assessment methods and the included databases and tools for a counter argument to this. Lack of political support Learn more below about factors most suited to your organization/sector and use these in awareness raising activity. Use completed HIAs from the database to show how HIA has been used in other countries/organizations. Be aware of the existing interests of groups that can benefit from promoting some specific projects or business as usual situations. Lack of time HIA does take time, but it is worth it. HIAs can be done in a short space of time, but rapid HIAs still need a concentrated time commitment from people. A question that needs asking is, “What are the possible consequences of not doing an HIA, particularly if problems surface later, and will a lack of time be a suitable defence if the policy is challenged publicly or legally?” If an HIA is not undertaken, the proposal runs the risk of time lost later. Other priorities get in the way Learn more below about factors most suited to your organization/sector and use these in awareness raising activity. Use completed HIAs from the database to show how HIA has been used in other countries/organizations. Gaps in the evidence base There are gaps, but the use of the best available evidence is better than not using any evidence at all. HIA draws on the best available evidence and summaries are being done to draw evidence together."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "How can health be integrated into environmental assessments?", "answer": "WHO provides support in integrating health into environmental assessments, for example providing policy briefs and compilation of examples to learn from practice (e.g. in the waste management). For example: Health impact assessment of steel plant activities in Taranto, Italy Learning from practice: case studies of health in strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact assessment across the WHO European Region"}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What are some of the steps in decision and policy-making?", "answer": "1. During the scoping stage of HIA, explore the policy’s context by answering the questions: What is at stake (proposals, potential health impacts, other interests)? How does the policy come about (is there a consultation of stakeholders and citizens or is decision-making undertaken by one central actor) and how can HIA connect with this process? Who are involved in the policy making process (decision-maker(s), stakeholders, researchers and other experts, citizens)? What does the institutional context look like (formal decision-making procedures, communication rules, and informal relations between the several actors involved)?This exploration can identify opportunities for the HIA to link up with decision-makers and stakeholders who have similar interests. Also, the HIA has a better chance of anticipating difficulties in the process, and being able to develop strategies to address these difficulties. 2. Produce an HIA that has a plan for active dissemination of HIA messages at key stages. Announcing the HIA (when it begins, and at other key steps, etc.), disseminating preliminary findings, and using discussion groups will help to put health interests on the agenda of agencies. These steps are equally as important as producing a sound report. HIA practitioners realize that the process does not stop when the report has been produced and the decision made. 3. HIA practitioners should try to establish long-term relationships with decision-makers. Gaining the commitment of the health authority/department will help achieve this during intersectoral policy development. 4. Where appropriate, include a wide variety of stakeholders in the process, and draw on the best available qualitative and quantitative evidence. Policy makers appreciate these HIA values as they also underpin their own work. The inclusion of local communities provides policy makers with data and information that is typically hard to get, which is grounded in the realities of the local environment and is rich in experience. 5. Ensure that a longer-term follow-up of the HIA can be made to determine the actual impacts from the policy or project on the health awareness among others, on the health determinants and finally on health itself. The appropriateness of these different levels of evaluation is discussed in Evaluating your HIA .

{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What are the values HIA is based on?", "answer": "HIA is based on four values that link the HIA to the policy environment in which it is being undertaken: democracy – allowing people to participate      in the development and implementation of policies, programmes or projects      that may impact on their lives; equity – HIA assesses the distribution      of impacts from a proposal on the whole population, with a particular      reference to how the proposal will affect vulnerable people (in terms of      age, gender, ethnic background and socio-economic status); sustainable development – that both short and long term      impacts are considered, along with the obvious, and less obvious impacts;      and ethical use of evidence – the best available quantitative      and qualitative evidence must be identified and used in the assessment. A      wide variety of evidence should be collected using the best possible      methods."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What are the reasons for using HIA?", "answer": "Promotes cross-sectoral working HIA is a participatory approach that helps people from multiple sectors to work together. working. A participatory approach that values the views of the community The HIA can be used as a framework to implicate stakeholders in a meaningful way, allowing their messages to be heard. The best available evidence is provided to decision-makers The purpose of an HIA is to provide decision-makers with a set of evidence-based recommendations about the proposal. Improves health and reduces inequalities HIA uses a wide model of health and works across sectors to provide a systematic approach for assessing how the proposal affects a population. It is a positive approach HIA looks not only for negative impacts (to prevent or reduce them), but also for impacts favourable to health. Appropriate for policies, strategies, plans, programmes and projects HIA is suitable for use at many different levels. HIA can be used on projects, programmes (groupings of projects) and policies, though it has most commonly been used on projects. Timeliness Experienced HIA practitioners can work within most time frames, undertaking comprehensive (longer) or rapid (shorter) HIAs. Links with sustainable development and resource management If the HIA is undertaken at a sufficiently early stage in the project process, it can be used as a key tool for sustainable development."}
{"topic": "/the-role-of-health-impact-assessment-(hia)-in-decision-making", "question": "What are international policies and regulations for HIA?", "answer": "Several international policies and regulations make provisions for HIA or recommend its use, such as: Environmental impact assessment      and strategic environmental assessment In almost all countries globally environmental assessment regulation      exist. Internationally the Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context of      the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and its Protocol      on SEA build a framework for EIA and SEA which is supposed to be open for      all UN Member countries. Importantly, the Protocol on SEA requires      consultations to be conducted with health authorities on the likely      significant effects on human health (Article 9). Furthermore, regulations      of the European Union such as the SEA Directive 2001/42/EC on the      assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the      environment and the EIA Directive 2014/52/EU on the assessment of the      effects of certain public and private projects on the environment require      that the environmental assessment of a proposal identifies, describes and      assesses direct and indirect significant effects of a project on factors      such as: population and human health; biodiversity […]; land, soil, water, air and climate; material assets, cultural heritage and the landscape; the interaction between the factors referred to in points (a) to (d). Article 152 of the Amsterdam      Treaty The Treaty calls for the European Union (EU) to examine the possible      impact of major policies on health. The treaty states that \"A high      level of health protection shall be ensured in connection with the      formulation and implementation of all Community policies and all Community      measures\". The European Commission's Health Strategy proposal states      that policies must ensure that public health aspects be considered in all      EU decisions and actions, therefore health impact assessments should be conducted. Health21 – Health for all The 51 countries comprising the WHO European Region have a common policy      framework for health development, which outlines strategies to transform      national policies into practical operational programmes at the local      level. After consultations with Member States and several important      organizations in the Region, four main strategies for action were chosen      to ensure that scientific, economic, social and political sustainability      drive the implementation of Health21 . The first is that      \"multisectoral strategies tackle the determinants of health, taking      into account physical, economic, social, cultural and gender perspectives      and ensuring the use of health impact assessment\". Environmental Health      Conferences The 3rd ministerial conference on environmental health, held in London in      1999, recognized access to information, public participation and access to      justice in environment and health as important issues. Several countries      supported the idea of a protocol on strategic environment and health      impact assessment, and the theme was submitted to the following      environment and health conference in Budapest, in 2004. Health impact      assessment was also mentioned in the following conferences in Parma      (2010), Ostrava (2017) and Budapest (2023). Libreville Declaration In 2008, the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment in      Africa encouraged governments to integrate health and the environment      within public policies, poverty reduction strategies and national      development plans. The implementation of health and environment      intersectoral programmes at all levels is considered one of the decisive      factors that may lead to the achievement of the United Nations      Millennium Development Goals."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "Why was the Global vector control response 2017–2030 (GVCR) developed?", "answer": "Cognizant of recent major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus disease, Member States at the 139th WHO Executive Board meeting in May 2016 requested the Director-General to devise an appropriate response."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "What is new about the GVCR?", "answer": "The GVCR sets out a new strategy to strengthen vector control worldwide through increased capacity, improved surveillance, better coordination and integrated action."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "How was the GVCR developed?", "answer": "Development commenced in June 2016 through a fast-tracked and broadly consultative process that was co-led by the WHO Global Malaria Programme, the WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. The strategic approach was welcomed by Member States at the Seventieth World Health Assembly in May 2017, and a dedicated resolution was adopted (WHA70.16)."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "How were the GVCR goals, milestones and targets generated?", "answer": "These were aligned with Sustainable Development Goal target 3.3 (1) , and were formulated on the basis of a comprehensive review of relevant WHO global and regional strategies, plans, frameworks and resolutions on vector-borne diseases. These included: the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 as adopted by the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015 the Global strategy for dengue prevention and control 2012-2020 resolution WHA66.12 on Neglected tropical diseases adopted by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly in May 2013. Targets were based on background modelling that included projections of vector-borne disease burden and risk over the strategic timeframe in order to develop reasonable and achievable targets. These goals, milestones and targets are not intended to replace or override established disease-specific goals, such as for malaria or dengue."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "How will the global targets defined in the GVCR apply to individual countries or regions?", "answer": "GVCR provides strategic guidance to all Member States and development partners for sustainable vector surveillance and control. It is anticipated that the milestones and targets outlined in the GVCR will be adapted across regions and at national level based on the local situation (for example, diseases, capacity, interventions, and evidence). Countries will establish their own national or subnational targets in reference to national vector-borne disease strategies. Regional strategies and targets may also be developed."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "How will the GVCR be implemented?", "answer": "Priority activities have been defined for action at national and regional levels. These will need to be supported through broader activities to be undertaken at global level, including those to be undertaken by the WHO Secretariat as well as other partners such as those involved in research and development of new vector control tools, technologies and approaches."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "Are the national priority activities to be implemented only at national level?", "answer": "In many countries, there is vast geographical and seasonal variation in vector-borne diseases. While GVCR advocates for reforms in national vector control structures, planning and action are not limited to national level. The GVCR emphasizes the need for locally-adapted action, with many of the priority activities to be implemented at provincial and local levels."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "What are the major changes that are expected at national level in line with the GVCR? Are all countries expected to have one integrated vector control department?", "answer": "The required changes at national level will be determined through a comprehensive national vector control needs assessment. National needs assessments are one of the priority activities identified in the GVCR for immediate implementation. It is anticipated that through these needs assessments countries will identify areas that require restructuring/re-orientation for effective vector control programmes to integrate activities and increase efficiency. WHO is currently developing a framework to inform the development of these national vector control needs assessments."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "How does the GVCR differ from what is already defined for integrated vector management?", "answer": "Integrated vector management is defined as a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. The GVCR builds on the integrated vector management approach with renewed focus on human capacity at national and subnational levels, as well as strengthened surveillance, infrastructure and management systems. It includes reorienting relevant government programmes around proactive strategies to control new and emerging threats."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "How does the GVCR link with One Health concept?", "answer": "One Health recognizes that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. The goal of One Health is to encourage the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines – working locally, nationally, and globally – to achieve the best health for people, animals, and our environment. A One Health approach is important because six out of every ten infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals. In many parts of the world, several vector-borne diseases such as dengue and yellow fever have a sylvatic transmission cycle in the forests which sustain the reservoir of the disease."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "What is the linkage of the GVCR with the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR)?", "answer": "An IHR network of country-level focal points and coordination of expertise will play a vital role in prevention and control of potential outbreaks. Vector surveillance and control will be strengthened at all ports of entry as per IHR requirements. Active leadership along with improved coordination and strengthened human capacity at national and subnational levels in accordance with GVCR will foster productive engagement and collaboration in the shared vision of vector-borne diseases reduction."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "What are the implications of the GVCR for research and its funding?", "answer": "The GVCR calls for increased basic and applied research and innovation as a foundation for strengthening vector control. This encompasses the establishment and maintenance of appropriate capacity within national vector-borne disease programmes in order to collect and use data to inform implementation. It includes the establishment of a national research agenda appropriate to the needs of the programme to support evidence-based vector control. While it will also advocate for the development of new tools, this does not extend to financing and coordination for product research and development, which is adequately addressed through initiatives such as the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development, as was discussed under agenda item 13.5 of the Seventieth World Health Assembly."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "Is it anticipated that Ministries of Health will be able to make cost savings through integration across disease programmes?", "answer": "Given the essential strengthening of health workforce and infrastructure that is outlined in GVCR, it is likely that in many countries there will need to be some initial increase in investment with a focus on programme re-orientation and sustainability. However, the boost in technical capacity and essential resources and locally-adaptive vector control implementation will be more efficient to detect and manage any possible increases in cases or pockets of outbreaks. This is likely to lead to more effective use of vector control tools for maximum impact – thereby protecting these investments in the mid- to long-term. Prevention of outbreaks of vector-borne diseases is expected to be highly cost-effective to all countries."}
{"topic": "/neglected-tropical-diseases-global-vector-control-response-2017-2030", "question": "Who is expected to fund implementation of the GVCR?", "answer": "GVCR has been formulated with inputs from Member States and other experts, including existing multilateral and bilateral donors. GVCR funding will depend on country capacity to re-orient programmes with a greater level of accountability, improved management and to leverage regional cooperation mechanisms. It is envisaged that the clear recognition of the importance of the GVCR at the World Health Assembly will lead to greater advocacy for and attract more resources in a time-limited manner based on the identified needs and activities."}
{"topic": "/q-a-the-paediatric-environmental-history", "question": "What is children’s environmental health?", "answer": "Children’s environmental health is the discipline that studies how environmental exposures in early life – chemical, nutritional, and social – influence health and development in childhood and across the entire human life span. It emerged as a branch of paediatric medicine in the second half of the twentieth century and draws primarily on the fields of epidemiology, toxicology, occupational medicine and the social sciences. The discipline considers children’s special and unique sensitivities to environmental threats. There are four broad categories that are considered when assessing children’s health and environmental risks: different and unique exposures developmental physiologies, including the central nervous system longer life expectancies allowing for more time to manifest a disease with a long latency period dependency upon adults to provide a safe and healthy environment. Children’s sensitivities should be considered when assessing health risks and can provide valuable insight on treating and preventing diseases linked to the environment."}
{"topic": "/q-a-the-paediatric-environmental-history", "question": "What is the paediatric environmental history (PEH)?", "answer": "The PEH is a primary tool to recognize, treat and prevent environmental-related diseases and health conditions. It is a series of basic, concise questions that assists health professionals to identify children’s exposure to environmental risks. The PEH is not a single, one-time endeavour, but part of a comprehensive medical history that is updated often and used for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up as appropriate. Just as questions about growth and development, medical conditions and a child’s social environments are standard and updated regularly, so too should questions about their physical environment. Asking the right questions about a patient’s physical environment requires appropriate knowledge of local, regional and global environmental hazards, their importance in different life-stages and local access to resources for intervention. The primary goal of the PEH is to systematize a set of basic, concise questions into both well and sick paediatric health care and tailor them to local situations, resources, needs and capacities."}
{"topic": "/q-a-the-paediatric-environmental-history", "question": "How will the PEH improve children’s health?", "answer": "The regular use of the PEH by health care providers will enable more effective primary care of children, their families and communities, improve the quality of medical surveillance, and contribute to the prevention of environmental-related diseases and health conditions. Health care providers have specific roles and responsibilities in recording environmental and health data and can use the PEH to: recognize clinical, subclinical and potential effects of environmental risk factors on children's health; take a thorough exposure history by asking appropriate questions and recording the information; contribute to research and knowledge generation. Data on the environment and health that have been collected, collated and analysed can provide valuable information that may fill knowledge gaps and contribute to research; inform the community and decision-makers about environmental threats to child health, and advocate for change to improve conditions and prevent further harm; and work to prevent, reduce and eliminate harmful environmental exposure, consequently preventing related health conditions."}
{"topic": "/q-a-the-paediatric-environmental-history", "question": "Who takes the PEH, where, when and how?", "answer": "The decision about who takes the PEH depends on the characteristics of the local health system, availability of health workers and other resources. As it is an ongoing effort, different methods and individuals may be used depending on the circumstances and reasons for the visit. People who take the PEH may include: health care professionals working with infants, children and adolescents including paediatricians, family doctors, nurses, primary health care workers, residents, medical students, and midwives; social workers or environmental officers who visit the home, school, playground or other places where children spend time; and self-administered parent or caregiver questionnaires may be possible in some settings and can provide a starting point for discussion during clinical visits. Environmentally trained staff in health care facilities can offer advantages, as they can identify and assess any potential threats in a child’s environment, inform health care providers and authorities, and educate parents, teachers and communities."}
{"topic": "/q-a-the-paediatric-environmental-history", "question": "What are the key areas covered by the PEH?", "answer": "The areas covered in each PEH will differ depending on the local context, environment risks and the individual context of patients. Key areas to consider include: local environmental hazards      including physical, biological and chemical risks and their sources. Some      common examples include pesticides, lead, mercury, waste management,      water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, vectors of disease and air      pollution; where, how and when are children      exposed to environmental hazards in their context? Common questions may      ask about the child’s home or school, activities they engage in such as      sports or work, the type and origin of foods and water, the presence of      animals, and the parents work; and past medical history and events,      including past diagnoses or any unexplained health issues."}
{"topic": "/q-a-the-paediatric-environmental-history", "question": "What is the WHO’s Green Page?", "answer": "The WHO’s Green Page was developed to provide a starting point for local PEH templates. It represents a place to record a core set of basic environmental details. It can be used as a starting point for developing a local PEH that is appropriate in a particular location, clinic, country, or setting. Some key features of the Green Page include: the combination of      potential environmental risks, including elements that are essential      resources for prevention of exposure; it can be completed using      several information sources, including clinical and personal observations; the template contains      a space to estimate the risk qualitatively - the \"ABC\" of      environmental risks. The ABC assessment requires training and the      development of specific criteria using intersectoral expertise, as well as      diverse sources of data; and it offers inspiration      for possible lines of enquiry, innovation and data collection in a variety      of setting. WHO publishes a training package for the health sector , including a specific module on how to develop and use a paediatric environmental history . In 2024, UNICEF and WHO published a joint online introductory course for healthcare workers on children’s environmental health, including a section dedicated to the PEH."}
{"topic": "/childrens-environmental-health-preventing-and-managing-childhood-diseases", "question": "How many childhood diseases are linked to the environment?", "answer": "A growing number of diseases in children are linked to unhealthy and degraded environments. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) analysis in 2016 found that more than 28%, or almost 1.6 million, of all deaths in children under 5 were linked to the environment. Many of the leading causes of mortality in children have strong environmental components including: respiratory infections, including pneumonia, which are linked household and ambient air pollution, and second-hand smoke exposure neonatal conditions, including prematurity, are linked to maternal exposure to household air pollution, some chemicals and second hand smoke, as well as inadequate water and sanitation in birth settings inadequate drinking-water, poor access to sanitation and hygiene facilities, and open defecation are strongly linked to diarrhoeal diseases malaria and other vector-borne diseases unintentional injuries, such as poisonings and burns, are linked to unsafely stored and unlabelled chemicals, and the use of polluting cooking, heating and lighting technologies and fuels in homes."}
{"topic": "/childrens-environmental-health-preventing-and-managing-childhood-diseases", "question": "How can we improve children’s environmental health?", "answer": "Health care professionals have critical roles to play in maintaining and stimulating change that will protect children’s health from environmental hazards and associated diseases. It is essential that healthcare professionals are trained to recognize environmental hazards and diagnose, treat and prevent childhood diseases linked to these hazards. This includes paediatricians, family doctors, nurses, primary healthcare workers, students and other healthcare workers. Healthcare workers should be trained using harmonized training materials that are adapted to the specific needs of countries, local contexts, resource constraints and professional groups. Additionally, healthcare professionals are trusted members of our societies and are powerful voices for change at the local and national levels. Healthcare professionals can use their knowledge to work with government agencies to recognize local environmental hazards, develop and implement sustainable policies to address and improve environmental health issues in their context, and support actions that reduce local environmental health threats."}
{"topic": "/childrens-environmental-health-preventing-and-managing-childhood-diseases", "question": "What are the benefits of training health care providers?", "answer": "Healthcare professionals are powerful advocates for change. Ensuring that healthcare professionals are trained on children’s environmental health can: increase healthcare professionals’ understanding of the influence of environmental factors on children’s health and improve interventions to prevent hazardous exposure; improved the timeliness and quality of diagnosis and management of environmental-related health and developmental effects; increase the capacity of healthcare professionals to discuss and share knowledge with patients, their families and caregivers, communities, educators and policy-makers; elevate healthcare professionals’ skills to advocate for children’s environmental health; improve data collection and research on children’s environmental health."}
{"topic": "/childrens-environmental-health-preventing-and-managing-childhood-diseases", "question": "What is the WHO training package for the health sector on children’s health and the environment?", "answer": "The WHO training package is collection of modules with internationally harmonized information and peer-reviewed materials to enable healthcare workers to be trained, and become trainers of their peers and colleagues. The modules include extensive notes and references, case studies and self-evaluation tools, backed up by manuals and guidelines. A selected team of experienced professionals from more than 15 countries, the International Paediatric Association (IPA) and selected NGOs participated in its development and preparation. Since the first iteration of the training package, selected modules have undergone multiple revisions to ensure their accuracy and relevance. Additional modules have been added to the package to address emerging environmental health issues, including e-waste and endocrine disrupting chemicals."}
{"topic": "/childrens-environmental-health-preventing-and-managing-childhood-diseases", "question": "What issues are covered in the WHO training package?", "answer": "The WHO training package consists of more than 30 modules. It can also be used to create subpackages on specific issues of concern, for example chemicals. The training package includes modules on: children’s unique vulnerabilities to physical, chemical and biological environmental hazards, important sources of exposure and primary routes of exposure; children’s health and developmental effects linked to environmental hazards, including chemicals such as lead, mercury and pesticides, ambient and household air pollution, and inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene; specific environmental issues of concern, including climate change and e-waste, and their effects on children’s health, development and futures. Each module includes case studies from a particular context, interventions that have been undertaken to improve children’s environmental health and analysis of the outcomes. The training package includes a dedicated module on The paediatric environmental history: a tool for healthcare providers . This module trains healthcare providers to develop and use a localized paediatric environmental history to recognize, treat and prevent environmental-related diseases and health conditions in children."}
{"topic": "/childrens-environmental-health-preventing-and-managing-childhood-diseases", "question": "What is the UNICEF-WHO Introductory course on children’s environmental health?", "answer": "In 2024, UNICEF and WHO collaborated to produce a free, interactive and online course for frontline healthcare workers on children’s environmental health. The course is based on the content in the WHO training package on children’s environmental health for health care providers – but unlike the package the UNICEF-WHO course is an interactive, self-paced course that learners can complete on their own. At the end of this course participants should be able to: describe the influences of      environmental factors on children’s health, development and      well-being evaluate children’s unique      vulnerability to environmental hazards recognize signs, symptoms and      diseases linked to existing and emerging environmental risk factors take a paediatric environmental      history identify and access information      on paediatric environmental threats discuss the environmental risks      proficiently with patients, families, policy-makers, educators and the      community, providing understandable, concise information about potential      threats and risk-reduction strategies.

{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What is the aim of the ambient air quality database?", "answer": "The aim of WHO’s database 5 th update is three-fold: to compile measurements of air quality that can be used in assessing population exposure to air pollution. The data on particulate matter compiled in this database are directly used as inputs to model the Sustainable Development Goal 11.6.2 indicator\r\n        – air quality in cities – for which WHO is the custodial agency; to raise awareness on air pollution and its impact on health; and to provide a snapshot of air quality monitoring in countries."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What information does the ambient air quality database include?", "answer": "Included in the ambient air quality database are annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM 10 or PM 2.5 ) – which is an important indicator of long-term air quality and of health risks – and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), based on daily measurements or data which could be aggregated into annual means. In a few exceptional cases, where annual means could not be calculated, measurements covering a more limited part of the year were used. To present air quality that is largely representative for human exposure, only measurements characterized as urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas were used. Stations characterized as particular hot spots or exclusively industrial areas were not included, unless they were contained in reported city means and could not be dissociated."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What are the key findings about the database?", "answer": "The great majority of cities worldwide exceed WHO’s air quality guideline levels. The WHO global air quality guidelines report recommended PM 10 maximum annual mean levels of 15 µg/m 3 , 5 µg/m 3 for PM 2.5 and 10 µg/m 3 for NO 2 . Globally, only a few of the monitored cities and towns currently meet the WHO guideline values. These tend to be clustered in high-income countries. Based on the monitored cities and towns, air quality is poorest in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions, followed by the African countries. Based on extrapolations of these data, more than half of the urban population live in cities that exceed by more than 6 times the recommended levels of fine particulate matter set out by the WHO air quality guidelines. Additionally, only around 17% of the total urban population assessed live in cities and towns where the air quality complies with such levels. The fifth air quality database – the largest of its kind – covers over 6000 cities/human settlements, mostly cities, in 117 countries, and indicates where air pollution levels and the related health risks are higher. The aim of this updated database is not to rank cities or countries but to reflect the monitoring efforts undertaken in those countries. WHO has brought together this information on ambient air quality collected by cities and towns worldwide to raise awareness and facilitate adequate responses to protect public health from the adverse impacts of outdoor air pollution."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What has changed since the last compilation of the WHO database?", "answer": "The WHO air quality database introduces for the first time ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), as well as measurements of particulate matter with diameters equal or smaller than 10 μm (PM 10 ) or 2.5 μm (PM 2.5 ), from an additional 2000-plus cities and towns."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What is particulate matter and what its primary sources?", "answer": "Particulate matter (PM) consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, secondary organic aerosols, sea salt, black carbon, mineral dust and water. PM can originate from many different sources, such as residential fuel burning, transport, power plants, agriculture, waste burning, industry and natural sources. PM may be emitted directly or may be part of secondary processes in the atmosphere. PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution, and epidemiological studies have linked PM exposure to a variety of health effects. It affects more people than any other pollutant."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What are the health impacts from PM?", "answer": "While particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less (≤ PM 10 ) can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs, the even more health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, (≤ PM 2.5 ). PM 2.5 can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What is nitrogen dioxide NO2 and what are its primary sources?", "answer": "Nitrogen dioxide is a strong oxidant and an important atmospheric trace gas, not only because of its effect on health but also because it has a potential direct role in global climate change and is a precursor of ozone and particulate matter. Nitrogen dioxide primarily originates from anthropogenic fossil fuel (oil and gas) combustion, such as transport, power plants, industry and agriculture. NO 2 is an especially good proxy indicator for traffic and is thus especially common in urban areas."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What are the health impacts from NO2?", "answer": "NO 2 has an impact on the respiratory system, leading to symptoms such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing. It can also cause respiratory diseases (particularly asthma), increase hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms, as well as increased susceptibility to respiratory infections."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "This is the 5th time the AQ database has been updated. What trends can be seen since the start of this process?", "answer": "The number of measurements has multiplied by 6 since 2011, which indicates that an increasing number of governments recognize the threat to health posed by air pollution and how important it is to measure and communicate about air quality. New technologies (e.g., low-cost sensors) and techniques to assess population exposure (e.g., modelling and data fusion with various sources of information) have developed and provided important alternatives. Data are thus increasingly available, including from civil society (2) . Follow-up actions to reduce emissions in a sustainable way have been slower."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What policies or interventions should cities consider to ensure air pollution below WHO limits?", "answer": "Air pollution has no boundaries and neither its sources nor impacts are limited to cities, at least for particulate matter. Monitoring air quality levels and origins is the first important step, as sources of air pollution are context-specific and so are the solutions. Actions is thus needed at different geographical levels, for example local, national, regional and international. Intersectoral policies aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants in transport, land-use planning and energy should be encouraged."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "How was this information collected and organized in this database?", "answer": "The primary source of data in the ambient air pollution database includes official reporting from countries to WHO, official national and sub-national reports, or national institutes or governmental websites reporting measurements of PM 10 or PM 2.5 and NO 2 . Additional sources of air pollution measurements include other UN agencies, other development agencies, peer-reviewed journal articles, the regional networks such as air quality e-reporting from the European Environment Agency for Europe, and ground measurements compiled in the framework of the Global Burden of Disease project."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "Is tackling air pollution necessary to also address the climate crisis?", "answer": "On top of carbon dioxide (CO2), the other main sources of climate change are short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), such as black carbon (BC) which is a component of particulate matter, methane (CH 4 ), and ground-level ozone (O 3 ). Policies that improve air quality are fundamental to reduce the impacts of the climate crisis through, for example, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and its environmental and health effects. Policies that reduce climate change and improve environmental conditions have the potential for huge health co-benefits. For example, an increase of 7% in total clean energy investment for the period 2012–2040 could prevent 1.7 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and 1.6 million deaths from household pollution by 2040."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What are some of the major sources or causes of ambient air pollution?", "answer": "Both mobile sources (i.e., motorized vehicles) and stationary sources (i.e., smoke stacks) make significant contributions to ambient (outdoor) air pollution. Some of the major sources include exhaust fumes from vehicles, emissions from manufacturing facilities (e.g., factories) and power generation (e.g., smoke stacks of coal-fired power plants). In settlements where residential use of coal and wood for cooking and heating is permitted, the emissions from households using these fuels can make an important contribution to the levels of ambient air pollution. The contribution of natural sources of air pollution (e.g., desert dust) is also relevant."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "WHO alerts regularly on the number of deaths caused by air pollution. How are these estimates calculated?", "answer": "The number of deaths caused by air pollution is estimated based on the air quality levels people are exposed to and the increased risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that are incurred at those levels. The air quality levels are estimated from a combination of satellite information, chemical transport models and ground measurements of air quality, and the increased risks come from epidemiological studies. The methods are explained in detail on our web site ( https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/exposure-air-pollution )."}
{"topic": "/who-s-fifth-who-air-quality-database-of-over-6000-cities-updated-april-2022", "question": "What is WHO doing to tackle air pollution?", "answer": "WHO monitors trends in exposure and health risks associated with air pollution, reflected by its role as  custodial agency for the global monitoring of air pollution-related SDGs (3.9.1, 7.1.2, and 11.6.2). WHO develops evidence-based recommendations on what can be considered safe levels of air pollution. This normative guidance is found in its air quality guidelines like the recently updated WHO air quality guidelines: global update 2021 or the WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion (documents available here ). These often serve as the basis for formulating national standards and policies for air quality and energy access. WHO has a global communications campaign called BreatheLife. It is a partnership of WHO, UN Environment and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to reduce short-lived climate pollutants that aims to increase awareness and action on air pollution by governments and individuals  (see www.breathelife2030.org ). WHO’s Urban Health Initiative has been providing  a model for the health sector to contribute to healthy urban planning and policies. This model has focussed on cross-sector consultations, health sector training, policy-scenario modelling, advocacy and communications (link to UHI reports ?). WHO develops training material on air pollution and health that specifically targets the health workforce, for example clinicians and community health workers. WHO develops and pilots a number of tools and resources to support countries, cities and regions address the health impacts from air pollution by engaging in multisectoral activities such as: a web-based tool, AirQ+ , which estimates health impacts from varying levels of pollutant exposure; the Clean Household Energy  Solutions Toolkit (CHEST) to support the development of clean household energy policies and the implementation of the WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion , including tools for stakeholder mapping, monitoring and evaluation, and engaging the health community; the Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) to assess walking and cycling interventions; a Carbon Reduction Benefits on Health (CaRBonH) calculation tool that allows quantification of the physical and economic consequences for human health achieved through improvements in country-level air quality from domestic carbon reductions; and the GreenUr tool to raise importance of green space and health."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "What is dengue fever and severe dengue?", "answer": "Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are 4 serotypes of the virus that cause dengue. These are known as DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. Most dengue infections are mild and may not get noticed. Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication which can develop from dengue infections. You can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the day. It is estimated that over 50–100 million cases of dengue occur worldwide each year, and 4 billion people live in dengue-endemic countries."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "Where does the disease occur?", "answer": "Dengue is mainly transmitted by a mosquito ( Aedes aegypti ) and is distributed across all tropical countries. Ae. aegypti and other species such as Ae. albopictus are highly adaptive and their combined distribution can spread dengue higher up north across Europe or North America during summer. Travellers already infected with the virus also spread the disease when bitten by the local Aedes mosquito population. Dengue outbreaks can occur anytime, as long as the mosquitoes are still active. However, in general, high humidity and temperature favour mosquito survival, increasing the likelihood of transmission."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "What are the symptoms of dengue fever and severe dengue?", "answer": "Dengue fever Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and lasts for 2–7 days. Dengue fever usually occurs after an incubation period of 4–10 days after the bite of the infected mosquito. High Fever (40 °C/104 °F) is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms: headaches pain behind      eyes nausea, vomiting swollen glands joint, bone or muscle pains rash. Severe dengue Individuals infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. When developing into severe dengue, the critical phase takes place around 3–7 days after the first sign of illness. Temperature will decrease; this does not mean the person is necessarily recovering. On the other hand, special attention needs to be given to these warning signs as it could lead to severe dengue: severe abdominal pain persistent vomiting bleeding gums rapid breathing fatigue/ restlessness blood in vomit or stool being very thirsty pale and cold skin. People with these severe symptoms should get care right away.  Severe dengue can cause: plasma leaking that may lead to shock and/or fluid accumulation with/without      respiratory distress; severe bleeding; and severe organ      impairment. For people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often needed."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "What is the treatment for dengue?", "answer": "There is no specific medication for dengue fever. Patients should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids. Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and reduce joint pains. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding. Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection via Aedes mosquitoes after the first symptoms appear (during 4–5 days; maximum 12). As a precautionary approach, patients can adopt measures to reduce transmission by sleeping under a treated net especially during the period of illness with fever. Infection with one strain will provide life-time protection only against that particular strain. However, it is still possible to become infected by other strains and develop into severe dengue. When warning signs of severe dengue are present (listed above), it is imperative to consult a doctor and seek hospitalization to manage the disease. With proper medical care and early recognition, case-fatality rates are below 1%. However, the overall experience remains very discomforting and unpleasant."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "What should I do if I suspect I have dengue?", "answer": "If you suspect you have dengue you need to see a doctor immediately. To diagnose dengue fever, your doctor will: evaluate your signs and      symptoms test your blood for evidence of      a dengue virus review your medical and travel      history. Persons who had travelled to dengue endemic countries during the past two weeks should inform the doctor about it."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "Who spreads dengue and severe dengue?", "answer": "Dengue is spread through the bite of the female mosquito ( Aedes aegypti ). The mosquito becomes infected when it takes the blood of a person infected with the virus. After about one week, the mosquito can transmit the virus while biting a healthy person. The mosquito can fly up to 400 metres looking for water-filled containers to lay their eggs but usually remains close to human habitation. Aedes aegypti is a daytime feeder : The peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk. Hence, a person can get bitten at home or at work. Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. However, a person infected and suffering from dengue fever can infect other mosquitoes. Humans are known to carry the infection from one country to another or from one area to another during the stage when the virus circulates and reproduces in the blood system. Aedes aegypti has evolved into an intermittent biter and prefers to bite more than one person during the feeding period. This mechanism has made Aedes aegypti a very highly efficient epidemic vector mosquito. Aedes albopictus also transmits dengue."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "Where do the mosquitoes breed?", "answer": "The mosquitoes thrive in areas close to the human population (urban areas). The dengue mosquito lays its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house and surrounding areas of dwellings (this includes non-used bottles, containers, discarded waste, old tyres etc. which hold water). The eggs hatch when in contact with water. Eggs can withstand very dry conditions and survive for months. Female mosquitoes lay dozens of eggs up to 5 times during their lifetime. Adult mosquitoes usually rest indoors in dark areas (closets, under beds, behind curtains). Here it is protected from wind, rain and most predators, which increases its life expectancy and the probability that it will live long enough to pick up a virus from one person and pass it on to the next."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "What can be done to reduce the risk of acquiring dengue?", "answer": "The best preventive measure for areas infested with Aedes mosquito is to eliminate the mosquitoes’ egg laying sites – called source reduction. Lowering the number of eggs, larvae and pupae will reduce the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and the transmission of the disease. Examples of the following habitats are listed: Indoor ant traps flower vases and saucers water storage tank (domestic       drinking water, bathroom, etc.) plastic containers bottles. Outdoor discarded bottles and tins discarded tyres artificial containers tree holes, potholes,       construction sites drums for collecting rainwater shells, husks, pods from trees leaf axils of various plants boats, equipment. Items that collect rainwater or are used to store water should be covered or properly discarded. The remaining essential containers should be emptied, cleaned and scrubbed (to remove eggs) at least once a week. This will prevent adult mosquitoes from emerging from the egg/larva/pupa stage. Community participation is the key to dengue prevention. As every household aims to reduce vector density, the transmission rate will decrease or even stop."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "Personal and household protection", "answer": "Protecting yourself from mosquito bites is most effective by reducing exposed skin to mosquitoes to bite on. Long-sleeved clothing and mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) are the most viable options. Window and door screens and air conditioning reduce the risk of mosquitoes coming into contact with household members. Mosquito nets (and/or insecticide-treated nets) will also provide additional protection to people sleeping during the day or protect against other mosquitoes that can bite at night (such as malaria). Household insecticide aerosols, mosquito coils, or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce biting activity."}
{"topic": "/dengue-and-severe-dengue", "question": "Is there a dengue vaccine?", "answer": "Currently one vaccine is available for dengue prevention. TAK-003 is the only available dengue vaccine to be licensed. The vaccine schedule is a 2-dose series, three months apart, given to specific age groups and in specific circumstances according to WHO recommendations. WHO recommends using TAK-003 in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high dengue transmission intensity. WHO does not currently recommend the programmatic use of TAK-003 in children aged <6 years because of the lower efficacy of the vaccine in this age group. The TAK-003 vaccine should not be administered to: people who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant at least 1 month following      vaccination; people who are breastfeeding; people with congenital or acquired immune deficiency, including those receiving      immunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic      corticosteroids (for example 20 mg/day or 2 mg/kg body      weight/day of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to      vaccination; and people with symptomatic HIV infection or with asymptomatic HIV infection      associated with evidence of impaired immune function. Travellers : Persons living in non-endemic countries who have previously been infected with any of the 4 dengue virus serotypes following travel to dengue-endemic countries may benefit from TAK-003 vaccination to prevent a second (and hence potentially more severe) dengue infection when travelling again to an endemic country. Vaccination against dengue should be viewed as part of an integrated strategy to control the disease, including vector control, proper case management, community education and community engagement. Comprehensive vector control must remain a critical component of dengue control programmes."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "How much e-waste is generated each year and where does it go?", "answer": "The Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP) estimates that 62 million tonnes of e-waste were generated in 2022. This was equivalent to 7.8 kg of e-waste for every person in the world in 2022 (1) . Only 22.3% of e-waste was documented globally as being properly collected and recycled in 2022. The remaining e-waste was likely dumped, traded or recycled under inferior conditions. Even in areas with well-organized waste management systems, e-waste is often discarded alongside other solid waste and ends up in landfills. Such discarded e-waste can leach hazardous substances into aquifers and drinking water supplies and can pose significant risks to human health and the environment. The reliance on and use of a wide range of technologies is growing exponentially around the world. Additionally, rapid obsolescence is causing faster replacement cycles, and technological advances are creating new products containing valuable and dangerous components, such as electric cars and e-cigarettes. Without action, these factors are expected to lead to record amounts of e-waste. Annual global e-waste levels are expected to reach 82 million tonnes by 2030 (1) ."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "Which hazardous substances are released when e-waste is recycled using unsound activities and practices? How are children and informal workers exposed to them?", "answer": "More than 1000 different harmful substances have been identified that are either components of e-waste or produced through unsound recycling activities, including lead, cadmium, mercury, dioxins, nickel, brominated flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These substances can pollute the air, dust, water and soil. Workers, their families and communities are exposed to hazardous substances when reclaiming valuable metals from e-waste through open burning, heating, acid leaching (using cyanide salt, nitric acid or mercury), shredding, dismantling and open dumping. Burning e-waste materials makes recycling sites sources of toxic air pollution contaminated by mixes of harmful particles, including heavy metals and industrial chemicals and compounds. E-waste workers, their families and communities are exposed to these hazardous chemicals in several different ways. Primary routes of exposure include ingestion of contaminated food, water, soil and dust and inhalation of hazardous aerosol particles and gases. Children and babies face additional risks from direct contact with hazardous chemicals due to frequent hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth behaviours. Some chemicals found in e-waste or produced through unsound recycling activities can cross the placenta and expose the fetus. Young children have been reported working at recycling sites and are known to frequently work alongside their parents and families in recycling activities and businesses. Working as a waste picker, including e-waste, is considered hazardous labour and one of the worst forms of child labour by the International Labour Organization."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "How many children and women work in the informal e-waste processing sector?", "answer": "The ILO estimates that 16.5 million children were working in the industrial sector in 2020, of which waste processing is a subsector (2) . According to the latest global estimates of the total number of informal waste workers, anywhere between 2.9 and 12.9 million women are working in the informal waste sector. This potentially exposes them to hazardous substances from e-waste. As some chemicals found in e-waste streams can cross the placenta, if waste workers are pregnant, the fetus is also at risk of irreparable health effects."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "What are the child health impacts associated with informal recycling of e-waste?", "answer": "E-waste exposure has been linked to various adverse health outcomes. Prenatal and childhood exposures to e-waste toxicants may be associated with: impaired neurological and behavioural development, including changes to child temperament and behaviour and reduced cognitive and language scores; negative birth outcomes, including stillbirth, premature births, low birth weight and length; poorer lung function and increased respiratory effects, including cough, wheeze and asthma); negative immune system effects, including greater vulnerability to infection, reduced immunization response and higher rates of allergies and autoimmune diseases; and increased risk of chronic disease later in life, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Health outcomes that affect children’s health and development may last a lifetime. In studies of adults exposed to e-waste recycling activities, several health effects have been observed including: impaired thyroid function changes in cardiovascular system function DNA damage."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "Why are children particularly vulnerable to hazardous substances released through unsound e-waste recycling activities?", "answer": "Children are more vulnerable than adults to hazardous substances released through unsound e-waste recycling activities as they have immature immune, respiratory and central nervous systems, and are going through a rapid period of growth and development. Children absorb more pollutants relative to their size and immature systems may not be able to break down some hazardous substances and eliminate them. Children are closer to the ground where some air pollutants, such as mercury, may be at their highest concentration. As children practice more frequent hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth activity, this increases their risk of ingesting contaminants. Children have less agency than adults and do not choose where they live, how much time they spend indoors or at their parent’s workplaces, where they may be exposed to high levels of toxicants from unsound recycling activities."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "What actions can be taken to protect children’s health from unsound e-waste recycling?", "answer": "In response to the health and environmental threats from unsound e-waste recycling practices, United Nations (UN) agencies and independent experts have called for stronger regulations and legislation. This means effective and binding action by exporters, importers and governments that: ensure health and safety of e-waste workers, children, their families and communities with systems that train and protect workers, and monitor exposures and health outcomes; enforce sound environmental health practices for disposal, recapture and reuse of materials; shift towards a circular economy by manufacturing more-durable equipment, use safer and less-toxic materials, and encourage sustainable consumption to reduce e-waste; manage e-waste by prioritizing health and environmental protection throughout the life cycle, with reference to the Basel Convention, appropriate regional conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals; and eliminate child labour and incorporate adult e-waste workers into the formal economy with decent working conditions across the value chain of collection, processing, recycling and resale. There are also economic imperatives for improving global e-waste recycling systems. Better recycling presents opportunities for increased income and decreased demand for new materials. GESP estimates that benefits could exceed costs by more than US$ 38 billion if countries bring the e-waste collection and recycling rate to 60% by 2030 (1) ."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "What can the healthcare sector do to protect children from unsound e-waste recycling activities and hazardous substances?", "answer": "The healthcare sector has a critical role to play in maintaining and stimulating change that will protect children’s health from harmful e-waste recycling activities. At the clinical level, healthcare professionals can: stay up-to-date on health issues and diseases associated with e-waste recycling activities; where relevant, include e-waste recycling as an environmental etiology in differential diagnoses; diagnose and treat conditions associated with unsound e-waste recycling activities; provide prevention advice and interventions to reduce and prevent exposures; and educate patients and their families, communities, other healthcare professionals and officials on health risks of unsound e-waste recycling activities. The healthcare sector also provides essential leadership and advocacy to e-waste initiatives and contributions to multi-sectoral action. Opportunities for healthcare sector leadership and collaboration include: local, national and international capacity-building activities to diagnose, monitor and prevent toxic exposures within primary health care services for children and women; health-based assessments of e-waste policies and regulations, particularly regarding children’s health; awareness raising of e-waste recycling health risks and encouraging responsible recycling with policy-makers, communities, waste workers and their families; and pursuing better data and research on women and children working with e-waste, and evaluation studies of prevention-intervention measures."}
{"topic": "/children-and-digital-dumpsites-e-waste-and-health", "question": "What is WHO doing to reduce the health risks of e-waste recycling?", "answer": "The WHO Initiative on E-waste and Child Health was launched in 2013 and contributes to international e-waste programmes and pilot projects in countries in Latin America and Africa. The pilot projects aim to promote local advocacy, collaborate with affected communities, and build the capacity of primary health systems to address risks by monitoring e-waste exposure and measuring the success of interventions. These projects are designing frameworks for action that can be adapted and replicated in different countries and settings. The WHO Initiative aims to: increase access to evidence, knowledge and awareness of the health effects of unsound e-waste recycling; improve health sector capacity to manage and prevent risks, track progress and promote policies that protect child health; improve monitoring of e-waste exposures; and facilitate and evaluate interventions that protect public health. WHO publishes a training package for the health sector , including a specific module on e-waste and children’s health. Additionally, UNICEF and WHO have developed a free, self-paced and online introductory course on children’s environmental health. This online course features a section dedicated to e-waste. WHO is a member of the E-Waste Coalition, a group of 10 UN agencies and international organizations that aim to increase collaboration, build partnerships and more efficiently provide support to Member States to address the e-waste challenge."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "Can breastfeeding alone really be enough for my baby for six months?", "answer": "Breastfeeding alone can provide all the food and water your baby needs for the first six months of their lives. Babies do not need any food or drink except breast milk, not even water, until they are six months old. This is called exclusive breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of a baby’s life because it gives them the best chance of achieving optimal growth, development and health."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "How can I know that my baby is getting enough breast milk each day?", "answer": "If your baby is having at least 6 wet single-use nappies or at least 8 washable nappies each day (sunrise to sunrise), their stool is unformed and plentiful and they are growing according to the WHO Growth Standards , you can be confident they are getting enough breast milk."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "How can I increase the amount of breast milk my baby is having each day?", "answer": "If you think your baby needs to have more breast milk each day, you can offer breastfeeds more often during the day and overnight and ask a breastfeeding counsellor or health care worker to check your baby’s attachment. Most babies need to breastfeed 8–12 times in 24 hours in the first six months."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "Should I give my baby water on hot days", "answer": "No, you should not give water to a baby under six months of age, even on hot days. Babies under six months do not need water because breast milk has all the water a baby needs. Breast milk is more than 80% water. If you think your baby is thirsty, you can offer an extra breastfeed. Many mothers find that their babies want to breastfeed more often on hot days. Giving water to a baby under six months can cause diarrhoea and lead to malnutrition. Giving water may also cause the baby to drink less breastmilk or to stop breastfeeding early."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "Can I take medication if I am breastfeeding?", "answer": "Most medications can be taken while you are breastfeeding without affecting your baby. If you or your health care provider are worried that taking your medication might affect your breastfed baby, check with a specialized pharmaceutical advisory service, such as e-lactancia.org , infantrisk.com or lactmed ."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "How can I be sure my milk is nutritious enough for my baby?", "answer": "If you breastfeed your baby whenever they indicate that they are hungry during the day and at night and allow them to breastfeed until they finish suckling and let go of the breast, or fall asleep, your breast milk will provide all the nourishment your baby needs until they are 6 months of age. Eating a healthy diet is just as important for breastfeeding mothers as it is for everyone else. Breastfeeding mothers should follow the Five Keys for a Healthy Diet . Even when a mother’s diet is not very healthy, her breast milk still contains all the nourishment her baby needs for the first six months of life."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "When should I start offering my baby family foods as well as breastfeeding?", "answer": "WHO recommends that you start offering your baby family foods in addition to breast milk from six months (180 days) of age."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "What foods should I offer my baby?", "answer": "From six months, you can start offering your baby the same healthy foods the rest of your family eats. Babies need to eat animal-source foods (including meat, fish and eggs) and vegetables and fruits every day. Pulses (like lentils, chickpeas and beans), nuts and seeds should be eaten frequently, especially if meat or vegetables are limited. Food should always be stored correctly and prepared safely to prevent food-borne illnesses. Help your baby learn to feed themselves by choosing soft foods they can hold and put into their own mouths."}
{"topic": "/breastfeeding", "question": "How long should I keep breastfeeding my child?", "answer": "WHO recommends you keep breastfeeding your child up to two years and beyond and for as long as you both want to continue. Breastfeeding never stops protecting children from infectious disease."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "For whom is this tool useful?", "answer": "The tool is useful for policy makers, programme planners and managers, the donor community, advocates for FGM abandonment and anyone interested in learning more about the impact of FGM on health and economies."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "How do you hope that countries will use this tool?", "answer": "This tool can be considered an advocacy tool—demonstrating to countries the positive economic impacts of ending FGM. FGM accounts for on average 9% and up to 30% of the current health expenditures per capita in the 27 included countries."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "How were the costs calculated?", "answer": "The increased health risks associated with FGM were calculated using the best available scientific evidence. Health conditions which have a statistically significant increased risk were included in this analysis. Costs of treating  health complications were calculated using standard methods ( WHO OneHealth Tool) and (WHO guidance and tools on treatment of health complications of FGM ),\r\nand these costs were applied according to demographic data in each country to arrive at current costs and to project cost savings in  each of those countries."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "What information can this tool give?", "answer": "The tool allows the user to choose to visualize data by country on the costs associated with health complications of FGM over a woman’s lifetime. It shows how much money can be saved if FGM is prevented – both for now, and for future generations. Users can see the impact of investing in the prevention of FGM both for particular countries and also globally."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "What is the FGM cost calculator?", "answer": "It is an interactive online tool developed by WHO to visualize current health care related costs of FGM. The tool allows users to see cost savings that can be expected by abandoning the practice in current and future generations in about 30 countries which have the highest prevalence of FGM."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "What is WHO doing to address FGM?", "answer": "WHO plays a critical role in building the health sector response to FGM. The primary aim of this work is to support countries to prevent the practice of FGM while also ensuring that health care providers can provide the highest quality care possible for the millions of women and girls already affected. WHO: (1) develops evidence-based guidance and tools for the health sector to prevent FGM and manage its health complications; (2) supports countries to strengthen their health sector response to FGM; and (3) generates evidence on the epidemiology and costs of FGM, as well as evidence on effectiveness of interventions to prevent FGM and mitigate its consequences."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "What types of costs are included in the tool?", "answer": "FGM increases the risk of multiple health complications, which have significant costs. To ensure the economic model was data driven and to maintain clear parameters of the cost analysis, the tool shares estimates of health-related costs attributable to FGM and the reduction in these costs that could potentially be achieved with abandonment of FGM. There are many additional costs of FGM, not covered by this tool. Some of these are presently not quantifiable. Some of these have not been sufficiently researched which means there is a lack of evidence to include into an economic model."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "Which countries are included in the tool?", "answer": "27 countries with a high prevalence of FGM are included in the tool.  These countries have existing population-based data on the prevalence of FGM. There are also estimates available on specific types of FGM for these countries. Countries included are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Iraq, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Togo, United Republic of Tanzania, Yemen. While population-based data for Liberia, Indonesia and Uganda exist, these countries were not included as they lacked data on types of FGM."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "Why do costs not disappear when FGM is abandoned?", "answer": "Throughout the world, there are currently 200 million women and girls already affected by FGM. Some are still children and unfortunately many continue to suffer health consequences as a result of FGM. These health consequences, and their associated costs generally cannot be prevented. Countries must continue to ensure provision of the highest quality health care to women and girls affected by FGM. WHO has developed guidance and tools to help countries and health care providers to provide high quality health care."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "Why does this tool focus on economic cost only?", "answer": "The burden of health costs can be a powerful incentive for countries to take action to ensure that FGM is reduced and abandoned.  The financial burden for health systems is linked to sustainable development and human rights. When women thrive, families and communities are also more likely to thrive. Prevention of FGM helps girls and women to reach their full potential, for example, by participating fully in society through education and work. By preventing FGM, countries can reduce their expenditures for treatment and care, child protection and judicial services, which may enable them to invest more fully in development initiatives – which in turn can support the rights of girls, women and entire populations of a country."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "Why is it important to estimate the financial cost of female genital mutilation (FGM)?", "answer": "The health complications caused by FGM put a heavy financial burden on health systems.  Preventing new cases of FGM will reduce cost to countries, communities and individual women and their families."}
{"topic": "/fgm-cost-calculator", "question": "Why is zero tolerance of FGM so important?", "answer": "WHO promotes a zero tolerance stance to FGM. Any type of FGM can lead to severe health complications, both in the short and long-term. FGM is internationally recognized as a violation of the human rights of girls and women and must never be carried out."}
{"topic": "/zika-safe-blood-supply", "question": "Can Zika virus be transmitted through donated blood?", "answer": "Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito but can also be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, as well as directly through sexual contact. Zika virus has been detected in blood donors during Zika outbreaks and transmission by transfusion of blood and blood products has been described in a few cases in Brazil; therefore, Zika virus may present a risk to blood safety. In addition, the possibility exists of transmission through infected organ transplantation. Precautions should be taken to ensure the supply of blood is safe."}
{"topic": "/zika-safe-blood-supply", "question": "What precautions should be taken to ensure that the blood supply is safe in countries where Zika infection is occurring?", "answer": "Ideally the blood supply during a regional outbreak of Zika should be maintained by increasing blood collections in non-affected areas. In non-affected areas, consideration may be given to defer potential donors who have recently visited areas with ongoing transmission of Zika virus infection for 28 days after their departure from these areas. If a donor is diagnosed with Zika within weeks after blood donation, they should inform the blood collection centre. It is generally recommended that donors wait four months after confirmed infection before donating again."}
{"topic": "/zika-safe-blood-supply", "question": "What about blood donations in areas affected by Zika?", "answer": "Blood collection may need to continue in affected areas to meet \nneeds for blood and its components. This may be necessary when an \noutbreak is affecting a large swathe of a country or when it is not \npossible to get blood from regions where Zika is not circulating."}
{"topic": "/zika-safe-blood-supply", "question": "What measures may be considered for reducing the risk of Zika virus through blood transfusion in areas with active Zika virus transmission?", "answer": "Temporary exclusion of donors with a recent clinical history consistent with Zika virus disease, such as a combination of rash with fever, conjunctivitis (pinkeye), muscle aches, headache or malaise. Temporary exclusion of donors for whom laboratory test results show they may recently have been infected; donors may have prolonged presence of virus in the blood for up to four months after infection. Donors with clinical history consistent with Zika virus disease or a recent history of Zika virus infection should be deferred for a period not less than 28 days following the full resolution of symptoms. Similarly, sex partners of men with confirmed or suspected Zika virus infection in the last 3 months should be deferred for at least 28 days after their last sexual contact. People who have already donated must be encouraged to report to the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus infection within 14 days after blood donation. Blood components of appropriate shelf life (e.g. red blood cells) may be quarantined for a period of 7–14 days and released following confirmation from the donor that he or she has not experienced symptoms consistent with the acute phase of Zika virus infection. For platelets, which have a shorter shelf life, a 3-day quarantine period may be considered. Countries with many visitors to affected countries may need to assess the impact of deferral on blood supply availability and weigh the risks against the benefits of restricting donations."}
{"topic": "/zika-safe-blood-supply", "question": "How could blood donations be tested for the presence of Zika virus?", "answer": "Where possible, and where epidemiologically appropriate, blood donations may be tested for the presence of Zika virus by appropriate tests, such as nucleic acid amplification tests. Likely, pathogen reduction technology (PRT) may be implemented for plasma and platelets. In some cases, selective testing for the presence of the virus in blood donors returning from affected countries may be considered as an alternative to deferral."}
{"topic": "/zika-safe-blood-supply", "question": "Should countries that have Aedes mosquitoes but where Zika virus has not been found, have a preparedness plan for blood safety if an outbreak occurs?", "answer": "WHO recommends that countries where the mosquito that carries Zika is present, yet the virus itself has not been found, consider preparing a plan to ensure the availability of a safe and sufficient supply of blood should an outbreak occur."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "Why and how were amendments made to the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR)?", "answer": "In light of the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, in January 2022, the Executive Board of WHO, through decision EB150(3) , urged “Member States to take all appropriate measures to consider potential amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005)” to strengthen the global preparedness and response capacity to public health emergencies. In May 2022, the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly, through decision WHA75(9) , decided to establish the Member State-led Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) (WGIHR) to consider potential amendments to the IHR, and invited Member States to propose amendments to the IHR by 30 September 2022 (amendments proposed by States Parties to the IHR are available here ). The Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly further asked the Director-General to convene a Review Committee regarding amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) to provide technical recommendations on the proposed amendments. The Review Committee submitted its report to the Director-General in January 2023, who shared it with the WGIHR. The WGIHR commenced its work on 14 November 2022 and concluded it on 24 May 2024. The outcome of the WGIHR negotiations was submitted for consideration by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly (document A77/9). A package of amendments to the IHR was agreed by Member States through the work of a Drafting Group, from 29 May through 1 June 2024, established by Committee A of the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly. On 1 June 2024, the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, through a resolution, adopted the package of amendments to the IHR."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "Who decided on the amendments to the IHR?", "answer": "There are 196 States Parties to the IHR: all 194 WHO Member States plus Liechtenstein and the Holy See, and it is they who negotiated the amendments to the IHR."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "Were all States Parties required to agree on the IHR amendments for them to be adopted? Is abstention considered agreement?", "answer": "The package of amendments was adopted by consensus, i.e. without a vote, by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly on 1 June 2024. The amendments will come into force for all States Parties except for those States Parties that may notify the Director-General of a rejection or reservation within a set deadline which will be communicated by WHO to all States Parties."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "Will the amended IHR give WHO the ability to forcefully impose health measures, lockdowns or restrictions on the populations of any country?", "answer": "No. WHO will have no ability to impose any health measure, including lockdowns or other restrictions, on the populations of any country."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "When will the amendments to the IHR come into force?", "answer": "In accordance with Article 59 of the IHR (as amended in 2022), the amendments adopted by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly through resolution WHA77.17 (2024) will come into force 12 months following the notification by the Director-General to all States Parties, which occurred on 19 September 2024. The amendments will, therefore, come into force on 19 September 2025. With respect to the four States Parties that rejected the 2022 amendments, the amendments adopted by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly will come into force 24 months after after the 19 September 2024 notification by the Director-General to those States Parties, on 19 September 2026."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "What criteria are used by the WHO Director-General when determining a public health emergency of international concern?", "answer": "Article 1 of the IHR defines a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States Parties through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.” In accordance with Article 12(4) of the IHR, in determining whether an event constitutes a PHEIC, the Director-General shall, among other issues, consider the following: information provided by the State Party; the Emergency Committee’s advice; scientific principles, available scientific      evidence and other relevant information; and an assessment of the risks to human health, international spread of disease and interference with international traffic."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "What are the implications for States Parties of the WHO Director-General determining a public health emergency of international concern?", "answer": "The determination of an event as PHEIC serves as a global alert and, most importantly, it implies the issuance of Temporary Recommendations to States Parties – which, by definition, are not legally binding – to guide them in preparing for and responding to the PHEIC. Under the IHR, Temporary Recommendations automatically expire three months after their issuance. Emergency Committees are, therefore, reconvened at least every three months to advise the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, as well as on temporary recommendations to States Parties that the Director-General may continue to issue. A statement of the Emergency Committee meeting is published on the WHO website after each Committee meeting."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "The amendments have introduced a “pandemic emergency”, which constitutes the highest level of global alert that the Director-General May issue. What are the criteria for a pandemic emergency being determined?", "answer": "In accordance with the definition adopted by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, a “pandemic emergency” means a public health emergency of international concern that is caused by a communicable disease and: has, or is at high risk of having, wide geographical spread to and within multiple States; and is exceeding, or is at high risk of exceeding, the capacity of health systems to respond in those States; and is causing, or is at high risk of causing, substantial social and/or economic disruption, including disruption to international traffic and trade; and requires rapid, equitable and enhanced coordinated international action, with whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches.”"}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "What are the implications for States Parties of the WHO Director-General determining a pandemic emergency?", "answer": "The determination of an event as a pandemic emergency serves as the highest level of global alert and, most importantly, it implies the issuance of Temporary Recommendations to States Parties – which, by definition, are not legally binding – to guide them in preparing for and responding to the PHEIC."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "Was Article 55 of the IHR applied to the WGIHR process?", "answer": "Yes. Provisions of Article 55 of the IHR, which set out who can propose amendments to the IHR, and when and how such proposals must be communicated to States Parties, have been met by the WHO Secretariat. Article 55(1) of the IHR enables any State Party or the WHO Director-General to propose amendments to the IHR for consideration by the World Health Assembly. This has been applied to the WGIHR process. Article 55(2) of the IHR further provides that the WHO Director-General shall communicate any proposed amendment to all States Parties at least four months before the World Health Assembly for consideration. This applies to any proposed IHR amendment submitted by a State Party or the WHO Director-General pursuant to Article 55(1). In fulfilling the Article 55(2) requirement, the WHO Secretariat circulated all proposals for amendments to the IHR on 16 November 2022, some 17 months before the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, which begins on 27 May 2024, when they are proposed for consideration. The World Health Assembly established the WGIHR, which operates as a subdivision of the Assembly and includes all 196 States Parties. As such, the WHO Secretariat has further exceeded the technical requirements of Article 55(2) by communicating not only the original 308 amendments, but also by communicating all proposed changes to these amendments developed by the WGIHR drafting group, to all 196 States Parties, after each WGIHR meeting. These communications to all States Parties occurred at the conclusion of each WGHIR meeting. In sum, both the letter and the spirit of Article 55(2) have been met. The letter of the provision was fulfilled, again, by the communication of 16 November 2022. This was well in advance of the four-month requirement. This notice maximized the time available for all States Parties for domestic and international consideration and coordination. The spirit of the provision, which is to ensure that all States Parties have adequate time to consider and coordinate domestically and internationally on the proposed amendments in the run up to the Assembly, has been met."}
{"topic": "/international-health-regulations-amendments", "question": "How does the WGIHR’s work relate to that of the group leading negotiations on a pandemic agreement?", "answer": "During a Special Session of the Health Assembly in December 2021, governments agreed to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument under WHO’s Constitution to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response . These negotiations are ongoing, led by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB). A new pandemic agreement could contain a provision on its relationship to other international instruments, including clarifying its complementarity with the IHR. Article 57 of the IHR includes provisions regarding the relationships with other international agreements, including the possibility for State Parties to conclude special treaties or arrangements to facilitate the implementation of the IHR. In establishing the INB, the World Health Assembly noted the “need for coherence and complementarity between the process of developing the new instrument and the ongoing work with regard to implementation and strengthening of the IHR (2005).” At the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly, on 1 June 2024,\r\nWHO’s Member States decided to extend the INB’s mandate, to allow the INB to\r\nfinish its work as soon as possible, and submit its outcome for consideration\r\nby the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly in 2025, or earlier by a special\r\nsession of the World Health Assembly if possible in 2024."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "What is rehabilitation?", "answer": "Rehabilitation is a health service for people who experience a decline in their functioning due to an illness, injury, surgery, disability or age. Its primary goal is to help regain, maintain or improve functioning so the person can lead an independent and fulfilling live."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "Who might benefit from rehabilitation?", "answer": "Children, adolescents, adults or older people may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives. This includes people with acute or chronic health conditions (such as stroke, heart disease, respiratory diseases, cancer), injuries (such as fractures, burns, brain injuries) or congenital disorders (such as autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy)."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "Is rehabilitation about drug and alcohol addiction?", "answer": "Rehabilitation services may benefit people with many health conditions. Drug and alcohol rehabilitation is only one type of rehabilitation that is aimed at helping people overcome addiction to substances. Learn more: WHO Alcohol, Drugs and Addictive Behaviours unit ."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "How many people could benefit from rehabilitation?", "answer": "Globally, 1 in 3 people are currently living with a health condition that may benefit from rehabilitation. This need is growing as the population ages with more chronic diseases. Over 50% of people in some low- and middle-income countries lack access to needed rehabilitation services. Emergencies like conflicts and disasters increase demand while disrupting services, worsening the unmet need for rehabilitation worldwide."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "What are the most frequent health conditions that could benefit from rehabilitation?", "answer": "There are many different conditions that can benefit from rehabilitation such us: musculoskeletal conditions neurological conditions cardiopulmonary conditions vision impairment and hearing loss neurodevelopmental disorders mental health conditions cancers."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "What are examples of rehabilitation?", "answer": "Some examples of rehabilitation include: speech and language training to improve a person’s communication after a brain injury; physical exercise training to improve muscle strength, voluntary movements and balance in people with stroke or Parkinson disease; modifying an older person’s home environment to improve their safety and independence at home and to reduce their risk of falls; educating a person with heart disease on how to exercise safely; preparing a person with an amputation to be able to use a prosthetic device; making, fitting and refitting the prosthesis; positioning and splinting techniques to assist with skin healing, techniques and exercises to reduce swelling, and to regain movement after burn injury; prescribing medicine to reduce spasticity for a child with cerebral palsy; psychological therapies for a person with emotional distress following a spinal cord injury; social skills training for persons with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders or disorders of intellectual disability; training a person with vision loss in the use of a white cane; and working with a patient in intensive care to improve their breathing, prevent complications and speed their recovery after critical illness."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "What would my rehabilitation look like?", "answer": "Your rehabilitation programme will depend on your specific situation. As a general rule, a rehabilitation professional will assess your level of functioning and potential underlaying causes for your problems in functioning. Based on this assessment, the rehabilitation professional will define the goals of your rehabilitation programme together with you. Next, the type of intervention, intensity and duration that best adapt to your situation will be designed. You may need exercises or training, assistive products, modifications to your environment, education and advice, or use of certain medicines. Throughout the process the rehabilitation professional would evaluate whether your goals are being achieved."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "Where does rehabilitation take place?", "answer": "There is no one single setting for a rehabilitation service. However, rehabilitation professionals should be in a range of available health and non-health settings. This includes in hospitals, in specialist rehabilitation centres, in health clinics and posts, in schools and at people’s homes."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "Who can provide rehabilitation?", "answer": "Depending on the rehabilitation need, one or more health professionals may collaborate to provide comprehensive care. The most common rehabilitation professionals include physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, audiologists, orthotists and prosthetists, clinical psychologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, and rehabilitation nurses. However, many more exist, and the professionals can vary between countries."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "Are there any risks to receiving rehabilitation?", "answer": "As for any health service, safety considerations are needed. The rehabilitation professional will make sure that the type and intensity of the selected interventions do no harm but are save."}
{"topic": "/rehabilitation", "question": "How long will I need rehabilitation and what will be the results?", "answer": "Usually, a rehabilitation programme comprises a series of sessions, but the number of sessions will depend on your needs. In the ideal situation, you will regain full functioning but often, depending on the severity of your health condition, the level of functioning will be optimized so that you will be able to return to your meaningful activities with e.g. the use of assistive products in a modified environment."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What is lead?", "answer": "Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust. It has many uses, including in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles and energy storage, in pigments and paints, solder, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys and in some cosmetics and traditional medicines. Lead additives have been phased out of petrol globally for motor vehicles (1) ; however, lead continues to be used in some aviation fuels. The processing, use and disposal of lead can result in widespread environmental contamination and lead to human exposure. As lead is an element, it is highly persistent in the environment."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What are the sources of human exposure to lead?", "answer": "Lead has had many uses throughout history and consequently there are many potential sources of exposure. Important sources today include environmental contamination from the recycling of lead-acid batteries and from poorly controlled lead mining and smelting operations; the use of lead-containing traditional, complementary and integrative medicines; lead ceramic glazes used on food containers; lead pipes and other lead-containing components in water distribution systems; and lead paint. Informal, unsound recycling electrical and electronic waste is a growing source of environmental lead contamination, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (2) . Leaded gasoline was an important source of exposure , but all countries have now banned its use . The continued use of tetraethyl lead in some aviation fuels exposes communities around airfields to lead (3). Environmental contamination can lead to ingestion and inhalation of lead and its compounds. Most cases of oral lead poisoning result from small amounts of lead-containing material, such as contaminated dust or soil or flakes of lead paint. Inhalation of lead as fumes or particles is a major occupational route of exposure."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What is lead poisoning?", "answer": "A diagnosis of lead poisoning is based on medical history, clinical examination and the results of investigations including blood lead concentration, biomarkers of effect such as full blood count and, if relevant, medical imaging. Exposure to lead can occur from inhalation of lead fumes and particles or from ingestion of lead-contaminated dust, water and food. Children are at high risk due to hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth behaviours. Exposure can occur over a short period (acute poisoning) or over a prolonged period (chronic poisoning). There is no level of exposure to lead that is known to be without harmful effects to health. As a consequence, some health authorities define excessive exposure as having a blood lead concentration above the reference value for the population as a whole. This reference value is usually the blood lead concentration that characterizes the top 2.5% or 5% of the population, i.e. the 97.5th or 95th percentile, respectively; however, this can change. For example, in the USA, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention lowered its blood lead reference value to 3.5 µg/dL for children aged 1–5 years based on the 97.5 th percentile in October 2021 (4) . In contrast, France uses a reference value of 5 µg/dL for children under 7 years based on the 98th percentile (5). WHO recommends that for an individual with a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 µg/dL, the source of lead exposure should be identified, and appropriate action taken to reduce and terminate exposure (6) ."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What are the health effects of lead poisoning?", "answer": "Lead has no biological function in the body and affects almost all organ systems. Studies to date have been unable to identify any level of exposure that has no harmful effects in children or adults (6) . Lead exposure can cause chronic and debilitating health effects in all age groups. It is particularly harmful to young children as the developing nervous system is vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead, even at low-levels of exposure. Lead exposure in early childhood can result in reduced cognitive abilities, lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, antisocial behaviours and reduced educational attainment. The initial signs of lead exposure may include sporadic vomiting, loss of appetite, behavioural changes with aggression, irritability and agitation, headache, clamminess and intermittent lethargy. Lead exposure can also cause anaemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs (6) . Severe lead poisoning can cause coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with permanent neurological injury, such as deafness and intellectual disability. Lead can cross the placenta and has been linked to adverse birth outcomes including stillbirth, reduced birth weight, premature birth and miscarriage (6,7) . The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that more than 1.5 million deaths globally were attributed to lead exposure in 2021, primarily due to cardiovascular effects (8) ."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What are the costs associated with lead poisoning?", "answer": "There are both direct and indirect economic costs resulting from lead exposure. These include health care costs in treating lead poisoning, social costs such as the need for special education to combat lead-induced intellectual impairment, and productivity loss due to reduced IQ. The estimated economic costs attributable to the neurodevelopmental impacts of childhood lead exposure amounted to 1.2% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011. Expressed in terms of loss to regional GDP, the estimated cost in Africa was 4%, in Latin America and the Caribbean 2% and in Asia 1.9% (9)."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "How important are used lead-acid batteries as a source of lead exposure?", "answer": "Lead-acid batteries are used in motorized vehicles, for storage of energy generated by solar panels and wind turbines and for back-up power supplies. The growth in the use of renewable energy sources and the concomitant need for storage batteries, as well as the increasing demand for motor vehicles as countries undergo economic development, mean that the demand for lead-acid batteries is increasing. The majority of the total global consumption of lead is for the production of these batteries, and over half of this demand is met through recycling . On average, lead-acid batteries contain 10 kilograms of lead (10) . Lead, as fumes, particles and dust, can be released at all stages of the battery recycling process, from draining and dismantling the batteries to smelting and refining the lead. Environmental contamination from recycling can be extensive and can cause significant exposure to workers and to surrounding communities. People engaged in recycling who do not wash and change their clothes before leaving work can bring lead contamination home with them and expose household members, including children. Preventing lead release requires the use of adequate engineering controls, trained staff, the provision of protective equipment and the implementation of occupational and environmental standards. In many parts of the world where lead is recycled, these measures are not available or enforced. Non-regulated, informal lead-acid battery recycling is carried out in homes, backyards and surrounding areas, and is performed with few, if any, pollution controls. It has the potential to expose a large number of people across communities or neighbourhoods. Informal, or so-called backyard, recycling is widely practised in many LMICs and has resulted in cases of mass lead poisoning and is associated with many serious health outcomes including poor cognitive development in children, cardiovascular disease and even death (9,10) ."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What is lead paint?", "answer": "The term ‘paint’ can include varnishes, lacquers, stains, enamels, glazes, primers and other coatings. Paint is typically a formulated mixture of resins, pigments, fillers, solvents and other additives. Lead paint has one or more lead compounds added to give it specific properties such as colour, corrosion resistance or rapid drying. Lead compounds are primarily added to some solvent-based paints, such as enamel (gloss) paints. The lead content of paint can range from less than 90 ppm (90 mg/kg) to over 100 000 ppm (100 000 mg/kg). In paints with no added lead, there may be a small amount present as a contaminant of the raw materials used in manufacturing processes. When a manufacturer takes care to source uncontaminated raw materials, the lead content of paint is usually well below 90 ppm."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "How feasible is it to eliminate lead in paint, and how important are regulations to restrict the use of lead in paint?", "answer": "To achieve the global goal of phasing out lead paint, every country needs to implement legally-binding laws restricting the manufacture, sale, distribution and import of lead paint. Such measures can include statutes, regulations, and/or mandatory technical standards establishing a binding, enforceable limit on lead in paint, with penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, non-lead-based ingredients are available that can be used to formulate paint. Many manufacturers, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, have already successfully reformulated their products to avoid the use of lead-based ingredients, seeing it as part of their corporate social responsibility to protect workers, consumers and the environment. Lead paint data collected around the world show that in every country where studies have been conducted, there are paint companies producing paint containing less than 90 ppm of lead. This demonstrates that eliminating lead in all paints is within the capability of local producers (11). In those countries where no lead paint regulations, paint intended for household use containing hazardous levels of lead is typically widely available."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "Why is lead paint an important source of human exposure?", "answer": "Lead paint is still legal in 52% of countries and it is one of the most widespread sources of domestic exposure to lead for children (12) . As lead painted objects start to decay, the paint often fragments into flakes and dust that contaminate the home environment. This aging process can occur quickly in some climates. Paint flakes and dust are readily swallowed by young children, who typically play on the ground and have frequent hand-to-mouth activity. Some children compulsively pick flakes of paint off surfaces and eat them. The removal of lead paint, for example during home renovation or maintenance of painted structures, such as bridges, can result in the release of lead-contaminated dust if it is done improperly. Lead paint can remain a source of exposure for many years after its use is prohibited. Even in countries that banned lead paint decades ago, there are still many homes where lead painted surfaces can be found. The sooner that lead paint is banned in a country, the sooner this toxic legacy can be eliminated."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What are the economic costs of removing lead paint?", "answer": "Once lead paint has been applied in the home, it becomes a potential source of lead exposure, particularly as the paint starts to age and decay. In France, while the number of children with blood lead concentrations above 10 µg/dL is now small, 74% of cases are associated with poor quality housing where there is lead paint (13). Older housing with lead paint has also been identified in the USA as a risk factor for elevated blood lead concentrations in children (14). Removing lead paint carries a cost, particularly as measures must be taken to prevent environmental contamination with lead during removal and disposal. In France, based on 2008 values, it was estimated that the cost of remediating all homes with lead paint would range from €133.1 million to €342.5 million (US$ 193.8–498.7 million at 2008 exchange rates) (13) . In the USA, the costs of remediating lead-painted homes inhabited by young children were estimated to range from US$ 1.2 billion to US$ 11 billion in 2009 (14). Cost-benefit analyses have indicated that investment in lead paint abatement yields large returns. In France, the estimated net benefit was €3.8 billion (US$ 5.5 billion at 2008 exchange rates) (13) . These benefits were calculated on the basis of avoided health costs for the management of lead exposure and avoided social costs, for example in relation to reduced IQ, the need for special education and lost lifetime earnings. In the USA, it has been estimated that each dollar invested in lead paint hazard control yields a return of US$ 17–221 (14). The most cost-effective solution is to prevent the use of lead paint altogether. Eliminating the use of lead in paints does not need to be expensive and a number of manufacturers have already successfully reformulated products to avoid the intentional addition of lead (14)."}

{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What can Member States do to eliminate lead exposure?", "answer": "There are safer alternatives to lead compounds for use as pigments and driers in paint. However, there is still a general lack of awareness of lead and an absence of mandatory standards for lead in paints in many countries. In countries where lead paint is still available, governments should introduce legally binding controls to either ban or restrict the use of lead paint. Examples of control measures include prohibiting the use of any lead compounds in paint or setting a maximum permissible limit for the lead content of paint at the lowest feasible level. Additional information on establishing legally binding control measures, including a Model law and guidance for regulating lead paint can be found on the UNEP website. Other measures include requiring the use of paint with no added lead in public buildings such as schools and hospitals and informing the public about the hazards of lead to encourage the purchase of paint without added lead. Market pressure can encourage manufacturers to take voluntary action to phase-out lead compounds in paint. The Lead Paint Alliance is working towards the global elimination of lead paint through the adoption in all countries of legally binding laws, regulations, standards and procedures to control the production, import, sale and use of lead paints. This target gives special attention to the elimination of lead decorative paints and lead paints for other applications most likely to contribute to childhood lead exposure; however, the goal is to control lead in all paints. As of 31 March 2023, 93 countries had informed the Lead Paint Alliance secretariat that such control measures were in place. For further information on the status of legally binding controls, see the WHO Global Health Observatory database . The phasing out of lead paint is one of the priority actions for governments included in the WHO Road map to enhance health sector engagement in the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management towards the 2020 goal and beyond . This road map was approved by the Seventieth World Health Assembly in decision WHA70(23)."}

{"topic": "/chemical-safety-lead-poisoning", "question": "What can I do to prevent lead exposure?", "answer": "As an individual, one of the ways to protect yourself and your family from lead exposure is by being an informed and careful consumer. By being informed and aware of potential sources of lead exposure and the symptoms of lead exposure, you can avoid buying or using products that may contain lead. For example, check the label when buying paint to see if lead is an ingredient. If you are not sure ask the vendor or the manufacturer about possible lead content. If you know that lead paint is not legally controlled in your country, lobby your politicians to take action. If you are planning to redecorate a building or to renovate painted furniture and you think the original paint may contain lead, seek expert advice about safe methods for testing the paint before removing it, and ensure appropriate removal methods are used. When buying cosmetics and traditional, complementary and integrative medicines, only buy from a regulated manufacturer, as high levels of lead have been reported in some of these products. When you buy a new car battery, take the old one back to the distributor or to a licensed recycling facility rather than dumping or storing the battery or recycling it at an informal or unlicensed facility. Only dispose of your electrical and electronic equipment when they break, not simply when they go out of fashion. Dispose of end-of-life electrical and electronic items in designated bins or via take-back systems (15) ."}

How can work-related burden of disease be prevented?", "answer": "Governments, in consultation with workers and employers, can act to prevent work-related burden of disease. 4 Governments need to ensure universal coverage with occupational health services 5 and people-centred primary health care to reach disadvantaged workers, such as migrants and workers in the informal economy. 6 Additionally, social protection floors can protect disadvantaged workers. Earlier in September 2021, WHO with partner agencies put forward 20 actions that decision-makers and local actors can take to protect and promote health in the workplace, as part of a larger compendium of 500 actions to create healthier populations through healthy environments. 7 Employers can ensure provision of occupational and workers’ health and safety risk assessments and that workers have access to occupational health services. A collection of International Labour Standards on Occupational safety and health can be found in the NORMLEX information system. 8 Through regular occupational and workers’ health and safety assessments, workers’ exposure to occupational risk factors can be monitored and relevant health screening can be used to provide early detection of occupational disease (e.g. testing for exposure to occupational risk factors or screening for work-related or occupational diseases). Workers or their representatives and employers can ensure healthy and decent working conditions through bilateral and collective bargaining agreements. For each occupational risk factor, there are also specific measures that can be taken to prevent their work-related burden of disease. For many of the physical occupational risk factors, the Hierarchy of Controls 9 should be followed: ideally, risk factors should be eliminated or less hazardous substitutions used. If this is not possible, engineering controls can be introduced to isolate workers from the hazards, or administrative controls to change the way people work. Finally, if exposure cannot be reduced by other methods, workers can be protected with Personal Protective Equipment. Intersectoral action is required, at least between the health and labour sectors."}

It always applies the same definitions and framework; uses a similar method for combining exposure and risk information; and uses the same method for expressing results (often deaths and DALYs). The CRA links burden by disease and by risk factor. Our report for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates is WHO's most comprehensive CRA for occupational risk factors. It is the first joint CRA of WHO with ILO. This joint CRA comprises WHO/ILO Joint Estimates covering 19 risk factors and 31 health outcomes.

{"topic": "/total-who-ilo-joint-estimates-of-the-work-related-burden-of-disease-and-injury--2000-2016", "question": "12. How have the estimates been calculated?", "answer": "To estimate the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to an occupational risk factor and health outcome pair, it is necessary to know the population attributable fraction (PAF). A PAF quantifies the proportion of deaths or DALYs lost from a particular health outcome that is attributable to a specific risk factor, e.g. the proportion of deaths from stroke that can be attributed to exposure to long working hours. Additionally, the total number of deaths and DALYs that are estimated to occur each year for the health outcome are needed, e.g. the total number of deaths and DALYs from strokes in 2016. This is referred to the “total disease envelope”. 11 WHO produces these envelopes from mortality records collected by governments in countries. 12 For 39 of the pairs of occupational risk factors and health outcomes included in this report the methodology for estimating burden of disease is established. For these, we were able to calculate PAFs from established burden of disease estimates for each risk factor and health outcome. 13 These were applied to the total disease envelope for each year and for each disease. This resulted in estimates of the numbers of deaths and DALYs for each health outcome attributable to its respective occupational risk factor. For the estimates related to exposure to long working hours (≥ 55 hours per week) and cardiovascular diseases, 14 PAFs needed to be calculated. To do this, we required two key data sources: i) the prevalence of exposure to long working hours and ii) the risk ratio for the two cardiovascular outcomes among those exposed to long working hours compared to those not exposed to long working hours. Prevalence of exposure was modelled using data on the number of hours worked from over 2300 worldwide surveys. Risk ratios for the effect of exposure to long working hours on ischaemic heart disease and stroke were sourced from systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted by WHO and ILO, supported by a large number of individual experts. 15, 16 Once the PAFs were calculated, they were applied to WHO’s total disease envelopes for stroke and ischaemic heart disease."}

{"topic": "/suicide", "question": "What causes people to be suicidal?", "answer": "Suicidal behaviours are not easy to explain. They are never the result of a single factor or event. The factors that lead individuals to take their own life are multiple and complex. Health, mental health, stressful life events, and social and cultural factors need to be considered when trying to understand suicidal behaviour."}

{"topic": "/q-a-with-dr-ann-moen-how-influenza-preparedness-helps-fight-other-infectious-diseases", "question": "What lessons does influenza preparedness offer for tackling respiratory pathogens and other diseases?", "answer": "When you prepare for and respond to influenza (or flu) outbreaks, you are simultaneously learning and practicing responses to other respiratory events or emerging diseases. This is because influenza shares similar attributes to other respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19. Like influenza, many other respiratory viruses primarily affect the respiratory system, and symptoms are often indistinguishable. Moreover, respiratory pathogens often spread in similar ways. Preparing for a flu pandemic builds essential infrastructure and skills that can be applied to other diseases. For example, capacity building designed for influenza surveillance and outbreak response can be repurposed swiftly for other epidemic or pandemic prone diseases such as MERS, other coronaviruses or novel respiratory threats. You can practice your communications for responding to outbreaks and better understand the behavioural aspects of vaccine hesitancy. Influenza can also help you learn how to implement a vaccine programme and introduce new therapeutics. Influenza preparedness emphasizes the importance of international cooperation. Timely sharing data, resources, and expertise globally enhances the ability to respond to pandemics effectively."}
{"topic": "/q-a-with-dr-ann-moen-how-influenza-preparedness-helps-fight-other-infectious-diseases", "question": "Can you give an example where an influenza-monitoring programme has been used for other diseases?", "answer": "In Africa, in 2006, there were about five countries that had a surveillance programme to monitor influenza and process flu specimens. After many efforts to build capacities, there are now about 25 countries that routinely conduct flu surveillance. These influenza surveillance systems have been the primary capacity in countries, as demonstrated in emergencies: when the 2009 pandemic came, many of them were ready to diagnose the first cases through their newly established flu surveillance programmes and they were also at the forefront for testing SARS-CoV-2. Many countries are now integrating surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) into their influenza surveillance programmes. We also embarked on a global rapid response-training programme where we trained more than 100 countries, including many in Africa. Many of these countries were using the flu outbreak response teams to respond to respiratory and non-respiratory outbreaks such as measles, Rift Valley fever, Ebola, as well as during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."}
{"topic": "/q-a-with-dr-ann-moen-how-influenza-preparedness-helps-fight-other-infectious-diseases", "question": "Is there a long-term plan to help the world prepare for influenza?", "answer": "The WHO Global Influenza Programme (GIP) has been working on protecting the world from influenza for over 70 years through a global framework (the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)) and by providing surveillance, preparedness and response efforts. The WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework seeks to improve and strengthen the sharing of influenza viruses with human pandemic potential and to increase the access of developing countries to vaccines and other pandemic related supplies. The WHO Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) initiative also supports disease pandemic preparedness through an innovative approach. The Global Influenza Strategy 2019–2030, which draws on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and efforts to strengthen health systems to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), was adopted in the World Health Assembly in 2020. The Strategy calls for WHO Member States to develop seasonal influenza prevention and control measures. These efforts, in turn, will build greater preparedness for the next pandemic. The Strategy focuses on three priorities: strengthening pandemic preparedness expanding seasonal influenza prevention and control and research and innovation. Research and innovation covers improved modelling and forecasting of influenza outbreaks, along with the development of new vaccines."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "What is a refractive error?", "answer": "A refractive error is a very common eye condition. Due to an abnormal shape or length of the eye, light does not focus on the retina, which results in blurred vision. There are several types of refractive error: myopia (short-sightedness      or near-sightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly; hyperopia (long-sightedness      or farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly; astigmatism: distorted      vision resulting from irregular curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye      resulting in difficulty in seeing distant and close objects clearly; and presbyopia: difficulty in seeing objects at near distance that is associated with      increasing age (i.e. after 40 years of age) and occurs almost universally."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "Why is refractive error important?", "answer": "Uncorrected refractive error is the leading cause of vision impairment in both children and adult populations. If left uncorrected, refractive error significantly impacts on well-being, can contribute to poor academic performance in children, reduced workforce participation and productivity loss in working adults, and social isolation in older adults."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "How big is the problem of uncorrected refractive error?", "answer": "Globally, it is estimated that only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error have received access to spectacles. In addition, more than 800 million people have a near vision impairment (i.e. presbyopia) that could be addressed with a pair of reading spectacles. To confound this problem, the number of people in need of refractive error care is expected to increase substantially in the coming decade. Presbyopia, projected to reach 2.1 billion cases by 2030, is part of the ageing process. Meanwhile, the projected increase in myopia to 3.36 billion cases by 2030 will be driven largely by modifiable lifestyle related risk factors."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "How can refractive error be addressed?", "answer": "Reduced vision from refractive errors can be fully corrected with appropriate spectacles, contact lenses or treated by laser surgery. Spectacles are undoubtedly the most common intervention used worldwide to address refractive error. They are a non-invasive assistive product and are part of the WHO Priority Assistive Product List and WHO lists of Priority Medical Devices."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "Can refractive error be prevented?", "answer": "While presbyopia, hyperopia and astigmatism are not preventable, there are strategies that may help delay the onset and slow the progression of myopia in children. These include spending at least 90 minutes outdoors during daylight hours, taking regular breaks during near-work activities and consistently using prescribed spectacles or other optical interventions. Implementing these measures may reduce the risk of developing high myopia and its associated complications later in life."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "What are the barriers to deliver refractive error services?", "answer": "Despite the availability of simple, sight-correcting interventions such as a pair of spectacles, there are several challenges to increasing refractive error coverage. First, the burden of uncorrected refractive error is often greater in underserved communities or groups, such as those in rural areas, low-income populations, women, indigenous populations, and ethnic minorities. Second, in most low- and middle-income settings, refractive error services are not prioritized for government investments and are poorly integrated into health systems. Refractive error services are available primarily in the private sector, which can create issues of availability, affordability and quality. Other key challenges include low awareness and acceptance of spectacles among the public, insufficient availability of competent human resources to provide refractive services and dispense spectacles, limited government oversight and clinical regulation, and scarce services points that are predominantly located in urban areas."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "Do refractive errors cost countries money?", "answer": "Uncorrected refractive error poses a substantial economic burden on society: annual global productivity losses associated with vision impairment from uncorrected myopia in adults and presbyopia alone are estimated to be US$ 244 billion and US$ 25.4 billion, respectively. In contrast, the estimated financial resource gap to address unmet refractive error correction needs with spectacles is US$ 16 billion, a fraction of the economic losses incurred. Addressing uncorrected refractive errors could potentially yield a net positive economic impact of over US$ 250 billion annually. There is a strong health economic rationale for increasing coverage of eye care services and spectacles. For example, the correction of myopia with spectacles can return US$ 10.50 for every US$ 1.00 spent, while school eye health programmes can have a reported benefit cost ratio as high as 26.4 in some settings. For presbyopia, the near vision correction can increase average median income of people in low-income communities by over 30%."}
{"topic": "/blindness-and-vision-impairment-refractive-errors", "question": "What is WHO’s response to refractive error?", "answer": "WHO has taken significant steps to address the global challenge of refractive error, recognizing its widespread impact and the availability of cost-effective interventions. In 2021, at the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly, WHO Member States endorsed the first-ever global target for refractive error in: a 40-percentage-point increase in effective coverage of refractive error by 2030. This ambitious goal acknowledges the large unmet need for care and the potential for substantial improvement through accessible interventions like spectacles. To support Member States in the achievement of the World Health Assembly endorsed 2030 target, WHO launched the SPECS 2030 initiative in May 2024, a comprehensive approach to tackle refractive error globally.  This initiative calls for coordinated global action amongst all stakeholders across 5 strategic pillars (Services, Personnel, Education, Cost and Surveillance). By focusing on these key areas, the initiative aims to address the main challenges in refractive error care, including improving access to services, developing a skilled workforce, enhancing public awareness, reducing costs, and strengthening data collection and monitoring systems. Through the SPECS 2030 initiative, WHO is working to catalyse global efforts, promote best practices, and support Member States in achieving the 2030 target, ultimately aiming to reduce vision impairment and improve quality of life for millions affected by uncorrected refractive errors worldwide."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "What is measles and who is at risk?", "answer": "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death. Measles can affect anyone who is not immune but is most common in children."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "How does measles spread? How contagious is it?", "answer": "The virus is so contagious that 90% of people who are not immune and who come into contact with an infected person will become infected and develop the disease. Measles is normally spread through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. The measles virus can live for up to 2 hours on a surface or in the air. If other people breathe in the contaminated air or touch the infected surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected. An infected person can spread the virus even before they have typical symptoms (e.g. rash)."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "How serious is measles? What are the symptoms and how can I protect my child?", "answer": "Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Measles is a highly contagious and potentially serious disease. Most deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease. Complications are most common in children under 5 years and adults over age 30. One in 5 children infected with the measles virus may develop severe complications. Complications can include: blindness encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage) severe diarrhoea and related dehydration ear infections that can lead to permanent deafness severe breathing problems including pneumonia. Measles infection has also been shown to weaken a person’s immune system, making it more difficult for them to fight off other diseases for months or even years after being sick with measles. If a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight. The only way to stop measles is to prevent it through vaccination. Measles vaccine is safe and effective. Two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MR/measles-rubella) provide 97% protection from infection and the potentially serious consequences of the disease. For most people this protection is lifelong."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "How can measles be treated?", "answer": "There is no specific treatment\r\nfor measles. Drinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace\r\nfluids lost to diarrhea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important. Doctors may use antibiotics to\r\ntreat secondary bacterial pneumonia and ear and eye infections. Giving the\r\nvaccine or immunoglobulin in the early stage after infection may sometimes\r\nprevent severe disease. All children and adults with measles should receive 2\r\ndoses of vitamin A supplements given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin\r\nA levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye\r\ndamage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of\r\ndeaths due to measles."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "What should people do if they suspect they might have measles?", "answer": "If you suspect that you or your\r\nchild has measles, you need to contact your health-care provider as soon as\r\npossible and let them know about your symptoms or concerns. Your health-care\r\nprovider may decide to make special arrangements to evaluate you, if needed,\r\nwithout putting others at risk."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "Can the measles-containing vaccine make my child sick?", "answer": "Most children don’t develop any\r\nside effects from the measles-containing vaccine. Side effects that may occur\r\nare usually mild and may include soreness, redness, or mild swelling at the\r\ninjection site. Fever lasting 2–3 days, mild flu-like symptoms, and a mild rash\r\ncan occur 7–10 days after vaccination but are not cause for concern. More serious adverse reactions\r\nfollowing immunization are extremely rare. The risk of serious outcomes from\r\nmeasles is far higher than the risk of side effects from the vaccine. Allergic reactions to the\r\nvaccine are possible but extremely rare. Measles vaccines should not be given\r\nto a child or adult with a history of anaphylactic reactions or severe allergic\r\nreactions to any component of the vaccine (e.g. neomycin or gelatin). Measles vaccination\r\noccasionally induces febrile seizures. Most children recover quickly from\r\nfebrile seizures and they have no lasting effects."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "When should I have my child vaccinated against measles?", "answer": "Talk to your health-care provider to find out when your child is eligible for the vaccine. If your child has missed any scheduled doses, they could be vulnerable to very serious diseases. Make an appointment to catch up as soon as possible. WHO recommends two doses of measles-containing vaccine for children. The first dose is given at 9 months of age, and the second dose is given at 15-18 months of age. In areas where measles outbreaks are occurring, WHO recommends vaccination from 6 months of age, but doses of measles vaccine given before 9 months of age are considered a bonus or dose number “zero”. Children then receive two doses of measles-containing vaccine at 9 months and 15-18 months as mentioned above."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "How effective is the measles vaccine?", "answer": "A single dose of MR (measles-rubella) vaccine is approximately 84% effective against measles.  After a second MR dose, protection increases to up to 97% against measles. It is extremely unlikely to develop measles once vaccinated, and in those few cases, symptoms are generally milder."}
{"topic": "/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles", "question": "What should I do if I’m not sure whether I’m immune to measles?", "answer": "If you do not have written\r\ndocumentation of measles immunity, consult your health-care provider about\r\ngetting vaccinated. There is no harm in getting another dose of MMR vaccine if\r\nyou may already be immune to measles (or mumps or rubella)."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "What is public health surveillance?", "answer": "Public health surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data, in order to plan, implement and evaluate public health practice. Public health surveillance is performed routinely to monitor disease trends, and also plays a vital role in responding to epidemics. It can be done by using door-to-door surveys, web surveys, disease registries, laboratory data, and so on. Newer tools currently being employed or considered include data from social networks, genetic data, and non-health related data from various sources."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "Why are ethics important in public health surveillance?", "answer": "The effectiveness of public health surveillance as a basis for stemming the spread of disease depends on trust: can the people whose data are being collected trust that it will be used to protect their health? If there is no trust, people will not agree to share their data, or if they do, it will be unreliable. Public health surveillance, conducted in a manner that anticipates ethical challenges and seeks proactively to reduce unnecessary risks, will go a long way in building and maintaining trust of the affected populations."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "How should communities be involved in public health surveillance?", "answer": "Agencies or organizations that conduct public health surveillance should take account of community values, concerns, and priorities in a transparent manner. Communities can’t be engaged if they have no means of knowing about the benefits, and risks (or potential for harm) of surveillance. Active engagement of the community may involve meetings with community leaders, focus group discussions, and other forums that provide an opportunity for members to clearly express their values and concerns. In whatever manner the community is engaged, it is critical that decision-making be transparent, fair, and open to revision. The active inclusion and participation of communities fosters trust and creates conditions for citizens to advance the common good individually and collectively."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "How are surveillance ethics different from research ethics?", "answer": "The principle guiding values in research ethics are autonomy, privacy and confidentiality. By contrast, the ethics of public health surveillance focuses on the common good, solidarity, accountability, trust and balancing of individual rights with collective interests."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "How can potential harms from public health surveillance be avoided?", "answer": "Identifiable information like names and addresses of individuals are sometimes part of surveillance records. Using unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names is one way to prevent identities from being inadvertently disclosed. Another is “geo-masking”, which preserves vital information on the spatial distribution of cases but does not pinpoint exactly where the clusters of cases are. Assessing the legal protections for those who might be particularly susceptible to harm is another strategy for ensuring that, in advance of surveillance, broad social protections are in place. In many nations, laws requiring surveillance are paired not only with security protections but clear protections of economic, social, and civil rights."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "Should public health data be shared, and if so, who with?", "answer": "In the context of emergency situations, rapid data sharing is imperative. It is also appropriate to share public health data for legitimate research purposes that have been approved by an ethics review committee. But data collected in the name of the public health should never be shared for the purpose of taking action against individuals or for uses unrelated to public health. Access to such personal information by agencies responsible for national security, law enforcement, or the allocation of social benefits should usually be allowed only after legal due process. To preserve trust in public health surveillance systems, there should be a compelling justification for sharing identifiable data for non-public health uses."}
{"topic": "/q-a-ethics-in-public-health-surveillance", "question": "Why is oversight important?", "answer": "An engaged oversight body can help to identify ethical issues when they arise, consider new evidence or emerging best practices, and deal with vexing problems in an accountable, transparent manner. Decisions that may require ethical oversight include collecting data that reveal stigmatized behaviour; adopting new uses for existing surveillance data, such as for case management or contact tracing; or using public health surveillance data for commercial or security purposes. Oversight is also important to ensure that there is active monitoring for harms and appropriate data sharing. But mechanisms for the ethical oversight can also help to ensure that states meet their obligations to conduct surveillance responsibly."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What is HIV?", "answer": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets cells of the immune system, called CD4 cells, which help the body respond to infection. Within the CD4 cell, HIV replicates and in turn, damages and destroys the cell. Without effective treatment of a combination of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, the immune system will become weakened to the point that it can no longer fight infections and diseases."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "Is AIDS different from HIV?", "answer": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a term that applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection. It is defined by the occurrence of any of the more than 20 life-threatening cancers or “opportunistic infections”, so named because\r\n    they take advantage of a weakened immune system. AIDS was a defining feature of the earlier years of the HIV epidemic, before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available. Now, as more people access ART, the majority of people living with HIV will\r\n    not progress to AIDS. Advanced HIV disease (AHD) , defined as having a CD4 cell count less than 200 copies, having an AIDS-defining illness, or all children less than 5 years old with confirmed HIV infection, is more likely to occur in people\r\n    with HIV who have not been tested, in people who are diagnosed late, and in people who have stopped or never started taking ART."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "Without treatment, how quickly can a person living with HIV become ill?", "answer": "For people living with HIV who are not diagnosed or taking ART, signs of HIV-related illness may develop within 5–10 years, although it can be sooner. The time between HIV transmission and an AIDS diagnosis is usually 10-15 years, but sometimes longer. There is a very small number of people who have managed to control the HIV infection without ART and are called ‘elite-controllers’. This situation is very rare and most people will need ART to avoid becoming ill."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How is HIV transmitted?", "answer": "HIV is found in certain bodily fluids of people living with HIV, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids and breastmilk. HIV can be transmitted by: unprotected vaginal or anal sex, and, in very rare cases, through oral sex with a person living with HIV; blood transfusion of contaminated blood; sharing of needles, syringes, other injecting equipment, surgical equipment or other sharp instruments; and from a mother living with HIV to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. A person living with HIV who is taking ART and whose viral load is “undetectable” will not transmit HIV to their sexual partner/s."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How is HIV infection treated?", "answer": "While there is no cure for HIV infection, it can be treated using antiretroviral drugs, which work by stopping the replication of the virus. ART can reduce the level of virus to such low levels in the body that the immune system will function normally, and a person living with HIV can enjoy good health, provided they adhere to treatment and the treatment remains effective. People living with HIV are also much less likely to transmit the virus to others when treatment is working."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What does “undetectable” mean?", "answer": "Evidence from several studies show that people living with HIV who have an “undetectable” viral load cannot pass HIV on to others. A person is “undetectable” when ART has reduced the level of virus in their body to such low levels that it cannot be detected by normal viral load tests. Monitoring of viral load, and confirmation of an undetectable viral load is often undertaken by a healthcare professional as part of the routine medical care for people with HIV. In many low- and middle-income countries, viral load tests may not be consistently or routinely available, so many people do not benefit from the knowledge that they are undetectable. They can be assured, however, that the risk of transmitting HIV is greatly reduced when they adhere to treatment, and when treatment is started without delay."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What illnesses can affect people living with HIV?", "answer": "ART allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives by ensuring that their immune system remains healthy. In certain settings, however, many people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, not on treatment, or not taking consistent treatment, and, as a result their HIV disease progresses. People with HIV who develop severe immunodeficiency and are not on antiretroviral treatment frequently develop severe opportunistic infections and some rare cancers as Kaposi Sarcoma. Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one cause of death among people living with HIV in Africa, and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide. Routine TB-symptom screening and early initiation of ART can greatly improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV. Other common HIV coinfections include hepatitis B and C in some populations. HIV infection can result in a range of health problems. As people living with HIV age and live longer, non-AIDS defining illnesses are becoming more common. These include heart disease, cancer and diabetes."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How can people get tested for HIV?", "answer": "Testing for HIV is the only way to know if a person has HIV or not. HIV can be diagnosed using rapid diagnostic tests that provide results within minutes. However, such results should only be considered as a full diagnosis following review and confirmation\r\n    by a qualified health worker. Knowledge of one’s HIV-positive status has two important benefits: People who test positive can take steps to get treatment, care and support before symptoms appear, which can prolong life and prevent health complications for many years. People who are aware of their status can take precautions to prevent the transmission of HIV to others. WHO recommends that HIV tests be made available in all health facilities and through a range of community settings.  People can also use HIV self-test kits to test themselves. People using self-tests and have a positive result should always get this confirmed at a health centre."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "Who is at more risk of HIV?", "answer": "The main routes of HIV transmission include unsafe sex without condoms, receiving blood transfusions or other blood products contaminated with HIV, sharing of needles and syringes and other injecting equipment, being exposed to HIV through contaminated surgical and other skin piercing equipment and vertical transmission from mothers with HIV to their children. HIV is fully preventable; different interventions exist to stop transmission. However, many people are not accessing necessary information and skills to prevent HIV. In some cases, major legal and social barriers prevent people from accessing effective prevention services and measures. Some populations are at higher risk of HIV infection, including men who have sex with men ; people who inject drugs ; People in prisons and other closed settings ; sex workers and their clients ; and transgender people . These populations are referred to as ‘key populations’, who are often marginalized in communities and experience major barriers in accessing HIV prevention and treatment and other health services. In some settings, other populations may be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, such as adolescent girls in southern Africa."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How can sexual transmission of HIV be prevented?", "answer": "Globally, HIV is mainly transmitted through unprotected vaginal and anal sex. Several methods can be used to prevent this from happening. It is recommended that a combination of effective prevention interventions be used, including: using male and/or female condoms consistently and correctly; for HIV-negative people, taking pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission; for people living with HIV, taking ART to reduce viral load to undetectable levels, meaning they can’t transmit HIV to their sexual partners; for adolescent boys and men in high HIV burden settings, voluntary medical male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV; diagnosing and treating other STIs; and being aware of one’s status and for people with HIV stay on ART to prevent transmission to their partner/s."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What is the relationship between HIV and other STIs?", "answer": "HIV infection is more likely to occur if a person has another sexually transmitted infection (STI) and vice-versa. The probability of infection by HIV or other sexually transmitted pathogens significantly increases when people engage in risky sexual behaviours (e.g. no condom use, unprotected sex with multiple partners; sex under the influence of drugs and alcohol). Additionally, sores and inflammations from some STIs facilitate HIV infection. Evidence indicates that genital herpes (HSV-2) almost triples the risk of acquiring HIV in both men and women. Also, women living with HIV are at high risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer, among several other examples."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How can transmission through the sharing of needle/syringes be prevented?", "answer": "Harm reduction interventions aim to reduce the harms associated with injecting drug use , including HIV and viral hepatitis without necessarily stopping drug use. The provision of sterile needle/syringes and other injecting equipment through needle/syringe programmes helps people who inject drugs to use a sterile needle/syringe at each injection, reducing their risk of HIV. Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is an evidence-based treatment for opioid dependence which reduces HIV risk and has other health benefits."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How can vertical transmission of HIV be prevented?", "answer": "HIV can be transmitted from a mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. But such vertical transmission can be prevented with effective interventions, including the use of ART by the mother and a short course of antiretroviral drugs for the baby. Other effective interventions include measures to prevent HIV acquisition in pregnant woman, prevent unintended pregnancies in women with HIV and appropriate breastfeeding practices. HIV testing services should be integrated into maternal and child health services, so that they women at risk can readily access testing. Pregnant women and mothers diagnosed with HIV should receive ART as soon as possible, so that their children are born free from HIV."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What is PrEP?", "answer": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis , or PrEP, is a course of antiretroviral drugs that HIV-negative people can take to prevent HIV acquisition. When taken as recommended, it can practically eliminate the chance of acquiring HIV. PrEP is recommended for populations who are at higher risk of HIV. These groups may include men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who use drugs, and young women in southern Africa. Long acting PrEP products have also been shown to be effective in preventing HIV acquisition. A monthly vaginal ring for women and an intramuscular injection given every 8 weeks for men, women and transgender diverse populations are both effective. Although currently not widely available there are currently global efforts to increase access."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How does male circumcision prevent HIV transmission?", "answer": "Male circumcision reduces the risk of sexual transmission from a woman to a man by around 60%. A one-time intervention, medical male circumcision provides life-long partial protection against HIV, as well as other sexually transmitted infections. It should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, and should not replace other known methods of prevention, such as female and male condoms. The minimum package of services should include:  safer sex education, promotion of condoms, management of STIs, HIV testing, linkage to treatment for men and adolescents 15 years and older in high HIV burden settings."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "How effective are condoms in preventing HIV?", "answer": "When used correctly and consistently every time a person has sex, condoms are among the most effective means of preventing HIV infection in women and men."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "Is there a cure for HIV?", "answer": "No, there is currently no cure for HIV. Science is moving at a fast pace, and there have been 3 people who have achieved a ‘functional cure’ by undergoing a bone marrow transplant for cancer with re-infusion of new CD4 T cells that are unable to be infected with HIV. However, neither a cure nor a vaccine is available to treat and protect all people currently living with or at risk of HIV. But with good and continued adherence to ART, HIV infection can be contained and managed as a chronic health condition. In all parts of the world, people living with HIV are now surviving and thriving into old age."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What other kinds of care do people living with HIV need?", "answer": "While ART helps the immune system stay strong, people living with HIV can benefit from counselling and psychosocial support to ensure that they are truly “living well” with HIV. HIV is manageable, but it is a life-long chronic illness, and people may need support with their mental health and with lifestyle changes to support good health through life. Access to good nutrition, safe water and basic hygiene can also help people living with HIV to maintain a good quality of life. As with the general community, people living with HIV may experience a broad range of other health conditions that may need treatment and care. A people-centred approach to health care, particularly through primary health services, aims to deliver comprehensive health services to people living with HIV, in which all their health issues are addressed."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids", "question": "What is the intersection between HIV and monkeypox  ?", "answer": "People living with HIV may be at risk of developing monkeypox (mpox) because of weak immune systems. There is some evidence that being immunocompromised may increase your risk of becoming infected if you are exposed, and of having serious illness or dying from mpox. However, more data is needed to understand this fully. Many people with mpox in the current outbreak are also living with HIV, but there have been relatively few severe cases of mpox, likely because in most cases their HIV infection was well-controlled. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a high prevalence of HIV infection (52%; 14 573/28 006) has been reported among cases with known HIV status. Monkeypox and HIV share common behavioural risk factors such as transmission through sexual contact. Consideration should be given to testing any person with monkeypox infection for HIV infection if their status is not already known. People with multiple sexual partners, including people who are living with HIV, are encouraged to take steps to reduce their risk of being exposed to mpox by avoiding close contact with anyone who has symptoms and by avoiding high-risk situations where multiple contacts may occur even with persons who may not realize they have mpox. Reducing the number of sexual partners may reduce your risk."}
{"topic": "/trachoma", "question": "What is trachoma?", "answer": "Trachoma is a disease of the eye and the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis . After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical."}
{"topic": "/trachoma", "question": "How is the infection transmitted?", "answer": "The infection is transmitted by direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected people, particularly young children who harbour the principal reservoir of infection. These discharges can be spread by particular species of flies. In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with prevalence rates which can be as high as 60–90%. Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. The disease thrives especially in crowded living conditions where there are shortages of water, inadequate sanitation and where numerous eye-seeking flies are present. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently."}
{"topic": "/trachoma", "question": "Where does trachoma occur?", "answer": "Trachoma is a public health problem in many of the poorest and most rural areas of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. It causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide. Overall, Africa is the most affected continent, and the one with the most intensive control efforts. As of May 2024, elimination of trachoma as a public health problem had been validated by WHO in 18 countries (Benin, Cambodia, China, Gambia, Ghana, Iraq, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Togo and Vanuatu). A further 10 countries (Botswana, Burundi, Guatemala, India, Mauritania, Namibia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Tunisia and Viet Nam) report having achieved the prevalence targets for elimination."}
{"topic": "/trachoma", "question": "How is trachoma diagnosed?", "answer": "Trachoma is usually clinically diagnosed. People are examined for clinical signs by trained graders using magnifiers (loupes) and illumination from either the sun or a good torch. Conjunctival infection with ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis (the cause of trachoma) does not always generate visible signs of disease. However, infection can be accompanied by signs of inflammation known as active trachoma, and as it progresses through its natural history, trachoma becomes more and more obvious on examination. Repeated episodes of inflammation cause scarring of the conjunctiva that can progress to drying of the eye and in-turning of the eyelashes. The latter is known as trachomatous trichiasis. This can abrade the eyeball, causing constant profound irritation, reflex spasm of the eyelids and opacification of the cornea."}
{"topic": "/trachoma", "question": "What are the clinical signs and how can trachoma be treated?", "answer": "Ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as active trachoma. The WHO simplified trachoma grading system includes five signs. Treatment involves antibiotics to clear infection and surgery for the most advanced cases. Signs and their associated treatment are listed below. Trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF) – The presence of five or more follicles, each at least 0.5 mm in diameter, in the central part of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Management: Give antibiotics (single-dose oral azithromycin 20mg/kg body weight, to a maximum of 1g, or 1% topical tetracycline eye ointment into both eyes twice a day for six weeks). Consider evaluating the population in which the patient lives for the prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds and TT in ≥15-year-olds, which might indicate a need for population-based implementation of the SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination. Trachomatous inflammation–intense (TI) – Pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels. Management: Give antibiotics (regimens as above). Consider evaluating the population in which the patient lives for the prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds and TT in ≥15-year-olds, which might indicate a need for population-based implementation of the SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination. Trachomatous scarring (TS) – The presence of easily visible scarring in the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Scars are white lines, bands, or sheets. Management: There is no specific treatment for this sign. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) – At least one eyelash from the upper eyelid touches the eyeball, or evidence of recent epilation of in-turned eyelashes from the upper eyelid. Management: Measure visual acuity. Refer the individual to the nearest eye unit for management, which might involve eyelid surgery or regular epilation. Consider evaluating the population in which the patient lives for the prevalence of TF in 1–9-year-olds and TT in ≥15-year-olds, which might indicate a need for population-based implementation of the SAFE strategy for trachoma elimination. Corneal opacity (CO) – Easily visible corneal opacity that is so dense that at least part of the pupil margin is blurred when viewed through the opacity. Vision is likely to be affected. Management: Measure visual acuity. Refer the individual to the nearest eye unit for management, which should involve management of TT if still present."}
{"topic": "/trachoma", "question": "How can trachoma be prevented and controled?", "answer": "Elimination programmes in endemic countries are being implemented using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy. This consists of: S urgery to treat the blinding stage (trachomatous trichiasis); A ntibiotics to clear infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to elimination programmes, through the International Trachoma Initiative; F acial cleanliness; and E nvironmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation. Most endemic countries have agreed to accelerate the implementation of this strategy to achieve elimination targets."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is the Universal health coverage global monitoring report?", "answer": "The Universal health coverage global monitoring report (UHC GMR) is the official monitoring tool of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.8.1 ( health service coverage ) and SDG 3.8.2 ( financial hardship ) . The report is jointly prepared every other year by WHO and the World Bank."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What data does the report use?", "answer": "The data used to measure the service coverage dimension of UHC are derived from a combination of reported administrative data (from countries), survey-derived estimates (from countries and agencies that conduct surveys such as demographic and health surveys and multiple indicator cluster surveys), and modelled estimates (from WHO technical programmes). The report presents country, regional and global estimates of service coverage for the following reference years: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021. More detailed information on specific data sources can be found in annex 1 of the 2023 UHC GMR. The report presents global and regional estimates of financial hardship for six reference years in the 2000–2019 period (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019). The reference year estimates are projections based on data from almost 1000 household surveys from 167 countries representing over 90% of the world’s population, and modelled estimates for the remaining countries and territories for which no household survey data were available. In addition, the report provides estimates of financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic for the 23 countries that continued to collect household survey data in 2020 or 2021. More detailed information on specific data sources can be found in annex 10 of the 2023 UHC GMR."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) and how is it calculated?", "answer": "The inclusive nature of UHC and its emphasis on providing quality health services that address needs across the life course pose unique challenges for monitoring SDG 3.8.1. No single index can fully capture all the health services included in UHC. The current UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) therefore uses a selection of indicators to represent overall coverage of essential health services across the entire population in a country. A basket of representative essential health services is combined into the SCI across four broad areas of service coverage: reproductive, newborn, maternal and child health; infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases; and service capacity and access. The SCI is calculated as the average score (out of 100) of 14 tracer indicators selected from these health areas for each country. The regional and global aggregates are calculated as the population-weighted averages of the country-level SCIs. It is most useful to make comparisons over time across levels of the SCI: very high service coverage (index of 80 and above), high service coverage (index between 60 and 79), medium service coverage (index between 40 and 59), low service coverage (index between 20 and 39) and very low service coverage (index <20)."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending?", "answer": "Catastrophic health spending refers to people incurring large out-of-pocket health spending relative to their total consumption or income. Specifically, SDG 3.8.2 considers people as suffering catastrophic health spending if their household’s out-of-pocket health spending exceeds 10% or 25% of the household’s income or consumption. As such, catastrophic spending can affect households of all income or consumption levels. Catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending reduces the ability of households to consume other essential goods and services like food, shelter, clothing or education. Those living in or near poverty are particularly vulnerable to being forced to reduce their consumption of necessities due to out-of-pocket health spending which, in turn, may lead to a perpetual vicious cycle of poor health and poverty. For more information consult the SDG 3.8.2 metadata ."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is impoverishing health spending?", "answer": "Indicators of impoverishing health spending complement SDG 3.8.2 catastrophic spending indicators by recognizing that even small out-of-pocket payments in absolute terms can threaten the living standards of people living near or in poverty. Indeed, spending on very basic needs such as food absorbs a much larger share of poorer households’ income. As a result, in absolute terms poorer households may not be able to spend much, if anything, on health care. That is why indicators of impoverishing health spending identify: people living in poverty that are spending any amount on health directly out of their own pocket. These people are further impoverished by such payments as they are going deeper into poverty because of them and; people who had to reduce their consumption below the subsistence levels identified by the poverty line due to the absolute amounts they spent on health out-of-pocket. These people are impoverished or pushed into poverty by out-of-pocket health payments. Therefore, out-of-pocket health spending is considered as impoverishing if it either pushes or further pushes people below the poverty line. For more information, please consult box 2.2 and annexes 7 and 8 of Tracking universal health coverage: 2023 global monitoring report ."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "Are \"impoverishing health spending\" from the report and \"living in or going deeper into poverty due to health costs\" from the media the same?", "answer": "The indicators of impoverishing health spending aim to capture the impact of out-of-pocket health spending on subsistence levels. In the media the language is less technical to facilitate the understanding of the issues. Those identified as going deeper into poverty due to health care costs include both those impoverished and further impoverished (or pushed and further pushed) by out-of-pocket health spending as in both cases they become poorer. However, when reference is made to those living in poverty it concerns only those that are further impoverished, for example they are poor even in the absence of any out-of-pocket health spending but paying for health directly worsened their living condition by reducing even further their basic consumption below minimum levels to secure essential necessities."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "The report shows that in 2019 an estimated 344 million people are impoverished and further impoverished by out-of-pocket health spending at the extreme poverty line, how many of them are living in extreme poverty?", "answer": "The 344 million with impoverishing out-of-pocket health spending at the extreme poverty line include: 55 million people impoverished or pushed into extreme poverty; and 289 million people further impoverished or further pushed into extreme poverty. These are the people living in extreme poverty and spending on health out-of-pocket. In the media, this number is rounded to about 300 million people living in extreme poverty."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "Why are there so many population estimates related to financial hardship?", "answer": "The report shows that in 2019, 1 billion people faced catastrophic health spending from spending more than 10% of their household budget on health out of their own pocket. The report also shows that 1.3 billion were pushed or further pushed into relative poverty by out-of-pocket health spending. However, the overall total number of people facing any form of financial hardship is only 2 billion people. This is because indicators of catastrophic and impoverishing out-of-pocket health spending are not mutually exclusive – people might be affected by neither, one or both. There is an overlap, but the report shows that the estimated overlap is small. For more information, see section 2.2.2 of the 2023 UHC GMR."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is the difference between relative and extreme poverty?", "answer": "The extreme poverty line, defined as 2.15 purchasing-power-adjusted US dollars per person per day, reflects a global threshold under which a person’s most basic needs cannot be met. Consumption above this threshold, however, does not mean the absence of poverty. This is why the 2023 UHC GMR also presents findings for impoverishment due to healthcare costs for a relative poverty line. The relative poverty line determines if a person is considered poor by comparing their consumption not to an absolute poverty line like US$ 2.15/day, but to the average consumption of other people in the same country or territory. Specifically for this report, this is defined as those whose consumption lies below 60% of the median per capita consumption in their country."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "The report also shows that 344 million people are pushed or further pushed into extreme poverty. Are those part of the 1.3 billion people pushed or further pushed into relative poverty?", "answer": "There is an overlap, but it hasn’t been estimated yet. This will be done for the next global report. For more information, please consult box 2.2. of the 2023 UHC GMR."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "The report mentions that 4.5 billion people are not fully covered by essential health services and 2 billion people faced financial hardship. Are these the same people?", "answer": "There is an overlap, but the extent of the overlap is still under investigation. The methodologies, including data sources, used to estimate those fully covered by essential health services and those who faced financial hardship are very different, and therefore it is not straightforward to assess. For more information on the methodologies please consult annex 1, annex 9 and section 2.2. of the 2023 UHC GMR."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "How recent is the data in the UHC GMR 2023 report?", "answer": "The most recent year for the service coverage index depends on data availability and the process of publishing SDG 3.8.1. At the global level, data sources for service coverage have lag times which means that the data is not immediately available for all countries but rather takes time to move through the various data collection, validation and reporting systems. The estimates published in the 2023 UHC GMR are not living estimates that are continuously updated, but rather provide a snapshot of a specific time period. In the case of the 2023 report, the time period assessed for service coverage is 2000–2021. Data assessment for each update of the time series begins about 18 months prior to publication in each report and can include new data for any year since 2000 that may have become available since the last report. The global and regional estimates of financial hardship in this report are available until 2019 and based on data from over 1000 nationally representative household budget and multipurpose surveys."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect data collection and progress monitoring?", "answer": "Most countries do not conduct such surveys every year and, typically, the survey data become available for analysis only 1–2 years after being collected. Even in the best of times, both factors limit the recency of the global and regional estimates of financial hardship that the global monitoring reports can provide. Both factors were also severely exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought household survey data collection and processing to an almost complete halt. For instance, at the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020, 96% of 122 National Statistical Offices interviewed for a study of COVID-19-related data collection disruptions reported that face-to-face data collection had stopped completely. By May 2021, only 44% of 118 national statistical offices had resumed face-to-face data collection. Data availability was thus insufficient for this report to provide global or regional estimates of financial hardship for 2020 or later. However, the report does present evidence on financial hardship during the pandemic from 23 countries which continued their household survey programs in 2020 and 2021."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "Did COVID-19 have an impact on progress toward UHC?", "answer": "While the available evidence points towards an adverse impact of COVID-19 on service coverage, stagnated essential health services expansion has been observed since 2015. The global service coverage index did not change at all between 2019 and 2021, with a global index of 68 out of 100. However, subregional and country-level decreases were observed in some dimensions of the service coverage index, alongside significant acute disruptions in delivering health services not captured by the annual index at the global level. While a lack of data made it impossible to compute global and regional estimates of financial protection for the 2020–2022 period, evidence from a small sample of countries with data collected during the pandemic indicates a worsening of financial hardship in the general population, particularly among the poor, as well as an uneven and unfinished recovery. Both indicators for UHC require modern, fit-for-purpose health and financial information systems to regularly report data and improve the timeliness of progress tracking and guide policy design. This is a key call to action in the 2023 UHC GMR."}
{"topic": "/tracking-universal-health-coverage", "question": "How can governments and experts use the findings of the report?", "answer": "While the evidence presented in this report is global and regional, specific policy recommendations strongly depend on country contexts. Some general lessons can also be drawn from the worrying global and regional trends in service coverage and financial hardship, and the challenges in data availability as noted above. Reaching the goal of UHC by 2030 requires substantial public and private sector investment and accelerated action by governments and partners. This includes reorienting health systems to a primary health care approach bolstering frontline and community healthcare workers and promoting the latest advancements in digital health and technology to advance equity in both the delivery of essential health services and financial protection. To enable governments and experts to carry out additional and country-specific analyses, the global, regional and country level data presented in this report are freely available to the public via WHO’s Global Health Observatory ."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "Is UV damage avoidable?", "answer": "UV damage is mostly avoidable. The rise in the incidence of skin cancers over the past decades is strongly related to occupational and recreational UV exposure. Overexposure to UV radiation is recognized as the underlying cause for harmful effects on the skin, eye, and the immune system. In some cultures, a tan may be cosmetically desirable and has established itself as a symbol of attractiveness and good health. But there is nothing healthy about a tan. It results from your skin trying to prevent further damage. With proper protection, four out of five cases of skin cancer could be prevented. And adopting simple precautions can make all the difference."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "How can I safely enjoy the sun?", "answer": "There are many physical and psychological benefits of outdoor activities. These need to be balanced with protecting the skin from the known adverse effects of UV radiation. Proper sun protection measures are outlined below. Limit time in the midday sun The sun's UV rays are the strongest two hours before to two hours after solar noon. To the extent possible, limit UV exposure during these hours, particularly during the spring and summer months. You can safely be outdoors in the early morning and late afternoon hours with a much-reduced risk of getting burnt. Watch for the UV Index The UV Index (UVI) is a measure of the level of UV radiation. The values of the index range from zero upward - the higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. This important resource helps you plan your outdoor activities in ways that prevent overexposure to UV radiation. While you should always take precautions against overexposure, take special care to adopt UV radiation safety practices when the UV Index is 3 or above. UV index values for your region or particular location may be found, for example, on the websites of weather services, and on weather apps or on the SunSmart Global UV App , which also displays sun protection times. Use shade wisely Seek shade when UV radiation is the most intense. Keep in mind that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or canopies do not offer complete UV protection. Don't forget that you are still exposed to UV from scattered radiation and reflections, especially in the snow, or in areas with bright surfaces like water surfaces, sandy beaches, or white buildings. Wear protective gear The best UV protection when outdoors is achieved with the use of clothing. A hat with a wide brim offers UV protection for the eyes, ears, face, and the back of the neck. Tightly woven clothes protect the skin, and wraparound style sunglasses that provide 100% UV-A and UV-B protection greatly reduce eye damage from sun exposure. Use sunscreen Use broad-spectrum sunscreen on skin areas that cannot be covered by clothes. Sun protection is best achieved by seeking shade and wearing clothes rather than applying sunscreens. Sunscreens should not be used for extending time spent in the sun: while they can delay the onset of sunburn, they cannot completely block UV radiation. It is recommended to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen (UV-A and UV-B protection) of at least SPF 30 liberally (3 to 4 heaped tablespoons for the entire adult body). Re-apply every two hours, in particular after sweating, swimming, playing, or exercising outdoors. Avoid sunbeds Sunbeds are designed to emit strong levels of UV radiation. There is a clear association between sunbed use and skin cancer. The beneficial effects of sunbed use, such as generation of vitamin D, are outweighed by the adverse effects. Therefore, sunbeds are best avoided entirely. Several countries have implemented legislation to ban or restrict the use of sunbeds."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "When is sun protection necessary?", "answer": "Time of year You should generally be careful between spring and early autumn when the sun's rays are most intense. In the tropics and near the equator, year-round protection from UV radiation may be necessary depending on your skin type. Time of day Little UV radiation reaches the Earth during early morning or late afternoon hours. But UV levels can be very high during midday time, i.e. 2 hours before to 2 hours after solar noon. Vacation time When on vacation in sunny locations, there can be a serious risk of suddenly being exposed to intense UV radiation. For fair-skinned people in particular, such intermittent exposure is a serious risk factor for skin cancer. It is therefore important to be aware of your own UV sensitivity and to protect yourself from UV radiation. Reflective surfaces Surfaces can reflect UV radiation and thus intensify the UV radiation to levels above the daily peak UV index value. Snow, for example can reflect 90% of UV radiation while white facades around 20% of UV radiation. Make sure you protect yourself against UV especially when you go skiing, do water sports or spend extended time on a light-coloured beach."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "Does sunscreen offer good protection?", "answer": "Sunscreens offer a way of protecting your skin against harmful effects of UV radiation. However, they cannot completely block UV radiation and should be used in combination with other methods such as sun avoidance and clothing. Remember that the aim of applying sunscreen is not to prolong your stay in the sun. Sunscreens may contain physical or chemical UV radiation filters. While physical UV filters reflect or scatter the UV rays, chemical UV filters act by absorbing the UV radiation. Today's broad spectrum sunscreens filter UV radiation in the UV-A and the UV-B range. The sun protection factor (SPF) specifies the degree of protection against UVB radiation, not UVA radiation."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "What kind of sunscreen should I use and how?", "answer": "Always use a sunscreen that filters out both UVA and UVB and has an SPF of 30 or higher. To achieve good protection, apply the sunscreen thickly and evenly to all exposed parts of your body 20 to 30 minutes before going outside. Pay particular attention to the most exposed parts such as ears, nose, forehead, and neck. You should re-apply the sunscreen every two hours, and especially after bathing and sweating, as sunscreen is wiped off when drying off. The use of a lip balm containing a sunscreen also protects against recurrent lip eruptions of cold sores. A number of studies have shown that most people do not apply sufficient amounts of sunscreen and therefore do not achieve the specified SPF.  Approximately 35 ml of sunscreen must be applied to the total body surface of an adult to result in the quoted SPF. It is better to apply too much sunscreen than too little. Sunscreens are not to be confused with after-sun creams which moisturize or soothe dry and sunburnt skin. After-sun lotions neither protect against UV radiation nor repair UV-induced DNA damage."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "Is it true that clothing always provides good UV protection?", "answer": "Clothing provides the best barrier from the sun. Clothing together with a wide-brimmed hat, shoes and sunglasses are the essentials for your summer sun protection kit. Several factors determine the effectiveness of clothing in protecting against UV radiation. Several factors determine the effectiveness of fabrics in protecting against UV radiation, such as the clothing design, fabric structure (knitted or woven yarn), pore size, fiber thickness and composition of the material. Other factors include the fabric’s colour, finishing treatment (e.g. impregnation or use of UV-resistant substances) as well as whether the garment is wet or dry. Less UV passes through tightly woven or knitted fabrics. Darker colours usually block more UV radiation. Garments that are over-stretched, wet or worn out may lose some of their UV protection properties. Synthetic fibers (lycra, polyester) generally provide better protection than cotton, particularly when the garment is wet. Some UV textiles are available with a garment labeling called the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF). The UPF is a measure of the protection provided by an item of clothing against UV radiation (both UVB and UVA). It is the equivalent of the sun protection factor or SPF for sunscreens. The higher the UPF value, the less UV radiation reaches the skin and the better the protection against sunburn and other harmful effects. For example, a UPF 50 fabric blocks 98% of the sun's rays and allows 2% (1/50th) to penetrate the fabric. Such textiles may be useful for those who practice outdoor spots and/or jobs."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "What are the right sunglasses?", "answer": "Just as with the skin, UV exposure to the eye is cumulative over a lifetime and may cause irreversible damage. Sunglasses help your vision and protect your eyes. They make you feel more comfortable under bright light conditions as they reduce glare and improve contrast. You cannot tell how much UV radiation a pair of sunglasses block based on the color of the lenses, their darkness, or their price. UV transmission through sunglasses varies considerably. However, most sunglasses on sale filter a large percentage of UV radiation. For sunglasses to be fully protective against UV radiation, the lenses should absorb UV-A and UV-B radiation until 400 nanometers wavelength. You can recognize sunglasses with such protective lenses on the sign “UV400”. Also ask your optician for the filtering specifications, especially for sunglasses with visual acuity. Wraparound-style sunglasses offer enhanced protection of the eyes, especially for outdoor workers and athletes."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "What should I consider when I go travelling?", "answer": "UV radiation levels vary substantially with time and place. Therefore, you should check the UV index sat your location, which indicates the level of UV radiation. The increased risk of UV damage to the skin and eye during a vacation in a sunny location is often underestimated. Beyond the discomfort of sunburn, tourists are also at particular risk of long-term health effects on the eye and skin, especially skin ageing and skin cancer."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "Are children particularly vulnerable?", "answer": "Yes, children are more sensitive to UV radiation than adults, and therefore require special protection. Sunburns at any age, but especially in childhood, increase the risk of developing melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. Also, children have more time to develop diseases with long latency such as cancer, more years of life to be lost and more suffering to be endured because of impaired health."}
{"topic": "/radiation-protecting-against-skin-cancer", "question": "How can I care for children in the sun?", "answer": "Children themselves are usually not aware of the harmful effects of UV – it is their parents' or guardians' responsibility to protect their child from short-term and long-term damage. Always keep babies less than 12 months in the shade. Never let infants or young children sleep in the sun. Encourage your children to play in the shade. Make sure your children wear protective clothing, including a hat and sunglasses, when they go outdoors. Get your children used to wearing sunscreen. Apply sunscreen lotion with high protection generously and at least every two hours! Pay particular attention to the most exposed body parts, the face, neck, shoulders, back, knees and tops of feet. Do not allow children or teenagers to use sunbeds."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation", "question": "Do UV-A and UV-B affect the body in different ways?", "answer": "UV-A rays have longer wavelengths than UV-B rays, and thus penetrate deeper into the tissue layers of the eye and the skin. UV-A and UV-B rays also differ from each other by how strong their energy is, with UV-A rays having a lower amount of energy. UV-A and UV-B can therefore trigger different biological and health effects. The skin UV-A penetrates deep into the skin and can reach the dermis and subcutis, where connective tissue and blood vessels are affected, resulting in gradual loss of skin elasticity and premature ageing. UV-A darkens melanin pigment already present in the upper skin cells and creates a tan that appears quickly but also fades quickly. Most of UV-B is absorbed in the epidermis. UV-B stimulates the production of new melanin pigment within a few days, resulting in a tan that may last a relatively long time. UV-B also stimulates the cells to produce a thicker epidermis. Thus UV-B, together with UV-A, is responsible for the synthesis, darkening and thickening of the outer cell layers – these reactions are the body's defense against further UV damage. UV-B is the primary cause of sunburn. Sunburn is the result of overexposure and one serious factor which increases the risk of skin cancer. However, even doses of UV-B not high enough to cause sunburns may increase the likelihood of developing melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. Production of vitamin D is stimulated by UV-B radiation. The eye As for the skin, the UV-A and UV-B components of sun rays penetrate the eye to different depths. While UV-B radiation is completely absorbed by the cornea and lens, a small amount of UV-A penetrates through these and reaches the retina. It is under discussion whether this could cause retinal damage that manifests as health complications later in life. Among adults, around 1–2% of UV-A radiation is transmitted while for children, the transmittance is strongly age-dependent starting with transmittance of around 20% at birth and gradually decreases with age. Therefore, a child’s eye is more sensitive to UV radiation and requires special protection to prevent damage from UV exposure. The immune system Most experiments to date have concentrated on UV-B, as it appears to be more effective than UV-A in causing immunosuppression. There are hints that UV-A and UV-B radiation is absorbed by different molecules in the skin. This leads to changes in the distribution and activity of some of the key molecular and cellular players of the immune system. An altered balance of the immune response through cells and antibodies may reduce the body's ability to defend itself against certain diseases."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation", "question": "Are there beneficial effects of UV radiation?", "answer": "The only beneficial effect of UV, triggered by UV-B, is the stimulation of the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D has an important function in increasing calcium and phosphorus absorption from food and plays a crucial role in skeletal development, immune function, and blood cell formation. Thus, this beneficial effect from UV exposure must be weighed against the simultaneous adverse health effects to the eyes and skin. Based on current scientific knowledge, sufficient vitamin D synthesis is achieved by healthy people when exposing the face, hands, and arms uncovered and without sunscreen two to three times a week to half the time it would usually take unprotected skin to develop a sunburn (corresponding to around 12 minutes for sensitive people (skin type II)) with a UV index of 7. Vitamin D deficiency is possible for those who have very limited sun exposure, such as the elderly who are housebound or with age-related reduced vitamin D synthesis, those with dark pigmented skin who live in high-latitude countries where UV levels are relatively low, traditionally veiled persons, and people whose vitamin D metabolism does not function properly. Vitamin D deficiency should only be medically diagnosed and treated. Vitamin D supplementation or medication should be carried out under medical supervision. Recognizing the need for vitamin D, many countries have introduced supplements into common food like flour, cereals, and milk. Naturally occurring vitamin D is very rare in the human diet and is mainly present in fatty fish and cod liver oil. Most oral multivitamin tablets also contain adequate daily dose of vitamin D."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation", "question": "What are the harmful effects of UV on the skin?", "answer": "UV radiation can cause short- and long-term health effects on the skin. In addition to the well-known short-term effects such as sunburn or allergic reactions, long-term effects like skin cancer represent a chronic health risk. Skin cancer risk is strongly correlated with the duration and frequency of sun exposure over one’s lifetime. Cumulative UV dose is related to the development of squamous cell carcinoma while intermittent intense UV exposure and sunburn are related to melanoma. Suntan There is no such thing as a healthy tan! The skin produces a dark-coloured pigment, melanin, as a shield against further damage from UV radiation. The darkening provides some protection against sunburn. With a UV-A- and UV-B-induced tan a sun protection factor of between 2 and 4 can be achieved. However, it is no defence against long-term UV damage such as skin cancer. A suntan may be cosmetically desirable, but in fact it is a sign that your skin has been damaged and has attempted to protect itself. Sunburn Sunburn is an inflammation of the skin largely triggered by UV-B. This inflammation manifests as reddening and swelling of the affected areas of skin, as well as blistering in particularly serious cases. The resulting discomfort reaches its peak within 12 to 36 hours. Frequent sunburns during childhood and adolescence seriously increase the risk of developing skin cancer (melanoma). The occurrence of erythema remains the dermatological indicator for overexposure of the skin to UV radiation. However, DNA damage relevant to skin cancer can occur even before the erythema threshold is reached. Sun allergy \"Sun allergy\" refers to various skin conditions induced by UV radiation. The most common form of sun allergy is polymorphic light dermatosis. Following exposure to UV, in particular to UVA, the skin may develop patchy reddening, blisters, and nodules (papules) with an intense itching sensation, typically affecting the neck, upper chest, upper arms, backs of the hands, or thighs. The \"Mallorca acne\" is a special form of polymorphic light dermatosis whereby skin lesions are caused by the interaction of UV radiation and lipids from sunscreen (or the body’s own cutaneous sebum). Phototoxic reactions A set of substances that can be found in medications, herbal remedies and cosmetics like fragrances and soaps may provoke phototoxic reactions of the skin. These substances are said to have a photosensitizing effect. A minimal dose of UV radiation is sufficient to trigger an allergic reaction leading to rash or severe sunburn. Photosensitizing substances can also be found in certain plants and foods, such as citrus fruits, celery, or giant hogweed. If these plants are eaten or touched, subsequent exposure to UV radiation can lead to skin diseases. Premature skin ageing - the wrinkle factor Sun exposure promotes skin ageing due to a combination of several factors. Photoaging of the skin can frequently be observed in sun-exposed individuals who have spent much time outdoors. Both UV-B and UV-A contribute to photoaging. It is a gradual process, which is irreversible. The skin gradually loses its elasticity. Wrinkles, sags, and bags are the common result of this loss of elasticity. Skin Cancer UV radiation is the main cause of skin cancers, the most frequent cancers in fair-skinned populations. Risk factors for skin cancer include skin type, large congenital or clinically atypical moles, the number of moles, a family history of skin cancer, also acquired risk factors like immunosuppression-inducing diseases, and the UV exposure pattern the individual lifetime UV exposure (lifetime dose), intermittent UV exposures and sunburns. The major types of skin cancer are listed below in order of increasing severity and decreasing frequency. Basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinomas arises from skin epithelial cells and is the most common type of skin cancer. It is most frequent on those parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck, and forearms. The reported incidence has drastically increased over the past decades and continues to rise. They usually appear as a red lump or scaly area; however, no clear precursors have been identified. They grow slowly, rarely spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) but may form a deep sore if not removed surgically. Squamous cell carcinomas Squamous cell carcinomas also forms in the epithelial cells of the skin and is the second most common form of skin cancer. It appears as a thickened red scaly spot at body sites most often exposed to UV radiation and in which actinic keratosis forms as a precursor with sharply delimited reddening and a raw, sandpaper-like surface. As they sometimes metastasize, they are more dangerous than basal cell carcinomas. However, they also tend to be slow growing and can usually be removed surgically before they become a serious risk. Melanoma skin cancers Melanoma is the least common but the most dangerous type of skin cancer, accounting for most skin cancer deaths. It is caused by a malignancy of melanocytes and may arise as a new mole or as changes in colour, shape, size, or sensation of an old spot, freckle, or mole. Melanomas tend to have an irregular outline and a patchy colouring. Itching is another common symptom but is also found in normal moles. If recognized and treated early, the chances of survival are good. If untreated, the tumour can develop rapidly, and cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma may occur early in life, and its incidence is rapidly increasing worldwide. There is strong evidence that melanoma occurs due to intermittent UV exposure (occasional exposure to short periods of intense sunlight) and severe sunburns during childhood and adolescence."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation", "question": "What are the harmful effects of UV on the eye?", "answer": "During human evolution a number of mechanisms have evolved to protect the eye against effects of the sun's rays. The eye is recessed within the anatomy of the head and somewhat shielded by the eyebrow ridge and the eyelashes. Constriction of the pupil, closure of the eyelids and the squinting reflex minimize the penetration of the sun's rays into the eye. These mechanisms are activated by bright visible light and not by UV radiation – but on a cloudy day UV radiation exposure may still be high. Therefore, the effectiveness of these anatomical adaptations and natural defences in protecting against UV damage is limited. There are a number of acute and long-term effects of UV exposure on the eye. Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis Photokeratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, while photoconjunctivitis refers to an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and eye socket. These inflammatory reactions may be compared to a sunburn of the very sensitive skin-like tissues of the eyeball and eyelids and usually appear within a few hours of exposure. Photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis can be very painful, however, they are reversible and do not seem to result in any long-term damage to the eye or vision. An extreme form of photokeratitis is snow blindness. It sometimes occurs in skiers and climbers who experience extreme UV levels due to high altitude conditions and very strong ground reflection – fresh snow can reflect up to 80% of incident UV radiation. These extreme UV levels kill the outer cells of the eyeball leading to blindness. Snow blindness is very painful when the dead cells are being shed. In most cases new cells grow quickly, and vision is restored within a few days. Very severe snow blindness may involve complications such as chronic irritations or tearing. Pterygium This growth of the conjunctiva on the surface of the eye is a common condition associated with excessive solar exposure. It is generally accepted that UV exposure is linked to the formation of pterygia. Pterygium may extend over the centre of the cornea and thereby reduce vision. It also tends to become inflamed. Even though it can be removed by surgery, the outgrowth tends to recur. Climatic droplet keratopathy Climatic droplet keratopathy is a spheroidal degeneration of the superficial corneal stroma that is generally confined to geographical areas with high levels of UV exposure such as the arctic or tropics. Climatic droplet keratopathy is causally associated with chronic UV-A and UV-B exposure. Cataracts Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world. Proteins in the eye's lens unravel, tangle, and accumulate pigments which cloud the lens and eventually lead to blindness. Even though cataracts appear to different degrees in most individuals as they age, some studies strongly support UV-B as a risk factor for cortical cataract.  Cataracts can be surgically removed, and an artificial lens or other means of optical correction can restore vision. Every year some 16 million people in the world suffer from blindness due to a loss of transparency in the lens. WHO estimates suggest that up to 10% of cataracts may be caused by overexposure to UV radiation and are therefore avoidable. Cancer of the eye Current scientific evidence suggests that different forms of eye cancer may be associated with UV exposure. Uveal melanoma, the most frequent cancer of the eyeball, sometimes requires surgical removal and is associated with high mortality. Evidence of an association with ultraviolet exposure is mixed. Basal cell carcinoma, accounting for approximately 90% of all eyelid malignancies, and squamous cell carcinoma are the two most common tumors of the eyelid."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation", "question": "Does UV interact with the immune system?", "answer": "One of the main effects of UV radiation is its ability to suppress the body’s immunological response to antigens. UV exposure triggers a series of reactions in the skin that may lead to local, but possibly also systemic immunosuppression. These reactions are a complicated interaction involving a wide range of different cell types such as skin cells and cells of the immune system. The precise mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. An example of UV induced immunosuppression is the recurrent eruption of cold sores when the immune system can no longer keep the virus herpes simplex under control"}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation", "question": "I am dark-skinned – do I still need to be careful?", "answer": "Yes, you do. Compared to fair-skinned people, dark-skinned people have a much lower risk of developing melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancers, but there is still a risk. People with darker skin require more solar UV exposure to maintain adequate vitamin D levels, which may make them more susceptible to deficiency at high latitudes. But – regardless of skin colour - the risk of DNA damage, skin ageing, eye damage and harmful effects on the immune system remains and all protective measures are recommended."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "What are the most common oral diseases?", "answer": "The most common oral diseases are: dental caries (tooth decay) severe gum disease tooth loss and oral cancers. Untreated dental caries is the single most common condition globally, affecting an estimated 2.5 billion people. Severe gum disease – a major cause of total tooth loss – is estimated to affect 1 billion people worldwide. About 380 000 new cases of oral cancers are diagnosed every year."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "What are the key findings from the Global oral health status report?", "answer": "The report shows that almost half of the world’s population (45% or 3.5 billion people) suffer from oral diseases and that global cases of oral diseases have increased by 1 billion over the last 30 years – a clear indication that many people do not have access to prevention and treatment of oral diseases. The report underscores the glaring inequalities in access to oral health services, with a huge burden of oral diseases and conditions affecting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. People on low incomes, people living with disabilities, older people living alone or in care homes, those living in remote and rural communities and people from minority groups carry a higher burden of oral diseases. This pattern of inequalities is similar to other noncommunicable diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and mental disorders. Risk factors common to noncommunicable diseases such as high sugar intake, all forms of tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol all contribute to the global oral health crisis."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "What are the barriers to delivering oral health services?", "answer": "Only a small percentage of the global population is covered by essential oral health care services, and those with the greatest need often have the least access to services. The key barriers to delivering access to oral health services for all include the following. High out-of-pocket expenditures for oral health care often lead to catastrophic costs and significant financial burden for families and communities. The provision of oral health services largely relies on highly specialized providers using expensive high-tech equipment and materials, and these services are not well integrated with primary health care models. Poor information and surveillance systems, combined with low priority for public oral health research are major bottlenecks to developing more effective oral health interventions and policies."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "What are the opportunities to improve global oral health?", "answer": "Placing people at the heart of oral health services is critical if we are to achieve the vision of universal health coverage for all individuals and communities by 2030. The Global oral health status report acts as a starting point by providing baseline information to help countries monitor progress of implementation, while also providing timely and relevant feedback to decision-makers at the national level. There are many promising opportunities to improve the state of global oral health including: adopting a public health approach by addressing common risk factors through promoting a well-balanced diet low in sugars, stopping use of all forms of tobacco, reducing alcohol consumption and improving access to effective and affordable fluoride toothpaste; planning oral health services as part of national health agenda and improving integration of oral health services in primary health care as part of universal health coverage; redefining oral health workforce models to respond to population needs and expanding competencies of non-oral-health health care workers to expand oral health service coverage; and strengthening information systems by collecting and integrating oral health data into national health monitoring systems."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "What is WHO’s response to this issue?", "answer": "Oral health has long been neglected in global health, but many oral diseases can be prevented and treated with the cost-effective measures. WHO is committed to providing guidance and support to countries so that all people, wherever they live and whatever their income, have the knowledge and tools needed to look after their teeth and mouths, and to access services for prevention and care when they need them. WHO is planning the first ever global oral health meeting for December 2024, which is one of the key milestones as part WHO preparations for the Fourth High-level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs . The meeting will be an opportunity to formally unite national oral health focal points with national UHC focal points and work together, with the support of WHO, to define the path forward for integration of essential oral health care services as part of UHC. The World Health Assembly adopted the resolution on oral health (WHA74.5) in 2021 at the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly. The resolution recommends a shift from the traditional curative approach towards a preventive approach that includes promotion of oral health within families, schools and workplaces, and includes timely, comprehensive and inclusive care within the primary health care system. The resolution affirms that oral health should be firmly embedded within the NCD agenda and that oral health care interventions should be included in universal health coverage programmes. In response to the resolution on oral health, the Secretariat developed the Global strategy on oral health , adopted in May 2022 (decision WHA75(11)) with a vision of universal health coverage for oral health for all individuals and communities by 2030. The Global oral health action plan 2023‒2030 was subsequently developed and included in the report on NCDs noted by the Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly (decision WHA76(9)). This includes a monitoring framework for tracking progress, with measurable targets to be achieved by 2030. In addition, WHO released the Global oral health status report in November 2022, which provides the first ever comprehensive picture of oral disease burden with data profiles for 194 countries, giving unique insights into key areas and markers of oral health that are relevant for decision-makers. WHO is collaborating with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on a 3-year project on phasing down the use of dental amalgam under the Minamata Convention on Mercury . The project will be piloted in 3 countries – Senegal, Thailand and Uruguay – working jointly with the relevant WHO regional and country offices during implementation. The project seeks to strengthen national capacity to phase down the use of and demand for dental amalgam and manage mercury/hazardous wastes from dental use in a measurable, equitable and environmentally sustainable manner. WHO strongly advocates for close collaboration between ministries of health and ministries of environment to effectively phase down the use of dental amalgam and, in some cases when appropriate, even a phase out. This can be achieved by creating a national roadmap with a time-bound agenda including clear roles, deadlines, key stakeholders and sufficient resources that should be aligned to the WHO Global oral health action plan (2023–2030)."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "Who can provide oral health care?", "answer": "Globally, there are a range of health care professionals specifically trained to respond to oral health diseases and conditions. There is wide variation in the naming conventions of oral health care professionals and relevant competencies that define their scope. The oral health workforce includes dentists, oral health therapists, dental hygienists, dental nurses, dental assistant and dental technicians. However, essential dental medicines and preparations could be delivered by other health care professionals in primary health care such as nurses, midwives and community health workers. These are preventive and minimal intervention procedures that can easily be applied in general primary health care settings. The development of innovative workforce model that promote task-sharing and interprofessional collaboration is one of the strategic objectives of the WHO Global oral health action plan (2023–2030)."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "Is bad breath or crooked teeth a public health issue?", "answer": "No. Bad breath can be caused by a range of reasons and this symptom alone does not indicate an oral health issue of public health concern, although in individual cases it could be associated with an oral disease. Oral health is defined as the state of the mouth, teeth and orofacial structures that enables individuals to perform essential functions, such as eating, breathing and speaking, and encompasses psychosocial dimensions, such as self-confidence, well-being and the ability to socialize and work without pain, discomfort and embarrassment. Crooked teeth may indicate a need for more rigorous daily oral hygiene practices but in itself is not a public health issue."}
{"topic": "/oral-health", "question": "How often should someone see a dentist?", "answer": "There is no strong evidence to suggest a best practice for regular check-ups despite being a commonly cited approach to maintaining oral health. Dental check-ups are especially important during pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/semaglutide-injection-products", "question": "What is semaglutide?", "answer": "Semaglutide is a medicine that is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes. If you have this type of diabetes, your body struggles to control blood sugar levels. Semaglutide can help by lowering your blood sugar and reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Most semaglutide products must be injected under the skin on a weekly basis but it is also available as a tablet taken by mouth daily. In addition to treating type 2 diabetes, semaglutide has been shown to be effective in lowering body weight in obese or overweight adults with health problems related to their weight; many people who take it would lose weight as it reduces their appetite."}
{"topic": "/semaglutide-injection-products", "question": "What is the problem/issue?", "answer": "WHO has observed increased reports of falsified semaglutide products reported from all geographical regions to the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS). The possible harm related to such falsified semaglutide varies; in some cases, the active ingredient is absent, which can lead to health complications if being used to manage blood glucose levels, weight, or cardiovascular disease risk. In other cases, another undeclared active ingredient may be contained in the injection device, e.g. insulin, leading to an unpredictable range of health risks or complications."}
{"topic": "/semaglutide-injection-products", "question": "Why is this happening?", "answer": "Increased demand: Since late 2022, there has been increasing demand for semaglutide, especially since some specific brands were approved for weight loss in some countries. Press and social media coverage has contributed to its increased visibility and public awareness of its use for weight loss. Limited access: High demand for semaglutide as a weight loss product may limit access to this drug. Unmet demand is likely being fulfilled by the production of falsified semaglutide."}
{"topic": "/semaglutide-injection-products", "question": "What are the potential health risks of using falsified semaglutide?", "answer": "Ineffectiveness : Falsified semaglutide may contain insufficient or incorrect amounts of active ingredient. This can lead to ineffective treatment of type 2 diabetes, uncontrolled blood sugar levels, no weight loss, and no reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. Incorrect dosages : Falsified semaglutide may not contain the correct amount of ingredients , which can either lead to overdosing or underdosing. Incorrect dosing may lead to adverse effects such as severe gastrointestinal problems or symptoms of low blood sugar, including blurred vision, palpitation, dizziness , sweating, seizure, and loss of consciousness. These can be serious effects or even life-threatening. Unknown ingredients : The composition of falsified semaglutide is unknown; therefore, the safety and quality cannot be guaranteed. It may cause unpredictable side-effects or interactions with other medications, posing a significant risk to the user’s health. These may include allergic reactions, toxic reactions, or other serious health complications. Contamination: Falsified medicines may be produced in environments that are non-sterile, leading to impurities and contamination with bacteria, fungi, or other harmful microorganisms. This can cause infections, which could range from mild to severe to potentially even life-threatening."}
{"topic": "/semaglutide-injection-products", "question": "What can/should you do to avoid falsified products?", "answer": "Get a prescription from a licensed doctor. If your prescribed product is not available, consult your doctor about possible substitutes. Always buy the product from authorized/licensed pharmacies. Avoid buying from unfamiliar or unverified sources, such as those that may be found online and be wary of unusually low prices and injectable semaglutide stored outside the refrigerator. Check the packaging and the product for damage and ensure the necessary details like manufacturer’s information, batch number, and expiration date are present. Use the product as indicated by your doctor and the product leaflet. In case of doubt of the authenticity of the product, always verify with healthcare professionals and report to your regulatory authority. Monitor for side-effects after using the product and report any adverse reaction to a healthcare professional."}

{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Are NCDs really a health problem for my country?", "answer": "Absolutely! NCDs are a problem in some shape or form everywhere, although patterns of disease vary between countries and regions. You can see which NCDs and risk factors should be health priorities in your country in the WHO noncommunicable diseases data portal ."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Aren’t NCDs inevitable because we all have to die of something?", "answer": "Many NCDs are preventable – and too many people are becoming ill and dying too young and unnecessarily. The majority of the 17 million deaths from NCDs each year among people under age 70 could be prevented or significantly delayed."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "What drives NCDs?", "answer": "Five major risk factors linked to our everyday environment – tobacco use, unhealthy diet, the harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity and air pollution – drive responses in our bodies that also increase NCD risk: raised blood pressure, obesity, high blood sugar levels and raised cholesterol."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Do NCDs cost our country money?", "answer": "Yes – and the economic costs and benefits are often not fully understood, so it is important to build understanding of the extent of NCDs and the potential for action."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Won’t fixing this cost too much money in the short term for benefits that won’t be seen for years?", "answer": "Not addressing NCDs is already costing billions of dollars a year! The return on investment of a package of measures to address NCDs can be as high as 7:1 – that is fantastic value for money that can significantly reduce individual and national health care costs. Spending today can prevent the onset of disease and prevent complications – and it can also have benefits very quickly, for example for people with diabetes and hypertension."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Aren’t NCDs just down to individuals making poor choices?", "answer": "No! Behaviour is hugely affected by our surroundings: people can’t eat healthy food if unhealthy food is all that is available or affordable, or be more active if the local neighbourhood is unsafe, or not use alcohol or tobacco if these are being aggressively promoted, and they can’t chose to breathe clean air if they live in an area where the air is polluted. But we can all live longer, healthier lives if governments live up to their responsibility to create supportive environments that protect people from developing NCDs and provide treatment to manage these diseases and prevent complications for those living with NCDs."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Shouldn’t our focus be on investing in addressing COVID-19 and to prevent future pandemics?", "answer": "This is not an either–or! COVID-19 showed that people with existing health conditions (particularly NCDs) are more vulnerable to severe outcomes from many infectious diseases, and resilience against future pandemics depends on strong health systems, which includes NCD prevention and treatment."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "What can individuals living with NCDs do to improve the response to NCDs?", "answer": "Individuals and communities with first-hand experience in living with NCDs hold key insights and expertise that can unlock opportunities to overcome barriers to accessing and sustaining health care. The right to participate in one’s care is also a fundamental part of the human right to the highest attainable standard of health."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Why should my country invest in NCDs when we have so many other urgent issues to deal with, such as conflict, a humanitarian crisis or climate change?", "answer": "Everyone has the right to the best available standard of health, even during crises! Every effort must be made to ensure that as many people as possible who are living with NCDs can continue to access appropriate prevention, treatment and medication, whether this is an immediate matter of life-and-death (such as access to insulin for people with type 1 diabetes) or longer term (such as blood pressure medication). Efforts to address climate change and air pollution – such as ensuring a healthy, sustainable food supply, implement sustainable transport policies or design cities with neighbourhoods that are walkable and cyclable – can also help to address NCDs."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Aren’t NCDs only really a big problem for men?", "answer": "No! Women and girls often face a triple challenge of reproductive and maternal conditions, infectious disease and NCDs."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "As a donor, can development assistance really make a difference?", "answer": "Yes! This isn’t about financing a whole health system – your assistance can find ways to unlock domestic funding or be used in targeted, effective ways, with long-lasting, far-reaching impacts."}
{"topic": "/ncds", "question": "Will addressing NCDs have benefits beyond health?", "answer": "Yes! NCDs are central to sustainable economic development, but this is often not fully appreciated. Good NCD prevention, treatment and care can have significant co-benefits, with improvements in education, equality and the environment, with reducing poverty, and in boosting economic growth."}

Contact WHO via email if you have further questions: disability@who.int."}
{"topic": "/model-disability-survey", "question": "What is the Model Disability Survey?", "answer": "The Model Disability Survey (MDS) is a survey tool that provides comprehensive information about the levels of disability in a population. It also identifies unmet needs and the barriers and inequalities faced by people who experience different levels of disability. The MDS was developed by the World Health Organization and the World Bank."}
{"topic": "/model-disability-survey", "question": "What is the Model Disability Survey used for?", "answer": "The MDS has been designed to help countries better understand the situation of people with disability, including whether they have mild, moderate or severe disability, and what needs to be done to ensure they can fully enjoy their human rights on an equal basis with others. The MDS will also support countries to implement and report on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Sustainable Development Goals."}
{"topic": "/model-disability-survey", "question": "What definition of disability is used in the Model Disability Survey?", "answer": "How is disability conceptualized in the MDS? Distribution of disability in the population The MDS is based on the understanding of disability in the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The ICF sees disability as something that a person with a health condition or impairment experiences depending on the barriers he or she faces in daily life. This would include, for example, how they are treated by other people or whether they are able to access buildings, transportation and information. The ICF also helps ensure that disability is seen as something dynamic, based on an individual’s situation, which can change if and when the environment becomes more enabling. In the ICF, how much disability a person experiences in daily life can be very different: on a continuum it ranges from people who do not experience disability at all to people who have very severe levels of disability. Because the environment plays an important role in a person’s experience of disability, it is not appropriate to assume that certain health conditions or impairments cause more disability than others. For example, it is not appropriate to assume that people with mobility impairments experience higher levels of disability than people with hearing impairments. Nor is it appropriate to assume that two people with the exact same impairment (such as low vision) or health condition (such as Parkinson’s disease) will experience the same barriers and consequently the same level of disability. It all depends on where people live, how they are treated, what supports they have, and what level of health or social services they have access to, for example."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "What is TB screening?", "answer": "TB screening involves the active identification of people at risk for TB disease. Populations or high-risk groups are screened by assessing symptoms and by using tests, examinations or other procedures that can be applied rapidly. TB screening is sometimes also referred to as “active TB case finding”."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "Why is systematic screening for TB disease necessary?", "answer": "WHO recommends that screening is carried out systematically in people who are at the highest risk of getting TB, as early detection and start of treatment can improve their outcomes and prevent them from sustaining catastrophic costs. People may not fully appreciate their risk of TB and treatment programmes that rely completely on people presenting for TB care when they feel sick will miss many opportunities to treat people earlier in their disease. In this way screening can help promote health, and help people bypass many of the barriers that they face in accessing health care. Screening can benefit the entire community by reducing the prevalence of TB and averting future disease. Scaling up systematic screening for TB is important for communities with a high burden of TB, and for countries where a large proportion of TB patients remains undetected or present late for care."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "Who could benefit from TB screening?", "answer": "WHO strongly recommends screening the following populations for TB: household and close contacts of TB patients (either at home or in their communities), people living with HIV, people exposed to silica (usually through some forms of mining) and people in prisons. Other groups that may be considered for screening include: people with risk factors for TB in a healthcare setting (for example, those with diabetes, chronic lung disease, malnourishment, older age groups), communities at higher risk of TB or with limited access to care."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "Is community-wide screening recommended?", "answer": "Community-wide screening may be conducted among target populations at higher risk for TB and with limited access to health care, such as urban poor communities, homeless communities, migrants, refugees, remote isolated communities, and other vulnerable or marginalized groups. Community-wide screening may also be conducted in areas where the prevalence of TB in the general population is 0.5% or higher. Studies show that in these conditions TB screening can reduce the prevalence and spread of TB in the population, if it is conducted with adequate coverage using rigorous tools for screening and diagnosis."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "Where can I get screened for TB?", "answer": "TB screening is often done during contact investigations in households and community settings, or in clinics, such as HIV clinics, primary health care centres or outpatient departments. Occupational screening might be done in the workplace and screening can also take place in penitentiary or other institutions. Communities at risk can be reached through mobile outreach screening campaigns."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "What screening options are available?", "answer": "There are a number of ways to screen for TB and decide to do further testing. These consist of symptom screens, chest radiography (chest X-ray or CXR), and molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests (mWRDs) such as Xpert MTB/RIF® and Truenat® on sputum. C-reactive protein, a simple point-of-care blood test, can also be used to screen for TB among people living with HIV. Multiple screening tests may be performed, either in parallel or one after the other. Tests for TB infection - skin test (using tuberculin (TST) or new TB antigens (TBST)) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRAs) - are not used for the screening of TB disease."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "How are tests used for screening?", "answer": "Screening aims to identify people who have a higher likelihood of having TB and who need further testing. Screening tests are done as part of algorithms so that people who screen positive receive further diagnostic tests. There are different screening algorithms which depend on the populations being tested (e.g. general population, people living with HIV, people with other risk factors for TB, children) as well as the availability of the tests. The operational handbook that accompanies the guidelines describes several algorithms that reflect the most recent evidence on the performance of these tests and screening algorithms."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "Can I choose the screening option that suits me?", "answer": "Different screening tests and algorithms may apply to people with different characteristics (e.g. age, HIV infection, prevalence of TB in the community). Your healthcare provider can give you more information about which screening tests are best suited for you."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "Is it true that artificial intelligence is better than people at reading X-rays?", "answer": "Computer-aided detection (CAD) software can be used to interpret chest radiography instead of trained people like radiologists. CAD software products, which incorporate artificial intelligence in their functioning, have been shown to identify TB abnormalities as well as trained healthcare workers. However, for the time being, radiologists and other trained specialists are still needed to distinguish different diseases on CXR or interpret CXR for TB in children. The 2021 WHO recommendation on CAD relates only to its use to determine the likelihood that an X-ray abnormality is due to pulmonary TB or not. Nonetheless the field of CAD is rapidly evolving, and it is possible that these technologies will become proficient for other uses in medicine in future."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "What happens if my screening test is “positive”?", "answer": "This is not a confirmation that you are sick with TB. It usually means that further testing may be required to check if you have TB disease. These confirmatory tests may involve the collection of sputum, urine, blood, X-ray or other types of investigations. Sometimes these tests may be done in the same place where you were screened but at times they are done in other centres. Your healthcare provider can give you more information about this."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "How do I know if I have TB disease?", "answer": "TB disease typically causes cough, sputum (sometimes with blood), fever, night sweats and loss of appetite. If you develop any of these, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately. Some of these symptoms may be due to conditions other than TB, like colds or pneumonia."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "What happens if my screening test is “negative”?", "answer": "This usually means that no further testing is required and there is no evidence that you have disease caused by TB. Sometimes a second screening test will be carried out to confirm the negative result of the first screening test. However, you may still be at a higher risk of developing TB and therefore a discussion with your healthcare provider on testing for TB infection and any need for TB preventive treatment (TPT) will be useful. If symptoms suggestive of TB develop, please consult with your healthcare provider."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "What is tuberculosis preventive treatment or TPT?", "answer": "Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) consists of a course of one or more anti-tuberculosis medicines given with the intent of preventing the development of TB disease. TPT is only given to people who are infected with TB bacteria, or who have been exposed to it, and who are at a higher risk of developing TB disease. TPT is effective in eliminating TB bacilli that have infected the body before they can damage the organs and cause illness. It is estimated that about one fourth of the world’s population has been infected with TB bacteria and most of them will not have disease. However, some of these individuals have a higher risk of developing TB disease and effective TPT can reduce that risk substantially."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "How often should screening be repeated?", "answer": "Some people who are at particularly high risk of developing TB disease or who have continued exposure to infectious TB may require repeated screening, such as people with an abnormal CXR (e.g. fibrotic lesion) that is compatible with TB but who were not diagnosed with TB disease at the time of screening, health-care workers, prisoners and people living with HIV. People living with HIV should be screened for symptoms of TB or using other screening tools at every encounter with a health worker, such as annual X-ray screening for people living with HIV who are in regular HIV care, at the time of viral load testing or other investigations. Annual or semi-annual workplace screenings can be a practical option for occupations with higher risk of TB, such as miners with silica exposure and healthcare workers. In penitentiary institutions it is suggested that, at minimum, screening be conducted at entry, annually thereafter and before release. For community-wide screening, reduction in the prevalence and transmission of TB has been shown from repeated screenings conducted annually over multiple years. Once the prevalence of TB in a community or risk group is substantially reduced, a TB programme may decide to stop screening but the criteria for doing so should be established in advance."}
{"topic": "/systematic-screening-for-tb", "question": "What is the cost of screening? Who will pay for screening?", "answer": "Early and complete detection and treatment of people with TB also prevents transmission and could lead to a reduced prevalence, and by doing so it can ultimately save costs. However, implementing screening requires extra resources, both human and financial. There will also be additional costs due to increased demand for diagnostic testing of people who screen positive for TB, and for treating the extra people with TB who may be identified by screening. Resource mobilization from domestic and/or external sources may thus be needed. Funding agencies such as the Global Fund  can support screening activities. Early and complete detection and treatment of people with TB also prevents transmission and could lead to a reduced prevalence, and by doing so it can ultimately save costs. People who are undergoing screening should not pay out-of-pocket expenses for screening tests or any resulting diagnosis or treatment of TB, nor should they suffer financial hardship as a result of screening."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "What is XDR-TB?", "answer": "XDR-TB, an abbreviation for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), is a form of TB that is caused by a strain of M. tuberculosis complex that is resistant to rifampicin (and may also be resistant to isoniazid), and that is also resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and to at least one other Group A drug (bedaquiline or linezolid). While there are some shorter regimens available for multidrug-resistant TB, treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is typically longer and often associated with a higher likelihood of toxicity. This increased risk stems from factors such as prolonged drug exposure, higher intolerance, adverse effects and a greater potential for drug-drug interactions, particularly in critically ill patients. Furthermore, some of the existing shorter regimens effective for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are not applicable for XDR-TB patients."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How do people get XDR-TB?", "answer": "People may get XDR-TB in one of two ways. It may develop in a patient who is receiving treatment for active TB, when anti-TB drugs are misused or mismanaged, and is usually a sign of inadequate clinical care or drug management. It can happen when patients are not properly supported to complete their entire course of treatment, when the supply of drugs to the clinics dispensing drugs is erratic, or when the drugs are of poor quality. The second way that people can develop XDR-TB is by becoming infected by a patient who is already ill with the condition. Patients with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing or simply talking. To become infected, a person needs only to breathe in a small number of these germs. However, only a small proportion of people infected with TB germs develop the disease."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How easily is XDR-TB spread?", "answer": "Studies suggest that there is probably no difference between the risk of transmission of XDR-TB and any other forms of TB. The spread of TB bacteria depends on factors such as the number and concentration of infectious people in any one place together, and the presence of people with a higher risk of being infected (such as those with HIV). The likelihood of becoming infected increases with the time that a previously uninfected person spends in the same room as an infectious person. The risk of spread increases where there is a high concentration of TB bacteria, such as in poorly ventilated environments like overcrowded houses, hospitals or prisons. The risk of spread is reduced if infectious patients receive timely and proper treatment."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How can a person avoid becoming infected with XDR-TB?", "answer": "While patients with XDR-TB may be as infectious as those with drug-susceptible TB, the chances of an XDR-TB infection are lower due to the rarity of the condition. The measures to be taken are the same as those for the prevention of DS-TB. Close contact with infectious TB patients must be avoided, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. The risk of becoming infected with TB is very low outdoors in the open air. TB patients should be encouraged to follow good cough hygiene, for example by covering their mouths with a handkerchief when they cough, or even using a surgical mask in the early stages of treatment, especially in closed environments with poor ventilation."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How can a person who already has drug-susceptible TB avoid getting XDR-TB?", "answer": "The most important thing is for the health care workers and the community to provide all the means (information, counselling and material support) that enable patients to continue taking all their treatment as prescribed. No doses should be missed, and above all, treatment should be taken right through to the end. If a patient experiences adverse effects of the treatment – for example, the tablets make them feel sick – then they should inform their doctor or nurse because often there is a simple solution. If they need to go away for any reason, patients should ensure they have enough tablets with them for the duration of the trip."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "Can XDR-TB be cured or treated?", "answer": "XDR-TB patients can be cured, but with the current drugs available, the likelihood of success is much smaller than in patients with DS-TB or even MDR/RR-TB. Cure depends on the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease, and whether the patient’s immune system is compromised. Patients infected with HIV may have a higher mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis are important to provide effective treatment as soon as possible."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How do countries prevent XDR-TB?", "answer": "National TB control programmes working with all health services can prevent XDR-TB by ensuring that all practitioners involved in TB care follow the latest WHO policy recommendations on drug-resistant TB treatment. These emphasize providing proper diagnosis and treatment to all TB patients, including those with drug-resistant TB; assuring regular, timely supplies of all anti-TB drugs; proper management of anti-TB drugs and providing support to patients to maximize adherence to prescribed regimens; caring for MDR- or XDR-TB cases in services with proper ventilation, and minimizing contact with other patients, particularly those with HIV, especially in the early stages before treatment has had a chance to reduce the infectiousness."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "Can the TB vaccine, known as BCG, prevent XDR-TB?", "answer": "The BCG vaccine prevents severe forms of TB in children, such as TB meningitis, but is less effective in preventing pulmonary TB in adults, the commonest and most infectious form of TB. BCG's effectiveness against XDR-TB is expected to be similar to that of ordinary TB. Nevertheless, new vaccines are urgently needed, and WHO is actively advocating for the development of new vaccines."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "What is the link between XDR-TB and HIV/AIDS? Why in some places is XDR-TB linked with HIV?", "answer": "People living with HIV are at greater risk of developing TB – as well as XDR-TB - than people without HIV, because of their weakened immunity. In few places where XDR-TB strains circulate more frequently, people with HIV are therefore more likely to be infected with XDR-TB than elsewhere. To date, in most of the places with high rates of HIV infection, XDR-TB has not been widespread. For this reason, the majority of people with HIV who develop TB will have ordinary TB and can be treated with standard first-line anti-TB drugs. For those with HIV infection, treatment with antiretroviral drugs will likely reduce the risk of developing XDR-TB, just as it does with ordinary TB. Patients with both XDR-TB and HIV who do not receive antiretroviral drugs are at high risk of dying."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How can I tell if I might have TB or XDR-TB?", "answer": "XDR-TB can only be diagnosed in a well-equipped laboratory. Symptoms of XDR-TB are no different from ordinary TB: a cough with thick, cloudy mucus (or sputum), sometimes with blood, for more than two weeks; fever, chills and night sweats; fatigue and muscle weakness; weight loss; and in some cases shortness of breath and chest pain. If you have these symptoms, it does not mean you have XDR-TB. But it does mean you must go and see a doctor for a check-up. If you are already on treatment for TB, and at least some of these symptoms are not improving after a few weeks of medication, you should inform your clinician or nurse."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "How quickly can XDR-TB be diagnosed?", "answer": "If TB bacteria are found in the sputum, TB can be diagnosed in a day or two. However, it may take 6 to 16 weeks to confirm XDR-TB."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "Is it safe to travel to places where XDR-TB has been identified?", "answer": "XDR-TB is still very rare but has been documented in many countries. People who are most at risk if they do come into contact with someone with XDR-TB are those with reduced immunity to infectious diseases, such as those with HIV infection or other medical conditions that can weaken a person's immunity. It is also advised that such people avoid areas where infection control measures are not in place. Air travel carries only very minimal risks of infection with any kind of TB. Concerned travelers should seek advice before their visit from their doctor, national authorities, or trusted travel websites such as WHO’s travel and health page ."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "What should be done if a person has been in contact with a known or presumptive case of XDR-TB?", "answer": "Anyone who has been in contact with someone known, or presumptive of having, XDR-TB should consult their doctor or a local TB clinic and be screened to see if they have TB. This is most important if the person has any symptoms of TB. If they have a cough, they will be asked to provide a sample of sputum, which will be tested for evidence of TB disease. If TB is confirmed, treatment should start according to the drug-susceptibility test profile results If there is any evidence of infection with TB bacteria but without TB disease, preventive treatment may be given or the person may simply be asked to attend health services periodically for a check up."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "Should patients with XDR-TB be isolated while on treatment or after treatment options have failed?", "answer": "Patients with presumptive TB or XDR-TB are occasionally hospitalized to confirm the diagnosis. Following the commencement of appropriate treatment, isolation is usually unnecessary. Isolation has a very limited role in patients in whom treatment has failed. Studies have shown that treating TB patients at home with appropriate infection measures generally poses no substantial risk to other members of the household. By the time a diagnosis is made, the household contacts have already been exposed to the patient’s infection. However, in the absence of curative treatment options, all infection control measures at the household should be strengthened. Whenever this is not feasible, the patient should be offered options for voluntary isolation and delivery of palliative and end-of-life care."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "What risks do healthcare workers face with XDR-TB, particularly those who may be HIV-positive themselves?", "answer": "To protect healthcare workers who may come into contact with infectious TB patients, appropriate and strict infection control measures must be implemented in healthcare facilities at all times. Health-care workers are also encouraged to make sure that they are aware of their HIV status so that they can restrict putting themselves at risk of exposure."}
{"topic": "/tuberculosis-extensively-drug-resistant-tuberculosis-(XDR-TB)", "question": "What is WHO doing to combat XDR-TB?", "answer": "First, WHO ensures that the health authorities responsible for TB care and support receive the most up-to-date information about XDR-TB. The latest updates on XDR-TB, along with other relevant TB matters, are regularly published on the WHO Global TB Programme website. Second, WHO advises that good TB prevention, care and support prevent the emergence of drug resistance in the first place and that the proper treatment of MDR/RR-TB prevents the emergence of XDR-TB. Third, WHO is regularly updating its guidance to ministries of health on the treatment and diagnostic policies for drug-resistant TB patients."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "Are people with tuberculosis likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, illness and death?", "answer": "COVID-19 patients who develop tuberculosis (TB) have a higher risk of mortality. People with TB who develop COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes if TB treatment is interrupted. Older age, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with more severe COVID-19 and are also risk factors for poor outcomes in TB. In people with these pre-existing conditions special precautions are advised by health authorities to protect from COVID-19 and TB. Both COVID-19 and TB attack primarily the lungs. People ill with COVID-19 and TB may show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing. The incubation period from exposure to disease in TB is longer, often with a slow onset."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "Do COVID-19 and tuberculosis spread in the same way?", "answer": "While both COVID-19 and TB spread by close contact between people, the exact mode of transmission differs, which explains some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions. TB bacteria remain suspended in particles in the air for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts or sings, and people who inhale these particles can get infected. The infection happens in the lung. COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of particles expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may contaminate objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Handwashing, in addition to respiratory precautions, are thus important in the control of COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "What has been the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on essential tuberculosis services?", "answer": "The COVID-19 pandemic had a damaging impact on access to TB diagnosis and treatment and the burden of TB disease. Progress made in the years up to 2019 was slowed, stalled or reversed, and global TB targets are off track. The most obvious and immediate impact was a large global drop in the reported number of people newly diagnosed with TB. From a peak of 7.1 million in 2019, this fell to 5.8 million in 2020 (-18%), back to the level last seen in 2012. Reductions in the reported number of people diagnosed with TB in 2020 and 2021 suggest that the number of people with undiagnosed and untreated TB has grown, resulting first in an increased number of TB deaths and more community transmission of infection. Globally, the estimated number of deaths from TB increased from 1.4 million in 2019 to 1.6 million in 2021, reversing years of decline between 2005 and 2019. All measures should be taken to ensure continuity of services for people who need preventive and curative treatment for tuberculosis (TB)."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "What should health authorities do to provide sustainability of essential tuberculosis services during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "People-centred delivery of TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services should be ensured in tandem with COVID-19 care. Outpatient and community-based care should be strongly preferred over hospital treatment for TB patients (unless serious conditions require hospitalization) to reduce opportunities for transmission. Prevention: Measures must be implemented to limit transmission of TB and COVID-19 in congregate settings and health care facilities. Administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). Provision of TB preventive treatment should be maintained and expanded. Diagnosis: Tests for TB and COVID-9 are different and both should be made available for individuals with respiratory symptoms, which may be similar for the two diseases. Treatment and care: TB treatment, in line with the latest WHO guidelines, must be provided for all TB patients, including those in quarantine and those with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Adequate stocks of TB medicines should be provided to all patients to reduce trips to collect medicines. Use of digital health technologies for patients and programmes should be intensified. In line with WHO recommendations, technologies like electronic medication monitors and video-supported therapy can help patients complete their TB treatment."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "How can health authorities ensure supplies of tuberculosis medicines and diagnostics?", "answer": "Appropriate planning and monitoring are essential to ensure that procurement and supply of TB medicines and diagnostics are not interrupted. WHO monitors medicine supply at the global level, while the Global Fund, the Stop TB Partnership Global Drug Facility (GDF), USAID, Unitaid and other donors play an essential role in supporting countries to secure adequate and sustainable supplies of TB medicines, drugs and diagnostics."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "What services can be leveraged across both diseases?", "answer": "The response to COVID-19 can benefit from the capacity building efforts developed for TB over many years of investment by national authorities and donors. These include infection prevention and control, contact tracing, household and community-based care, and surveillance and monitoring systems. Although modes of transmission of the two diseases are slightly different, administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). TB laboratory networks have been established in countries with the support of WHO and international partners. These networks as well as specimen transportation mechanisms could also be used for COVID-19 diagnosis and surveillance. Respiratory physicians, pulmonology staff of all grades, TB specialists and health workers at the primary health care level may be points of reference for patients with pulmonary complications of COVID-19. They should familiarize themselves with the most current WHO recommendations for the supportive treatment and containment of COVID-19. Various digital technologies used in TB programmes can support the COVID-19 response, including adherence support, electronic medical records and eLearning."}

Lessons learnt over many years of TB infection prevention and control, contact tracing, investigation and management can benefit efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tuberculosis", "question": "Is tuberculosis treatment different in people who have both TB and COVID-19?", "answer": "In most cases TB treatment is not different in people with or without COVID-19 infection. TB preventive treatment, treatment for drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB disease should continue uninterrupted to safeguard the patient’s health, reduce transmission and prevent the development of drug-resistance. Effective treatments to prevent TB and to treat active TB have been scaled up and are in use worldwide. The risk of death in TB patients approaches 50% if left untreated and may be higher in the elderly or in the presence of comorbidity. Read more on the clinical management of COVID-19"}

{"topic": "/tuberculosis-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-(mdr-tb)", "question": "What is multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) and how do we treat it?", "answer": "MDR/RR-TB definition usually refers to either multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB). Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is a form of TB disease caused by a strain of M. tuberculosis complex that is resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid. Globally, an estimated 410 000 people (95% UI: 370 000–450 000) developed multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) in 2022. The treatment success rate for people diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB has steadily improved, but it remains alarmingly low. Globally, in 2020, the treatment success rate was 63%, up from 60% in 2019 and 50% in 2012. The two reasons why MDR/RR-TB continues to emerge and spread are mismanagement of TB treatment and person-to-person transmission. Most people with TB are cured by a 6-month treatment regimen that is provided to patients with adequate support. Inappropriate or incorrect use of TB drugs, use of ineffective formulations of drugs (such as the use of single drugs, poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions), and premature treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and hospitals. Patients with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing or simply talking. To become infected, a person needs only to breathe in a small number of these germs. Based on current WHO policy, several regimens can be used in patients with MDR/RR-TB. The key factors that define treatment regimen choice include the patient's drug-resistance profile, prior exposure to TB medicines and patient history, the drug-resistance profile of close contacts, the patient’s age, the extent of pulmonary TB disease, and the localization of extrapulmonary TB lesions. BPaLM regimen (6 Bdq-Pa-Lzd-Mfx) : in      patients with MDR/RR-TB with or without additional resistance to      fluoroquinolones. This 6-month all-oral treatment regimen comprises      bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin. It is possible to      omit moxifloxacin and start or continue with the BPaL regimen for      MDR/RR-TB patients with confirmed fluoroquinolone resistance. 9-month all-oral regimen (4–6 Bdq (6 m) -Lfx/Mfx-Cfz-Z-E-Hh-Eto or Lzd (2 m) / 5 Lfx/Mfx- Cfz-Z-E) : in      patients with MDR/RR-TB and in whom resistance to fluoroquinolones has      been excluded. The 9-month all-oral regimen comprises bedaquiline (used      for six months), in combination with levofloxacin/moxifloxacin,      ethionamide, ethambutol, isoniazid (high dose), pyrazinamide and      clofazimine (for four months, with the possibility of extending to 6      months if the patient remains sputum smear positive at the end of 4      months); followed by treatment with levofloxacin/moxifloxacin,      clofazimine, ethambutol and pyrazinamide (for five months). Ethionamide      can be replaced by two months of linezolid. Longer individualized regimens : for      patients with MDR/RR-TB who are not eligible for, or had no favorable      treatment outcome using, the above 6-month or 9-month regimens, have TB      disease caused by M. tuberculosis strains with extensive drug resistance      (e.g. extensively drug-resistant TB [XDR-TB]) or have intolerance to key      components of the above-mentioned regimens. These regimens have a duration      of at least 18 months and are individually designed based on a      hierarchical grouping of second-line TB medicines, the drug-resistance      profile and the patient’s medical history. Based on the review of the latest available evidence, the 6-month BPaLM regimen is the preferred option for most patients with MDR/RR-TB."}
{"topic": "/influenza-h5n1", "question": "What is A(H5N1)?", "answer": "H5N1 is one of several influenza viruses that causes a highly infectious respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or \"bird flu\"). Infections in mammals, including humans, have also been documented. H5N1 influenza virus infection can cause a range of diseases in humans, from mild to severe and in some cases, it can even be fatal. Symptoms reported have primarily been respiratory, but conjunctivitis and other non-respiratory symptoms have also been reported. There have also been a few detections of A(H5N1) virus in persons who were exposed to infected animals or their environments but who did not show any symptoms. The goose/Guangdong-lineage of H5N1 avian influenza viruses first emerged in 1996 and has been causing outbreaks in birds since then. Since 2020, a variant of these viruses has led to an unprecedented number of deaths in wild birds and poultry in many countries. First affecting Africa, Asia and Europe, in 2021, the virus spread to North America, and in 2022, to Central and South America. From 2021 to 2022, Europe and North America observed their largest and most extended epidemic of avian influenza with unusual persistence of the virus in wild bird populations. Since 2022, there have been increasing reports of deadly outbreaks among mammals also caused by influenza A(H5) – including influenza A(H5N1) – viruses. There are likely to be more outbreaks that have not been detected or reported. Both land and sea mammals have been affected, including outbreaks in farmed fur animals, seals, sea lions, and detections in other wild and domestic animals such as foxes, bears, otters, raccoons, cats, dogs, cows, goats and others."}
{"topic": "/influenza-h5n1", "question": "How does the H5N1 virus spread to people?", "answer": "Almost all cases of H5N1 virus infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments, for example live bird markets. There have been some instances of spread from infected mammals to humans as well. While there may have been some cases that were not detected, the virus does not seem to easily infect humans or spread from person to person, based on the current knowledge and understanding."}
{"topic": "/influenza-h5n1", "question": "Why is there concern about influenza H5N1 virus?", "answer": "The H5N1 virus remains as an animal virus that primarily infects animals. So far, close to 900 human infections have been reported since 2003, of which more than half were fatal. The H5N1 virus is constantly evolving and could potentially become easily transmissible from person to person. If this occurs, it could be the start of a new influenza pandemic, as was the case with the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics."}
{"topic": "/influenza-h5n1", "question": "What are the symptoms of H5N1 infection in humans?", "answer": "The symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever (often high fever, > 38°C) and malaise, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Other early symptoms may include conjunctivitis and other non-respiratory symptoms. The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurologic changes (altered mental status or seizures). H5N1 virus has also been detected in samples collected from people without symptoms who had exposure to infected animals or their environments."}

{"topic": "/influenza-h5n1", "question": "What does WHO do to respond to H5N1 influenza?", "answer": "WHO works with countries to help them prevent, detect and manage cases of H5N1 virus infection in humans when they occur. WHO collaborates with global health partners and agencies, including the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to monitor the risk, and control and prevent the spread of animal diseases. WHO’s global laboratory system, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), identifies and monitors strains of circulating influenza viruses, and provides advice to countries on their risk to human health and available treatment or control measures. WHO works with partners around the world on pandemic preparedness for H5N1 and other animal influenzas."}
{"topic": "/influenza-avian", "question": "What is avian influenza?", "answer": "Avian influenza, sometimes known as bird flu, is a disease caused by a virus that mainly affects birds but can also affect mammals, including humans. It primarily spreads from infected birds to humans through close contact with birds or contaminated environments, such as in backyard poultry farm settings and at markets where birds are sold. There have also been limited reports of transmission from other infected animals to humans. Symptoms in humans range from mild to severe, and in some cases, can be fatal. Respiratory symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and sore throat are more common but non-respiratory symptoms such as fatigue and muscle or body aches are also reported. Asymptomatic infection has also been found in humans with exposure to infected animals or their environments."}
{"topic": "/influenza-avian", "question": "Who is at risk of avian influenza?", "answer": "People who come in contact with infected poultry (live or dead) or contaminated environments, such as farms or live bird markets, are at risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses. Slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household or backyard settings, are also risk factors. Mammals can also be infected with avian influenza viruses. There are increasing global reports of avian influenza in both wild and domestic animals such as minks, foxes, cats and most recently, dairy cows in the United States of America. Spread from mammals to humans has also been documented. While human infection with avian influenza viruses has been limited and sporadic so far, individuals who live in or visit regions where outbreaks are occurring in birds or other animals should take precautions and monitor their health. Seek care from your local health professional if you have flu-like symptoms."}
{"topic": "/influenza-avian", "question": "How can people protect themselves from avian influenza infections?", "answer": "In areas with avian influenza outbreaks in animals, avoid: contact with sick or dead animals contact with animals in farms and animal markets entering areas where animals may be slaughtered contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces slaughtering or eating sick animals. Follow good food safety practices such as avoiding the consumption of raw milk, eggs and meat; and hand hygiene, including regular handwashing with soap and water."}
{"topic": "/influenza-avian", "question": "What should you do if you think you may have avian influenza?", "answer": "Seek medical care immediately if you live in or have recently visited an area experiencing an outbreak of avian influenza (also called bird flu) in domestic poultry, wild birds or other animals and you are suffering flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing, or conjunctivitis or other unexplained symptoms. Inform your healthcare provider of any exposure to sick or dead animals. In addition, take protective measures: wear a mask      and limit contact with others; practice respiratory hygiene –      covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, disposing of tissues      correctly; improve ventilation when indoors; avoid touching your eyes, nose or      mouth; and wash your hands with soap and      water regularly."}

Among the 28 human cases that have been reported to WHO since 2021, no human-to-human transmission has been reported."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "What is self-care?", "answer": "WHO defines self-care as the ability of individuals, families\r\nand communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to\r\ncope with illness – with or without the support of a health or care worker."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "What are self-care interventions and actions?", "answer": "Self-care interventions can include medicines, devices, diagnostics and digital tools.  Self-care actions include practices, habits and lifestyle choices."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "What does WHO recommend for self-care interventions?", "answer": "The WHO living guideline on self-care interventions for health and well-being includes recommendations on safe and effective interventions that should be used within a supportive enabling environment. The current recommendations cover interventions for sexual and reproductive health and rights, including self-care options for improving antenatal, delivery, postpartum and newborn care; providing high-quality services for family planning, including infertility services; eliminating unsafe abortion; combating sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, reproductive tract infections, and cervical cancer; promoting sexual health; and non-communicable diseases, including mental health, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Examples of self-care interventions include self-administered injectable contraception, self-collection of vaginal samples for HPV screening, self-monitoring of blood glucose for diabetes, including gestational diabetes; self-monitoring of blood pressure for heart disease and managing pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, and self-tests for a range of issues such as HIV, pregnancy and COVID-19. Further interventions will be regularly added to the global guideline as the evidence-base expands."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "What are the elements of an enabling environment for self-care interventions?", "answer": "WHO’s conceptual framework on self-care interventions has core\r\nelements from both people-centred and health systems approaches, underpinned by\r\nthe key principles of human rights, ethics, inclusivity and gender equality.\r\nThe enabling environment includes elements, beyond health services themselves,\r\nthat require attention to ensure that self-care interventions can be\r\nappropriately implemented. These include the education, justice and social\r\nservices sectors, because self-care interventions are mostly accessed and/or\r\nused outside formal health services. For example, it is important for people to\r\nhave enough education and sufficient health and sometimes digital literacy to\r\nunderstand information about self-care interventions and make informed choices\r\nabout their use."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "Do I need to see a health or care worker to engage in self-care activities?", "answer": "Self-care interventions provide individuals, families and\r\ncommunities with a way to manage their own health. They are intended as a\r\ncomplement to facility-based care and may require support from the health\r\nsystem in some instances. Some self-care actions, such as washing your hands,\r\nwearing masks and practicing good respiratory hygiene measures that protect you\r\nfrom COVID-19 do not need you to meet with a health or care worker. Other\r\nself-care interventions, such as obtaining a prescription for hormonal\r\ncontraception or counselling during pregnancy, may need interaction with a\r\nhealth or care worker. Such support can be provided in different ways and will\r\ndepend on the healthcare arrangements in place where you live; for example,\r\nsome medicines are available over the counter without a prescription in a\r\npharmacy, or counselling and important information during pregnancy and when\r\ncaring for a newborn can be provided over the phone or online."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "Are self-care interventions safe?", "answer": "All WHO recommendations on self-care interventions are based on\r\nthe best available evidence to date, including evidence of their safety and\r\neffectiveness when provided alongside support from the formal health system if\r\nneeded. WHO does not recommend use of unregulated and substandard products. Incorrect\r\nor unclear health information or lack of access to health and care workers\r\nand/or health facilities, should they be needed, are potential challenges that need\r\nto be addressed when using self-care interventions."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "Why are self-care interventions important during health emergencies?", "answer": "In crisis settings, securing necessities such as food and shelter is the primary need. In addition, meeting people’s health needs by providing the right care at the right time can prevent or mitigate adverse health consequences. In situations where healthcare resources are scarce, self-care interventions can provide opportunities to access the appropriate care at the right time and complement limited access to facility based care. Evidence-based, high-quality self-care interventions can provide an important means of maintaining health when national health systems are disrupted and health facility or health and care worker-based services become unavailable or restricted in fragile or humanitarian settings. In fragile and humanitarian settings, seeking and creating innovative approaches that increase efficiencies in provision, management, quality control and service integration could drive self-care interventions to becoming sustainable, accessible and effective healthcare options."}
{"topic": "/self-care-for-health-and-well-being", "question": "Do self-care interventions shift the burden of care to vulnerable people?", "answer": "People may use self-care interventions for several reasons, including convenience, confidentiality, cost, empowerment, a better fit with lifestyle, or because they lack access to quality health services or anticipate facing stigma and discrimination. The self-care interventions and practices that WHO recommends are not intended to add to the daily workload and financial burden of individuals and communities, including those who may already be marginalized and underserved. For many self-care interventions to be effective, links to care and complementary support from the health system are essential. When integrated into health systems, self-care interventions may save money for users (including transport costs and loss of income when seeking facility based care) and health and care providers (under circumstances where complications and need for hospitalization are reduced). Blending direct user payment for self-care interventions with public subsidies and private-sector financing can help reduce large out-of-pocket expenditure on self-care for individuals and families."}

You may be able to access information and contraceptive services from a healthcare provider by phone or online. If you cannot access these services you may opt for a method that is available without a prescription (such as condoms, spermicides, diaphragm, pills, or emergency contraceptive pills) from a nearby pharmacy or drug shop."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "I can’t access my contraceptive method of choice. What do you advise?", "answer": "If you cannot access your contraceptive method of choice – perhaps because it requires a prescription, or because it can only be given to you by a health worker – consider using condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, lactational amenorrhea (if you are exclusively breastfeeding), or other contraceptive methods that are recommended for self-care in your country. Depending on the situation in your country, other methods recommended for self-care could include the pill or mini-pill, emergency contraception pills, and DMPA-SC (Sayana Press®)."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "What is the best contraceptive method to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy. Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you. There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best.  For more information see here . Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "I want to change my contraceptive method – is this possible?", "answer": "Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services. If you are experiencing side effects or desire urgent removal for other reasons, contact a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "I want to remove or replace my implant or IUD. Can I do this during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "Removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs, after the recommended period of use (and routine follow up appointments) is possible if the health facilities are accessible and operating during this health emergency. Seek advice from your health provider. If, due to restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, you cannot have your long acting method removed after the recommended period of use, it is important to use another method of contraception to avoid pregnancy at this time, as the method may not be effective after the recommended period. There are no medical problems caused by delaying removal of long-acting methods such as implants or IUDs. Do not try to remove the contraception method yourself; wait until you are able to access health care from a trained provider."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving. Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV). In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate unnecessary additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "I am a policy maker. What can I do to make sure people can access contraception and family planning information and services?", "answer": "Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure      as many eligible people as possible can access information and      contraception during this period. Increase use of mobile phones and digital      technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive      methods to use, and how they can be accessed. Enable health care workers to provide      contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the      full extent possible. This is particularly important where pregnancy poses      a high risk to health. Expand availability of contraceptive services      (including both information and methods) through places other than      healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms      and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending      on national guidelines and contraceptive method. Relax restrictions on the      number of repeat packages of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives      that can be issued. Ensure access to emergency post-coital      contraception, including consideration of over-the-counter provision. Enable access to contraception      for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods      when they may access health services."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contraception-and-family-planning", "question": "I am a healthcare provider. I have heard that persons with COVID-19 may have increased risk of blood clots. How should I advise individuals who are using or want to use combined hormonal contraception?", "answer": "According to currently available evidence , most women of childbearing age with COVID-19 will likely be asymptomatic or have mild COVID-19 symptoms and should continue to take combined hormonal contraception (CHC). Here are the most common possible scenarios: Women who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms of known COVID-19: combined hormonal contraception can be continued and is considered safe in this population. If women are concerned, their provider should explain that there is no evidence of increased risk of thrombosis among combined hormonal contraception users with mild COVID-19 symptoms. If a combined hormonal contraception user wishes to discontinue this method, she can be offered a progestin-only or non-hormonal method, if available and acceptable. Women with serious symptoms (1) of COVID-19 who are not hospitalized: Discontinuation of combined hormonal contraception should be considered, based on a patient’s clinical symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. immobilization for more than 7 days, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pneumonia). Considerations around stopping combined hormonal contraception should also take into account if the user has other medical conditions that may increase the risk of thrombosis during COVID-19. If combined hormonal contraception is discontinued, progestin-only or non-hormonal methods can be offered, if available and acceptable. Women hospitalized with severe COVID-19: Combined hormonal contraception should be discontinued during hospitalization. The risk of thrombosis in this acutely ill population may outweigh the benefits of continuing combined hormonal contraception. Progestin-only and non-hormonal contraceptive methods can be used. Women resuming contraception: It is important that all women who discontinue contraception during COVID-19 illness are given counselling about when to resume contraception and are provided with the method of their choice. Any new or existing medical conditions need to be considered when choosing a contraceptive method. Combined hormonal contraception can be resumed 2 weeks after any prolonged period of prolonged limited mobility (immobilization). the end of immobilization. Other methods can be started without delay. 1. Serious symptoms may include difficulty breathing or\r\nshortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement.

{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "Is 49 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10 000 population the recommended workforce density for all countries?", "answer": "The optimal health workforce density depends on the national and local context, including the burden of disease, demographics, skill mix of health workers, division of labour and distribution of health services. Countries included in the WHO health workforce support and safeguards list 2023 have a health workforce (medical doctors, nursing personnel and midwifery personnel) density less than the median of 49 per 10 000 population, and a universal health coverage (UHC) service coverage index less than 55. The application of these figures to the Support and safeguards list calculation does not imply that it is the health worker density recommended by WHO; rather, this is the threshold used to identify relative shortage of national stock of health workers when compared globally. WHO also recognizes that health workers other than medical doctors and nursing and midwifery personnel make substantial contributions to health outcomes. However, they have not been included in the analysis for Support and safeguards list because of limitations on data availability to allow for global comparison."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "Can a country choose whether to be on the Support and safeguards list?", "answer": "No, the Support and safeguards list does not entail the option to opt-in or opt-out. The WHO Secretariat publishes the Support and safeguards list based on objective criteria that are determined by a Member State-led Expert Advisory Group. Once the criteria, thresholds and policy recommendations for the Support and safeguards list have been agreed upon and finalized, WHO publishes the list of countries and shares them with the Expert Advisory Group, Member States and the public. The Support and safeguards list is scheduled to be updated every three years or earlier if necessary, following the criteria recommended by the Expert Advisory Group."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "Are the Expert Advisory Group recommendations binding?", "answer": "The WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel and the associated recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group and the Support and safeguards list are not legally binding. However, their provisions can become legally binding when countries adopt the Code and the Support and safeguards list (either elements of it or entirely) in their national policies. For example, countries could have policies to avoid active recruitment of health workers from countries with the highest health worker shortages but accept direct applications from individual health workers to vacancies in their countries. More information on specific countries’ adoption of the Code principles in national policies is available in the National Reporting Instruments database ."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "What health workforce safeguards does WHO recommend?", "answer": "WHO recommends refraining from active recruitment of health workers from countries in the Support and safeguards list . This means avoiding targeted approaches by employers or recruiting agencies to recruit large numbers of health workers from countries with workforce vulnerabilities. As essential safeguards, recruitment could take place through government-to-government agreements after consulting with ministries of health of source countries to ensure enough domestic supply of health workers and providing support to the source countries in priority areas identified by ministries of health. WHO also recommends destination countries, development partners, donors and national and international organizations prioritize support for health workforce development and health system strengthening in countries in the Support and safeguards list . These safeguards can be extended to other low- and middle-income countries."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "What do funds from recruiting countries support?", "answer": "The Code recommends supporting countries to strengthen health systems and health workforce. The needs of each country are unique and as such the ministries of health are best placed to decide on the priority areas that require support. Health system needs assessment, including health labour market analysis, can help inform and identify priority areas and the type of support required. Health workers are not commodities that can be bought. They are individuals who make their own decisions on where to work, as allowed by country laws. The health workforce also is a fundamental building block of health system. Therefore, countries need to formulate appropriate policies and to make strategic investments in health worker production, employment and retention to be self-sufficient on the health workforce. Destination countries could support the source countries in these endeavours as required and requested."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "What is the universal health coverage service coverage index?", "answer": "The UHC service coverage index (UHC SCI) is a measurement of the Sustainable Development Goal indicator 3.8.1 (coverage of essential health services). It is based on a set of 14 sub-indicators organized by four broad categories: reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and access. These sub-indicators are meant to be indicative of service coverage and should not be interpreted as a complete or exhaustive list of the health services or interventions that are required to achieve universal health coverage. The UHC SCI is measured as an index, reported on a unitless scale of 0 to 100 and computed as a geometric mean. More information on the UHC SCI is available in the publication Tracking universal health coverage: 2023 global monitoring report ."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "Will WHO comment on individual countries’ policies on migration?", "answer": "WHO does not comment on decisions of individual countries but shares available data and evidence reported by countries on the health workforce. The WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel is a voluntary instrument but reporting on its implementation is mandatory."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "Does the Support and safeguards list cover private sector recruitment?", "answer": "The WHO Health workforce support and safeguards list is the list of countries that face the most pressing health workforce challenges in the progress towards universal health coverage. WHO discourages active recruitment of health workers from these countries from both public and private sector employers or recruiters, to prevent exacerbation of workforce shortages. However, passive recruitment (where individual health workers respond to vacancies) and recruitment under the terms of bilateral agreements can take place; these practices may include an involvement of the private sector."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "Does the Support and safeguards list restrict individual health workers’ choices to migrate?", "answer": "The WHO global code of practice on the international recruitment of health personnel and the WHO health workforce support and safeguards list have no provisions limiting the individual pursuit of employment opportunities in other countries. Rather, they aim to discourage systematic and proactive approaches by employers or recruiting agencies to recruit large numbers of health workers from countries of origin with workforce vulnerabilities. In fact, the Code recommends fair and just recruitment and contractual practices for migrant health workers and promotes equal rights to education and career opportunities for people who migrate and domestic health workers."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "What is WHO doing to address the negative consequences of health worker migration?", "answer": "Migration is a long standing and ongoing phenomenon. Minimizing the negative consequences of international health worker migration requires addressing the health labour market failures as well as collaboration of source and destination countries. The WHO global code of practice on the international recruitment of health personnel is widely recognized as the overarching international framework that links the ethical international recruitment of health workers and the strengthening of health systems. Through the periodic reporting on the implementation of the Code, WHO highlights the trends, key issues and challenges related to international health worker mobility and policy advice to address it, including through publication of the WHO health workforce support and safeguards list , which identifies countries facing the most pressing health workforce challenges. The WHO guidance on bilateral agreements for health worker mobility and migration supports Member States to develop agreements related to health worker mobility and migration in a way that advances health system strengthening of participating countries and welfare of health workers."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "What can countries do to retain their health workers?", "answer": "Each country will have to assess its situation to develop and implement health workforce strategies that are suited to its context. Health workforce planning requires understanding of the labour market dynamics in each country and using the findings to inform investments in education, employment, and decent working conditions and design appropriate strategies and regulatory interventions. Management, support and retention of available health workforce to cater to population needs while ensuring their security is equally important. Destination countries should increase production of health workers to meet domestic needs. Source countries should invest through domestic financing and development assistance in health workforce education and retention. All countries should adopt workforce policies to absorb the health workers in their health systems and improve working conditions, including fair remuneration, to enhance retention. Health workforce planning and education policies will have to consider population health needs and likely workforce attrition due to international migration and other issues like retirement and departure from service. Development partners and international organizations should prioritize technical and financial support to countries in the WHO health workforce support and safeguards list and other low- and middle-income countries to strengthen health workforce and health systems."}
{"topic": "/who-health-workforce-support-and-safeguards-list", "question": "What is WHO recommendation on international recruitment from low- and middle-income countries that are not in the Support and safeguards list?", "answer": "The WHO health workforce support and safeguards list is based on health workforce and service coverage data available with WHO, and there is wide variation in the availability and quality of data across countries. Countries that are not in the Support and safeguards list have substantial difference in income levels, burden of disease, health systems and health workforce capacity. Therefore, as good practice, WHO recommends that policy recommendations for countries in the Support and safeguards list be extended to other low- and middle-income countries as necessary."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-investigational-vaccine-candidate-m72-as01e", "question": "What is the M72/AS01E vaccine candidate?", "answer": "M72/AS01E is a subunit candidate vaccine comprised of an immunogenic fusion protein (M72) derived from two Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens (MTB32A and MTB39A), and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) proprietary adjuvant AS01E. AS01E is the same adjuvant used in Shingrix GSK vaccine, as well as in the new malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01E."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-investigational-vaccine-candidate-m72-as01e", "question": "Who developed and who manufactured the vaccine?", "answer": "The M72/AS01E vaccine candidate was developed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with AERAS. AERAS was a not for profit organization based in the US, aimed at supporting tuberculosis vaccine research, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and other organizations. Current efforts are being coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute."}

This\r\nwas a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial\r\nparticipating 3573 HIV negative adults (18-50 years old) in Southern Africa\r\n(2873 from South Africa, 162 from Zambia, 538 from Kenya) who had evidence of\r\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection at baseline (IGRA+) vaccinated with\r\nM72/AS01E or placebo on a 2 dose schedule administered at 1 month interval. The\r\nprimary endpoint was the development of pulmonary TB. This was a case driven\r\nanalysis, where analysis was triggered by the accrual of a certain number of\r\npulmonary TB cases. The\r\nresults showed that administering two-doses of M72/AS01E was successful in\r\nreducing the development of active TB disease with 50% efficacy (90% CI, 12 to\r\n71) in HIV negative adults with latent M.tb infection. A total of 39\r\nparticipants contributed to the primary vaccine efficacy analysis during 3\r\nyears of follow up: 13 participants vaccinated with M72/AS01E developed\r\npulmonary TB, as compared to 26 participants in the placebo group."}

{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-investigational-vaccine-candidate-m72-as01e", "question": "Is the efficacy reported adequate to have an impact on disease burden and spread?", "answer": "WHO\r\nhas produced guidance expressing a preference for at least 50% efficacy against\r\nprevention of disease in adults and adolescents. It will be important to\r\ndetermine whether the M72/AS01E candidate vaccine is safe and is likely to\r\noffer benefit in people who have not previously been infected with M.tb, in\r\npeople living with HIV and in people across different geographical regions."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-investigational-vaccine-candidate-m72-as01e", "question": "Will this vaccine protect against the development of drug resistant TB?", "answer": "This\r\nhas not been evaluated in the studies to date. However, a vaccine protective\r\nagainst pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, if used widely, has the potential to\r\nreduce drug resistant tuberculosis by reducing transmission and preventing the\r\nneed for antibiotics; essential steps for curbing anti-microbial resistance.\r\nThe role of this candidate vaccine in limiting the development and spread of\r\ndrug-resistant forms of TB disease should be further evaluated."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-investigational-vaccine-candidate-m72-as01e", "question": "What is the difference between the phase 2b study that has demonstrated initial efficacy and this phase 3 study?", "answer": "This\r\nphase 3 study has a larger number of participants, to further assess the\r\nefficacy of the M72/AS01E candidate in adults and older adolescents who have\r\npreviously been exposed to M.tb., as well as to generate safety and\r\nimmunogenicity data inadolescents and adults who have not been previously\r\nexposed to M.tb and people living with HIV."}

{"topic": "/obesity-health-consequences-of-being-overweight", "question": "What are the health consequences of being overweight?", "answer": "Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health.\r\n Carrying extra fat leads to serious health consequences such as \r\ncardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 \r\ndiabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some \r\ncancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause \r\npremature death and substantial disability. What is not widely known is that the risk of health problems \r\nstarts when someone is only very slightly overweight, and that the \r\nlikelihood of problems increases as someone becomes more and more \r\noverweight. Many of these conditions cause long-term suffering for \r\nindividuals and families. In addition, the costs for the health care \r\nsystem can be extremely high. The good news is that overweight and obesity are largely \r\npreventable.

{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "What is a WHO Listed Authority?", "answer": "A WHO Listed Authority (WLA) is a regulatory authority (RA) or a regional regulatory system (RRS) that complies with all the relevant indicators and requirements specified by WHO for regulatory capability as defined by an established benchmarking and performance evaluation process. A regulatory authority provides the framework that supports the WHO recommended regulatory functions. This is the authority and affiliated institutions that are responsible for regulatory oversight of medical products in a given country or region and in charge of assuring the quality, safety and efficacy of medical products as well as ensuring the relevance and accuracy of product information. The WLA replaces the Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) definition. The WLA framework offers a modular approach as a regulatory authority that can be designated for a specific regulatory function or a specific type of products (see question 12 on the scope for the listing). They differ by the designation mechanism; the definition of an SRA, first published by the Global Fund in 2008, was based on membership in the International Conference (now Council) of Harmonization (ICH) as before October 2015. The WLA framework offers a modern, transparent and evidence-based framework to identify trusted authorities and giving the opportunity to new regulatory authorities to be designated as WLA. The WLA framework offers a modular approach as a regulatory authority can be designated for a specific regulatory function or a specific type of product (see question 7 on the scope for the listing)."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "What criteria should be met for a regulatory authority to be eligible for the WLA evaluation process?", "answer": "National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) or Regional Regulatory Authorities (RRAs) must at least have attained overall Maturity Level 3 (ML3) as established by the Global Benchmarking Tool or be included in the list of transitional WLAs ( tWLA ) to be eligible for consideration as a WLA. Additionally, the RA should apply for the evaluation process and demonstrate a high level of performance, by complying with all the requirements laid down in the performance evaluation process specifically developed for each of the regulatory functions for which listing is sought. The transitional arrangement is planned for 5 years, until the end of March 2027. Placement on the transitional list does not confer WLA status and does not alter requirements to be met for designation as a WLA."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "How can a regulatory authority become a WHO Listed Authority (WLA)?", "answer": "To be designated as WLA, a regulatory authority should undergo i) a formal assessment with the WHO-Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) to demonstrate adequate maturity (ML3 as entry point) and ii) a performance evaluation (PE) process that complements the results of benchmarking, confirming consistency of advanced performance against international standards and best practices. Some transitional arrangements are in place for previously designated stringent regulatory authorities and regulatory authorities which had been previously assessed by WHO. RAs that have reached a high-level regulatory capability and performance (WLA) may be used as a reference and to be relied on by other authorities, to avoid duplicating activities, foster better use of human and economic resources, increase oversight of the pharmaceutical products along the whole supply chain to ultimately enhance global access to high quality, efficacious and safe medicines and vaccines."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "What is the performance evaluation process and how does it differ from the Global Benchmarking Tool?", "answer": "While the benchmarking process and tool provides a robust and structured approach to measure the existence and implementation of a legal framework, organizational structure, resources and processes to perform regulatory activities, the performance evaluation process provides a more detailed picture of how a regulatory system operates, its level of performance and ultimately its effectiveness and the quality of the scientific outputs. The performance evaluation (PE) process considers the nature and extent of evaluation required to provide confidence in the authority’s output and performance. While designed to document that a regulatory system consistently performs well (i.e. adheres to international standards and results in sound regulatory decisions), the PE will also consider all available information and evidence such as formal assessments performed by other internationally recognized bodies to avoid unnecessary duplication of evaluations."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "How long is the WLA Listing valid for?", "answer": "A listing will initially be valid for a period of 5 years. A risk-based process will be used to renew the initial listing. Once renewed, the listing will no longer be subject to a validity period but to continuous monitoring based on risk management principles to ensure that requirements for the listing continue to be met. This includes the commitment to and compliance with regular reporting requirements by the WLA. In case of major changes in the regulatory system with potential impact on the listing decision or listing information, the re-evaluation of the regulatory agency will be conducted."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "What is the scope of the WHO Listed Authorities in terms of type of products and how it is determined?", "answer": "The initial scope of the WLA designation is limited to medicines and vaccines, with an option to expand to other categories of products, in line with the expansion of the scope of the GBT (for example blood and derivatives, medical devices including in vitro diagnostics (IVD), advanced therapies etc.). The listing as WLA indicates the specific scope of products for which the regulatory authority is listed, for example vaccines and medicines including multisource (generics) and new medicines (new chemical entities), biotherapeutics and similar biotherapeutic products. The WLA framework is voluntary, and an NRA or RRS can apply for being listed for one or more product categories and/or for one or more regulatory functions. In the case of product categories – for example vaccines and medicines including multisource (generics) and new medicines (new chemical entities), biotherapeutics and similar biotherapeutic products – all regulatory functions will be assessed, as they form an inter-related framework for ensuring the proper regulatory oversight of products over their lifecycle. In the case of regulatory functions – for example registration and marketing authorization (MA), vigilance (VL), market surveillance and control (MC), licensing establishments (LI), regulatory inspection (RI), laboratory testing (LT), clinical trial oversight (CT) and national regulatory authority lot release (LR) – a modular approach for each regulatory function will be followed, as defined by the Operational guidance, to encourage stepwise investment and subsequent recognition in regulatory system strengthening. In both options, compliance with all GBT indicators specified for a ML3 regulatory system would be a pre-requisite for consideration as a WLA. Note: for additional information click here ."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "What is a transitional WLA?", "answer": "A transitional WLA ( tWLA ) is a Regulatory Authority (RA) previously included in the WHO Interim list of regulatory authorities (published by WHO from 2019 to 2022), which compiled all RAs already recognized by WHO that work at an acceptable level of regulatory performance before the introduction of the WLA concept. A transitional WLA is not a WLA, in that it still needs to undergo the performance evaluation process and demonstrate compliance with the requirements to be designated as a WLA. The transitional list will be valid until 31 March 2027. During this time, tWLAs are expected to apply for being subject to the performance evaluation (PE) to be able to transition either to the permanent WLA list or the list of RAs operating at ML3/4 ."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "How can the WLA concept help to improve the efficiency of regulatory systems?", "answer": "The principle of reliance is central to WHO’s approach to regulatory system strengthening and a cornerstone for effective, efficient and smart regulatory oversight of medical products. Relying on the work and decisions of WLAs by other regulatory authorities or procurement agencies reduce redundancy and waste of limited regulatory and financial resources thus contributing to improve the efficiency of regulatory systems. The WLA framework is ultimately promoting access to safe, effective, and quality medicines and vaccines."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "Is it necessary to achieve high-level performance in all regulatory functions to be listed as WLA?", "answer": "No. A WLA must have attained ML3 through the WHO GBT assessment in all functions and should demonstrate compliance with all the additional performance evaluation requirements only for the function(s) and/or product category(ies) for which listing is sought (see question 6)."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "Will a negative result in the performance evaluation process have an impact on the maturity level (ML) of the NRAs, and consequently on prequalified products?", "answer": "No. A negative decision for WLA listing has no impact on the ML reached through GBT, and accordingly, no consequence is foreseen on prequalified medical products."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "If a product has been authorized by a regulatory authority before its designation as a WLA, can reliance be still applied?", "answer": "The performance evaluation process that leads to the designation of a regulatory authority as a WLA aim to verify consistency of implementation of good regulatory practices over time, and this is generally achieved by assessing the regulatory performance up to three years before the WLA designation. However, the responsibility to rely on WLA’s regulatory decisions stands with the user and is specific for the intended use."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "How will the WLA list be used in the context of the prequalification process?", "answer": "The WHO prequalification team will use the WLA list to facilitate abridged assessment for prequalification and avoid duplication of efforts and repetition of assessment, where possible. The type of products and regulatory functions listed for the WLA will be taken into consideration for the relevant abridged assessment."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "Can the list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities still be used?", "answer": "Until the full transition of SRAs to WLAs, stakeholders may want to refer to the list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities for regulatory reliance."}
{"topic": "/who-listed-authorities", "question": "How do benchmarking and maturity level and how WLA concept impact procurement of healthcare products?", "answer": "The Global Benchmarking Tool and the maturity levels concept have been developed for capacity-building purposes only. The decision to procure medical products from a manufacturer in a country with a regulatory authority that have attained a certain maturity level following the WHO’s benchmarking remain solely with the procurement agency who is independent, responsible and accountable for its decisions. WLAs are recognized by WHO as regulatory authorities operating at high level of performance and as such considered for reliance in the specific functions mentioned in the WLA designation. The ultimate responsibility and decision for use of tWLA and WLA lists resides with the users (for example, regulatory authorities, procurement agencies) and will depend on the specific context of its intended use."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "Why is it important to be deaf or hard of hearing friendly?", "answer": "Being deaf or hard of hearing friendly is crucial to fostering inclusivity and ensuring effective communication with individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. It promotes a supportive environment that allows everyone to participate fully in social activities. Nearly 20% of people experience some degree of hearing loss and this percentage is increasing. Hence it is likely that we will need to communicate with people who are deaf or hard of hearing in our daily life. Being aware of good communication strategies for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing will allow us to be better communicators with everyone."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "What should I keep in mind when interacting with someone who is deaf or hard of hearing?", "answer": "Face the person. This allows them to see your face, making it easier to lip-read and understand facial expressions. Communicate visually using your face, body and hands to express yourself. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Avoid shouting, as it can distort speech and make lip-reading challenging. Clear and deliberate speech is easier to understand. Use visual cues from your direct environment. Based on what is available in the environment where you are, refer to visible elements that can help clarify some concepts such as colours, persons concerned, pictograms and locations. Do not exaggerate or distort lip movements. Maintain natural lip movements while speaking to facilitate lip-reading. Use the materials you have. Write on paper, type on your phone or computer, point to the words/illustrations used in the presentation slides, or make drawings. Speak one at a time and avoid talking over others, as this can create confusion. Speaking one at a time helps the person who is hard of hearing or deaf focus on the speaker. Take advantage of new technologies. Exploit the potential from your smartphone or tablet such as using voice-to-text apps, remote sign language interpretation services, and digital sign language dictionaries. Reduce background noise or move to a quieter setting. Excessive background noise hinders communication, especially for people who are deaf and hard of hearing. Learn basic signs and fingerspelling. When you can plan the interaction ahead of time, take the opportunity to learn basic signs and fingerspelling in the national sign language used by the person who is deaf. Don’t say “I’ll tell you later”, as this excludes those who are deaf and hard of hearing from the immediate conversation, making them feel isolated. Instead, strive to include them by finding ways to convey information at that moment."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "As a teacher, how do I support a child who is deaf or hard of hearing in the classroom?", "answer": "Ask children what they need as reasonable accommodations from you, the students, and the school staff and be an ally. Seat the child in front of the class, when possible and with child’s consent, and face the child directly while speaking. Support children who use hearing aids or implants by learning how to troubleshoot common problems, like changing batteries. Encourage children to let you know when they are not hearing others and need them to repeat themselves. Encourage other children in the class to communicate accordingly such as learning the child’s national sign language or using visual communication. Use hearing induction loop and frequency modulation (FM) systems as these can ensure smoother communication for children using hearing aids or implants. Teach children to self-advocate for their needs at home and at school. For example, encourage children to inform their teacher or parents when the hearing aid stops working. Encourage parents to disclose their child’s disability and not to hide it. Include the child in all activities and encourage other children to do the same. Facilitate the encounters between the child and other peers and adult role models who are also deaf or hard of hearing. Look into whether the child has hearing loss if a child is not performing well in class by encouraging parents to get the child’s hearing checked."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "How can society include people who are deaf or hard of hearing in various activities?", "answer": "Through: ensuring accessible communication: written information, subtitles or captions, professional national sign language interpreters, will facilitate access to communication, learning and using the national sign language; and facilitating the use of assistive devices such as hearing aids or implants, FM, infrared and hardwired systems, and hearing induction loops."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "How can public spaces be made deaf and hard of hearing friendly?", "answer": "Installation of visual alerts: Incorporate visual alerts for important announcements, such as flashing lights or scrolling text, to supplement auditory notifications. Provision of hearing induction loop systems: Install hearing loop systems that transmit audio directly to hearing aids, enhancing sound quality for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Training of staff on communication techniques: Educate staff members on effective communication strategies and the importance of accommodating individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "How can employers support people who are deaf or hard of hearing in the workplace?", "answer": "Employers can support staff who are deaf or hard of hearing by: making them aware of reasonable accommodation available to them; ensuring all meetings are made accessible for people who are deaf or hard of hearing; for example, holding them in well-lit spaces with clear visuals, providing captions or professional national sign language interpreters, and following up with written summaries; making virtual meetings accessible by using good audio equipment for clear audibility, providing professional national sign language interpreters, providing the possibility to multipin, and mandating that participants speak with their cameras on to facilitate lip reading or interpretation; fostering an environment where colleagues feel comfortable discussing their hearing/visual needs; and allowing for flexible work arrangements or breaks to manage appointments related to hearing health."}
{"topic": "/how-to-be-hearing-loss-friendly", "question": "How can I be an advocate for hearing loss prevention and hearing care?", "answer": "Be an advocate for hearing loss prevention and hearing care by: consulting persons who are deaf and hard of hearing or their representative organizations on what you can do to support them and be their ally; participating in awareness campaigns that raise awareness about hearing loss, deafness and hard of hearing, its challenges, and its solutions; advocating with businesses and public spaces to invest in accessibility features, such as captioning, hearing loops, sign language translations and visual alerts; disseminating information about people who are deaf and hard of hearing, their communication needs, and how individuals and communities can become deaf and hard of hearing friendly; being a role model by becoming deaf and hard of hearing friendly, checking your hearing regularly, and encouraging others to do the same; learning the national sign language of your country by attending courses provided by deaf sign language teachers; volunteer with organizations focused on hearing health to further their efforts in creating awareness and providing resources; and organizing World Hearing Day activities or events to raise awareness in communities."}
{"topic": "/tetanus-immunization", "question": "Should tetanus immunizations be given to survivors with injuries in emergency situations?", "answer": "In emergency situations where there are serious injuries, tetanus immunization has to be taken into consideration. As tetanus is a complication of wounds and injuries, it is essential that injured people receive appropriate surgical and medical care of contaminated open wounds. Open wounds must be considered as contaminated and should not be closed. Debridement and removal of dead tissue and debris is essential, and depending on the size of the wound may necessitate a surgical procedure undertaken in appropriate conditions. Wounds should be dressed with sterile dressings and the patient scheduled for delayed primary closure. Tetanus immunization is usually provided to victims of natural disasters on an as-needed basis for several reasons. In addition, passive immunization using TIG, preferably of human origin, may be needed for prophylaxis in cases of dirty wounds in incompletely immunized patients. TIG is essential in the treatment and prophylaxis of tetanus cases and should be readily available in all countries. Types of tetanus vaccines TT - Tetanus Toxoid vaccine DTP - Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine DT - Diphtheria toxoid and Tetanus toxoid vaccine Td - Tetanus toxoid and Diphtheria toxoid vaccine (low dose diphtheria) First, it is not communicable from person-to-person. Second, in many parts of the world, most people have already some protection against tetanus through immunization. In summary, tetanus prevention can be achieved during emergencies through: Careful cleaning of wounds, both deep and superficial, can substantially decrease the risk of tetanus. Protecting cleaned wounds from recontamination with dressings, and/or topical disinfectants also is important. Protective clothing and closed shoes, if available, should be worn by anyone engaged in clearing away or sifting through debris. If possible, TT vaccination should be offered to anyone engaged in debris clean-up and construction. For those who have not received TT in the past, or for whom past vaccination is uncertain, a second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first. The first dose will not provide protection to those who have not previously been vaccinated, but will rather prime the body to produce anti-tetanus immunity with the second dose given at-least 4 weeks later. If feasible, vaccination with TT-containing vaccine should be offered to all internally displaced people who have not received at least 3 previous doses. Because tetanus risk is high in disaster areas, and because the immunization status of most persons will be unknown, it will be worthwhile to provide doses of TT-containing vaccine, even if only one dose can be assured. Tetanus immunoglobulins may be required for managing those with deep wounds. In emergencies where prior tetanus toxoid immunization levels were low, special attention should be given to preventing maternal and neonatal tetanus, by immunizing women of childbearing age and by improving the hygienic conditions under which childbirths take place. Routine immunization of women and children should also be re-established as soon as possible."}
{"topic": "/disinformation-and-public-health", "question": "What are misinformation and disinformation? How do they differ?", "answer": "Misinformation is the spread of false information without the intent to mislead. Those who share the misinformation may believe it is true, useful or interesting, and have no malicious intent towards the recipients they are sharing it with. Disinformation is designed or spread with full knowledge of it being false (information has been manipulated), as part of an intention to deceive and cause harm. The motivations can be economic gain, ideological, religious, political or in support of a social agenda among others. Both misinformation and disinformation may cause harm, which comprises threats to decision-making processes as well as health, environment or security. The key difference between disinformation and misinformation is not the content of the falsehood but the knowledge and intention of the sender."}
{"topic": "/disinformation-and-public-health", "question": "How does information manipulation affect public health?", "answer": "Disinformation in public health is a distinct type of information risk which, unlike misinformation, is created with malicious intent to sow discord, disharmony and mistrust in targets such as government agencies, scientific experts, public health agencies, private sector and law enforcement, among others. The potential impacts of disinformation can be understood through examples during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had two key elements that created the perfect storm for disinformation to proliferate and spread. First, it swiftly caused global fear, uncertainty and doubt. Second, it occurred at a point in history where we can easily access, create and share information (as well as misinformation and disinformation) widely over the internet, mobile telecommunications, media and social media platforms. As the pandemic took hold, many posts appeared on social media and spread through instant messaging communications, stoking uncertainty about the treatment, the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, the usefulness of social distancing, and more. This caused social protest, turmoil, delayed vaccine uptake and led to higher death rates in some instances."}
{"topic": "/disinformation-and-public-health", "question": "Why would anyone spread health-related disinformation?", "answer": "The creation and spread of disinformation during public health crises is a not a new phenomenon and has existed in different forms for centuries. Disinformation has been noted in association with events such as the bubonic plague in as far back as the 14th century, cholera outbreaks in the 19th century and the influenza pandemics including the devastating 1918–19 pandemic in the 20th century. Modern day disinformation campaigns have been associated with the emergence of the HIV in the 1980s and more recently the spread of Ebola, COVID-19 and mpox. The motives of those who create disinformation are complex. In the older historical examples, the objective of the disinformation campaigns was to find ways to blame marginalized groups for the spread of disease and cause them harm. More modern disinformation campaigns evolved to be a part of geopolitical tensions as different groups sought to find ways place to accuse each other of causing the emergence of a disease and, additionally, to hamper the efficacy of their public health interventions (e.g. vaccine uptake and social isolation policies during COVID-19). Often, it is part of a larger agenda to sow confusion over facts and their sources, exacerbate divisive political fissures, erode trust in civil and scientific institutions, or undermine citizen confidence in governance. It can also be used for financial gain, to build a social media following, or to make a particular group appear superior to another based on how they are responding to a public health crisis. Security agencies have noted how extremist groups have leveraged disinformation to build their popularity for recruitment and legitimization. Understanding the history and background of the disinformation is critical to develop countering strategies."}
{"topic": "/disinformation-and-public-health", "question": "How can Member States counter health-related disinformation?", "answer": "WHO and partners have developed various strategies and tools which can be applied to tackle misinformation and disinformation. Disinformation is often difficult to detect and mitigate. This is because successful disinformation campaigns typically draw on elements of truth that may be manipulated, distrust against governments and institutions, and conspiracy theories already present and circulating within groups. However, Member States can use a range of tactics to counter disinformation, including: raising awareness of disinformation and information manipulation; promoting critical thinking; promoting digital, health and scientific literacy programmes; promoting trusted sources of information and voices of authority – these should provide clear and timely information about the event and evolving situation including knowns and unknowns, what is being done and when updates will be provided; supporting fact-checking activities which includes the use of fact-checking technologies and human fact-checkers; working with relevant stakeholders, such as the security sector, social media providers, law enforcement, cyber agencies, NGOs and international organizations to tackle this new threat; and identifying drivers of (mis)trust in populations, and how those drivers are exploited to create disinformation campaigns. These drivers can inform long term solutions to guard against disinformation."}
{"topic": "/disinformation-and-public-health", "question": "How can I protect myself from health-related disinformation?", "answer": "Think critically and pause before sharing. When encountering new information, everyone should ask themselves: Is this content reliable? Who is the author? What is the source of the claims? Is the information outlet reliable? How do I feel about this piece of      information? One of the most important things you can do to protect yourself is to find out which sources represent the latest official and evidence-based health or scientific facts about a public health issue or crisis. For example, this could be your country’s Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization’s website, or your local health clinic. You can help your community by guiding your family and friends to these trusted sources and advise them to avoid acting on false information that’s spread through social media, online advertising or instant messaging."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "What is a cyber-attack?", "answer": "A cyber-attack is an attempt to deliberately harm a person(s) or organization by attacking their digital systems (e.g. computers) to steal, tamper with, disrupt access to, or destroy the data or applications they consider confidential and/or are dependent on. Cyber-attacks are more common when a person or organization has systems that are connected to the internet. Cyber attackers will often try to trick people into giving them access to these systems by sending them e-mails which contain attachments or links that seem legitimate but when clicked on lead to the attacker gaining access to the person’s computer and/or an organization’s network."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "Why is health care prone to cyber-attacks?", "answer": "The emergence of health care as a preferred target for cyber-attacks is relatively recent. Health care, including hospitals, clinics and health insurance, are increasingly undergoing digital transformation to the benefit of patients and cost-efficiency of their services. This is often happening without enough attention being paid to the new risks this brings to the table. The vast amount of critical digital information held by health services (e.g. within patient monitoring systems/electronic health records), coupled with inadequate security (lack of staff awareness and technical safeguards) makes them a prime target for cyber-criminals. For cyber-criminals, withholding access to these time-sensitive data and systems for a ransom is an easy money-making exercise. Cyber-criminals have recognized and learned to exploit this at scale for financial benefit over the past decade. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare organizations increased their use of digital systems and rapid access to patient data became critical, prompting cyber-criminals to target healthcare as they thought ransoms were more likely to be paid due to the critical nature of the data and systems they were locking access to."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "What is ransomware?", "answer": "Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that infects digital systems and prevents end-users from accessing data and applications by encrypting key information. For access to be returned, the perpetrators extort a fee (a ransom) to be paid. Payments are generally requested in cryptocurrencies, which are more difficult for criminal justice authorities to trace."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "How does a cyber-attack affect patients?", "answer": "Cyber-attack can have different effects. Cyber-attack can have a direct impact on patient safety and care delivery in a variety of ways. For example, when a healthcare organization is hit with a cyber-attack, the attackers may gain access to sensitive patient data, including personal information, medical histories and even financial information. In some extreme cases, cyber-attacks have even led to the shutdown of entire healthcare facilities, putting patients’ lives at risk. Ransomware attacks that lock access to critical healthcare IT systems often cause disruption that leads to cancelled outpatient appointments and elective surgical operations. In more serious attacks, emergency rooms have had to turn ambulances away or cancer centres have had to postpone treatment for their patients. More recently, there have been cyber-attack  to steal mental health records where the attackers have ultimately published the confidential records online, demonstrating how cyber-attack can impact both the physical and mental well-being of the victims."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "Are there any other types of health critical infrastructure that are at risk?", "answer": "The healthcare supply chain involves more than just hospitals and health clinics. It includes biotechnology companies, logistics companies, vaccine manufacturers, academic research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, diagnostic laboratories, health IT suppliers, digital infrastructure vendors and medical device manufacturers. All these organizations are increasingly interconnected through digital technology and have been targeted by cyber-attacks."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "What is cybersecurity maturity?", "answer": "Cybersecurity maturity is your organization’s level of readiness to defend itself and its digital assets against cyber-attack. During the COVID-19 pandemic, no continent was spared these types of attacks and the healthcare sector continues to be the top targeted sector even after the pandemic. The more mature your program, the better able you are to mitigate digital threats and keep business running as usual despite cyber threats and challenges. As the threat landscape intensifies and artificial intelligence is unleashed in full force, sophisticated cybersecurity maturity is now needed and necessary."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "How can we protect health critical infrastructure?", "answer": "It is important for Member States and the health sector to consider enhancing their cyber maturity in preparation for cyber-attack. This involves investing in people, processes and technology, including through cyber awareness training and development of incident response plans to be rehearsed by staff in anticipation of a cyber-attack. It is critical to increase communication and collaboration with law enforcement agencies (e.g. police, INTERPOL), governmental agencies (e.g. cyber security agency, public health institute, national agency for the safety of medicines and health products, nuclear safety agency), private sector and non-governmental organizations; these entities can provide alerts and warnings about ongoing cyber-attack."}
{"topic": "/cyber-attacks-on-critical-health-infrastructure", "question": "Is a cyber-attack on a hospital considered as an attack on a health care facility?", "answer": "A cyber-attack on a hospital is considered as an attack on a health care facility. WHO defines an attack as any act of verbal or physical violence, threat of violence or other psychological violence, or obstruction that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services. There are different types of attacks that are described in this infographic ."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "Are e-cigarettes dangerous?", "answer": "ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions. E-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to both users and non-users who are exposed to the aerosols second-hand. Some products claiming to be nicotine-free (ENNDS) have been found to contain nicotine. Nicotine exposure in pregnant women can adversely affect the development of the fetus.  Further, the consumption of nicotine in children and adolescents has negative impacts on brain development, leading to long-term consequences for brain development and potentially leading to learning and anxiety disorders. Nicotine is highly addictive and harmful to health. Additionally, high quality epidemiology studies consistently demonstrate that e-cigarettes use increases conventional cigarette uptake, particularly among non-smoking youth, by nearly 3 times. Evidence reveals that these products are harmful to health and are not safe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impact of using them or being exposed to them. Whilst long-term health effects are not fully known, we do know that they generate toxic substances, some of which are known to cause cancer and some that increase the risk of heart and lung disorders. Electronic delivery systems have also been linked to a number of physical injuries, including burns from explosions or malfunctions, when the products are not of the expected standard or are tampered with by users. Accidental exposure of children to ENDS e-liquids pose serious risks as devices may leak or children may swallow the poisonous e-liquid."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "Do e-cigarettes (ENDS) cause lung injuries?", "answer": "There is growing evidence that ENDS could be associated with lung injuries. E-cigarettes have also been linked to an episode of lung injury in the United States of America. This is described by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury (EVALI), which led the CDC to activate an emergency investigation into EVALI on 17 September 2019. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted, “As of 18 February 2020, there have been a total of 2,807 cases of EVALI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, including 68 deaths confirmed in 29 states and the District of Columbia. While the cause of these deaths has not been conclusively determined, vitamin E acetate (VEA), a common additive in ENDS that contains cannabis (or THC), is thought to have played a significant role in these cases of lung injury. Further information on this incident, including a strong link of the EVALI outbreak to Vitamin E Acetate and the latest report, is available here , which is updated every week, as the evidence is not sufficient to exclude the contribution of other chemicals.”"}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "Are e-cigarettes more or less dangerous than conventional tobacco cigarettes?", "answer": "Both tobacco products and ENDS pose risks to health. The safest approach is not to use either. The levels of risk associated with using ENDS or tobacco products are likely to depend on a range of factors, some relating to the products used and some to the individual user. Factors include product type and characteristics, how the products are used, including frequency of use, how the products are manufactured, who is using the product, user behaviour – user’s puffing style – and whether product characteristics are manipulated post-sale. Toxicity is not the only factor in considering risk to an individual or a population from exposure to ENDS emissions. These factors may include the potential for abusing or manipulating the product, use by children and adolescents who otherwise would not have used cigarettes, simultaneous use with other tobacco products (dual or poly use) and children and adolescents going on to use smoked products following experimentation with ENDS. Dual use, which is common, is at least as dangerous and likely more dangerous than smoking conventional cigarettes or using e-cigarettes alone. Further, not all ENDS are the same and the risks to health may differ from one product to another, and from user to user."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "Are ENDS addictive?", "answer": "Nicotine is highly addictive. A non-smoker who uses ENDS may become addicted to nicotine and find it difficult to stop using ENDS or become addicted to conventional tobacco products. Further, many e-cigarettes are designed to allow the control of nicotine (which can reach dangerously high levels). This can also increase the levels of other toxicants to the user and also expose bystanders to harmful emissions."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "Are second-hand ENDS emissions dangerous?", "answer": "The aerosols generated by ENDS typically raise the concentration of particulate matter in indoor environments and contain nicotine and other potentially toxic substances. ENDS emissions therefore pose potential risks to both users and non-users."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "What are the policy options for regulating ENDS?", "answer": "How a country approaches ENDS will depend on factors particular to its situation. ENDS are currently banned in about 35 countries worldwide. In others they are regulated as consumer products, as pharmaceutical products, as tobacco products, in other categories or totally unregulated. The following are recommended: w here countries ban the sale of e-cigarettes , to strengthen      implementation of the ban and continue monitoring and surveillance to      support public health interventions and ensure strong enforcement; and w here countries permit commercialization (sale, importation, distribution and manufacture) of e-cigarettes as consumer products, to ensure strong regulations to reduce their appeal and their harm to the population, including banning all flavours, limiting the concentration and quality of nicotine, and taxing them. WHO further recommends: w here countries pursue a smoking cessation strategy      utilizing e-cigarettes , to carefully      weigh national circumstances and the risk of uptake, and exhaust other      proven cessation strategies. The conditions under which the products are accessed      should be controlled to ensure appropriate clinical conditions and the      products should be regulated as medicines, rather than their sale      permitted as consumer products. The tobacco industry profits from destroying health and is using these newer products to get a seat at the policy making table with governments to lobby against health policies. WHO is concerned that the tobacco industry funds and promotes false evidence to argue that these products reduce harm, while at the same time heavily promoting these products to children and non-smokers and continuing to sell billions of cigarettes."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "What role do ENDS play in smoking cessation?", "answer": "E-cigarettes as consumer products have not been proven to be effective for cessation at the population level. Instead, alarming evidence on adverse population health effects is mounting. To truly help tobacco users quit and to strengthen global tobacco control, governments need to scale up policies and interventions that we know work. Tried and tested interventions, such as brief advice from health professionals, national toll-free quit lines and mobile and digital cessation services are recommended. Where economically feasible, governments should also consider promoting nicotine replacement therapies and non-nicotine pharmacotherapies for cessation."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-e-cigarettes", "question": "What is WHO doing about ENDS?", "answer": "WHO regularly monitors and reviews the evidence on ENDS and health and offers guidance to governments. This includes the biennial WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic , which tracks the status of the tobacco epidemic and interventions to combat it and other relevant resources . WHO stresses that Member States should implement a comprehensive approach to tobacco control which includes raising tobacco excise taxes, bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, health warnings, smoke-free areas, mass-media campaigns and supporting people to quit with proven tools such as advice from healthcare workers, toll-free quit lines, mobile and digital cessation services, and approved therapies. Strong decisive action is needed to prevent the uptake of e-cigarettes based on the growing body of evidence of use by children and adolescents and health harms. WHO strives to build a safer, healthier world for everyone, everywhere."}

{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "When should I get tested for mpox (also known as monkeypox)?", "answer": "If you are experiencing an unexplained skin rash or lesions inside your mouth or genital area you should seek medical care. After considering your medical history, symptoms and potential exposures, your healthcare provider will advise you on whether you need to be tested for mpox. If you know you have been in close contact with someone else with mpox and you have symptoms, you should ask your healthcare provider to be tested. Close contact can mean face-to-face (such as talking); skin-to-skin (such as touching or anal or vaginal sex); mouth-to-mouth (such as kissing); or mouth-to-skin contact (such as oral sex). Common symptoms of mpox include rash, swollen lymph nodes, fever and body aches, but they can also be more general such as headache, fatigue and a sore throat. Some people also experience a rash or swelling around the genital area or anus or pain and inflammation of the rectum (proctitis). There is more detailed information about mpox symptoms on this infographic 1 . You should carefully monitor for symptoms if you have been in contact with someone who has mpox. You can also contact your healthcare provider who can support you as you monitor for symptoms."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "Why should I get tested if I have mpox symptoms?", "answer": "If you have symptoms, getting tested for mpox is important for your health and to protect people around you.  It is the first step towards making a full recovery without complications. Knowing if you have mpox will enable you to get the right support in a timely manner. While most people with mpox recover on their own, some people will need social support, counselling and medical care which may include pain management and antibiotics. Some people have a higher risk of complications if they have mpox. This includes children, people who are pregnant and people who are immunosuppressed including some people living with HIV. It is important for anyone in these high-risk groups who  is concerned they may have mpox to seek health advice, including getting tested and, if needed, receiving the appropriate care to manage their symptoms. Testing is also a vital tool in helping end the outbreak. If you test positive for mpox, take precautions to protect others by wearing a mask and covering your lesions. Precautions could also include a period of self-isolation until your lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath. Depending on your local context, local health authorities may carry out contact tracing to alert contacts of possible infections while respecting your confidentiality. If we are able to stop more people from getting infected, we can end the outbreak."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "How should I get tested if I think I have mpox?", "answer": "Your healthcare provider can advise you on testing options in your local area if they think you may have mpox. The first step is to have a sample collected. Usually, a sample is collected by a healthcare provider, but you may be given instructions on how to collect your own sample at home. Your sample will be sent to the laboratory to be tested and it may take a few days to receive the results. During this time your healthcare provider may also link you with support services including counselling, social support, and medical care if required. Since testing capacity for mpox is still limited around the world, WHO is working to support countries and ensure that everyone who needs a test has access to one."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "How should testing for mpox work?", "answer": "First, if you are getting testing in a health facility, you should be placed in a private room or area. Your healthcare provider will be wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for sample collection. A sample will be collected by swabbing your skin or mouth lesions and surrounding skin because lesion material is the best sample type and most likely to give an accurate test result. The healthcare provider may swab more than one of your lesions. If you do not have lesions other sample types might be collected, including a swab from the back of your throat (oropharyngeal swab) or from your genital and anal area (genital, anal and rectal swabs). Your healthcare provider will then send your sample to a laboratory where it will be tested for the monkeypox virus. Other possible causes of your lesions may be tested for, to arrive at a diagnosis. Depending on your local context, the lab will either contact you directly or the results will be returned to your healthcare provider. You should be contacted to receive the result and if necessary be referred for further care."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "What kinds of tests are available for mpox?", "answer": "Currently, mpox testing is done using a laboratory-based technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This type of test is widely used to diagnose many types of infections. At this time, PCR tests are the only method recommended to test for mpox . There are rapid tests in development that detect antigens (proteins) that are part of the virus. It is not known at this time how easily these antigens are detected, in which samples, or when in the course of infection they may be detected; therefore, we don’t yet know if rapid tests are accurate. Research is ongoing to understand whether and how well antigen tests can be used and with which samples. Because of this, antigen tests should not be used for testing of active infection with the monkeypox virus at this time. The immune response following infection with monkeypox virus can be checked through antibody tests (sometimes called serological tests). As these tests do not detect the virus itself, they only indicate that you have been exposed to the virus and are not recommended as the sole test for the diagnosis of mpox. Antibody tests are mostly used for research purposes and are not widely available."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "How accurate are the results?", "answer": "Positive results from samples taken from lesions are generally very accurate in identifying cases of mpox. It is very unlikely you will get a positive result (false positive) if you do not have mpox. False negative results, where the result is negative, but the individual does have mpox, are uncommon. They may happen if the sample was collected quite early or late in the course of the illness, as there may have been less virus in the sample. This means that although the test result is negative you might have mpox infection. Results from other sample types, such as throat, genital, anal or rectal swabs, may be less accurate than samples taken from lesions, but research is ongoing to understand these better. Generally, a positive result for these can be trusted and it means you are infected; a negative result doesn’t necessarily mean you do not have mpox, as the amount of virus in these samples may be lower and therefore infections can be missed."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "What should I do if my test results are positive for mpox?", "answer": "If you have a positive test result for mpox, this means you have mpox. Your healthcare provider will advise you on next steps. Take precautions to protect others by following the WHO advice for recovering from mpox at home, if this is what is recommended to you. Isolation could also be in a health care facility until your lesions have crusted, the scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed underneath. This will help prevent anyone else from getting infected. Your healthcare provider will give you advice on how to take care of yourself. WHO’s public health advice for recovering from monkeypox at home provides some useful tips. If you have had close contact (including sex) with anyone in the 21 days before your symptoms started or you tested positive, if possible, you should tell them about your diagnosis so they can monitor for symptoms of mpox and get tested if necessary.  Healthcare providers may be able to pass on information to your previous contacts anonymously if you do not feel able to share the information yourself."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--individuals-and-communities", "question": "Do I have to tell other people that I have mpox?", "answer": "Your test results are private. Neither the laboratory nor your healthcare provider will tell anyone other than you and relevant public health authorities the results of your mpox test. You are not obliged to tell anyone what your results are. However, letting anyone who you have been in close contact with, after the onset of symptoms know that you have mpox, can help them monitor for symptoms and get tested if required. If it is safe for you to do without fear of stigma, discrimination or harm, then having open, non-judgmental conversations with people who you have been in close contact with since you developed symptoms can help curb transmission."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "Who should I test for mpox?", "answer": "WHO recommends that any individual meeting the definition for a “suspected case” of mpox should be offered testing. The case definition is outlined in the WHO mpox outbreak toolkit"}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "What tests are available?", "answer": "PCR is the reference standard for monkeypox virus detection. Other tests, including viral culture and serology, can be performed in some laboratories, but they are not recommended for routine diagnosis."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "When and how to provide testing or refer a patient for testing?", "answer": "Testing is highly recommended for all people with suspected mpox infection. Pathways for testing vary according to the country and health system."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "How do I make a diagnosis? Is one test enough?", "answer": "A single positive PCR test is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of mpox, and testing is highly recommended for all suspected cases. Where tests are unavailable, a clinical diagnosis might rely on a patient meeting the case definition of a “suspected case”. This would be either: On the basis of contact with a probable or confirmed mpox case in the 21 days before the onset of signs or symptoms, in a person who presents with any of the following: acute onset of fever (>38.5 °C), headache, myalgia (muscle pain/body aches), back pain, profound weakness or fatigue or On the basis of the presence of an unexplained acute skin rash (especially in locations typical for mpox), mucosal lesions or lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). However, care should be taken to differentiate mpox from other infections which may resemble mpox, including varicella zoster (shingles), herpes zoster, measles, herpes simplex, bacterial skin infections, disseminated gonococcal infection, primary or secondary syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale and molluscum contagiosum, among others. Testing for co-infection including for HIV and STIs should be considered as indicated and may be considered as routine clinical practice in sexual health services, and standard local guidance should be followed."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "How do I test a client without lesions?", "answer": "Patients may have known contact of a probable or confirmed case in the previous 21 days without showing lesions. Look for these symptoms: acute onset of fever (>38.5°C) headache proctitis/anal pain myalgia (muscle pain/body aches) back pain swollen lymph node profound weakness or fatigue If a combination of these symptoms present without visible lesions, consider testing them using an upper respiratory (oro/nasopharyngeal) swab or an anorectal swab, particularly if anal sex may have been the exposure route. However, the interpretation of results from oropharyngeal, anal and rectal swabs requires caution; while a positive result is indicative of mpox infection, a negative result is not enough to rule it out."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "How can I protect myself during specimen collection?", "answer": "To collect specimens in a safe and efficient manner, ensure you have received proper training and are familiar with the recommendations and guidelines regarding specimen collection. Interim guidance for laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus can be found here . Vigorous swabbing of lesions can be used as a first line method for specimen collection. The use of sharp instruments carries a risk of injury and contamination and should be avoided unless appropriate safety measures are in place. Before specimen collection, it is important to ensure that all appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) has been properly worn and fitted. In addition, it is important to communicate clearly to the patient what they should expect in terms of procedure but also discomfort. This will help avoid unexpected reactions. See WHO’s clinical and IPC guidance for mpox for more information. If available and appropriate, you can also consider getting vaccinated, as additional protection against infection."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "How do I encourage testing for someone who might have mpox?", "answer": "To help encourage testing, it is important to build and maintain trust with your communities and ensure that services are free from stigma and discrimination. It should be emphasized that testing for mpox is voluntary and just one part of a package of support which includes counselling, referral for medical care and social support where available. When individuals seek medical advice around mpox, equip them with adequate information by explaining clearly how testing works and what it entails. Understand that people may only come for testing if they have severe symptoms like pain and multiple lesions. Helping inform at-risk communities about mpox including signs, symptoms, and how it can be passed on to others through close contact can help encourage open conversations around risks and testing. Encourage your clients to raise awareness in their communities for people with symptoms and close contacts to seek health advice."}
{"topic": "/testing-for-mpox--health-workers", "question": "How do I counsel clients about their results and next steps based on results?", "answer": "A diagnosis of mpox can be distressing for clients, friends and family. Here are some considerations: Providing easy to understand information about home care and medical support services can be empowering for individuals. A positive test result should lead to referral for medical care and counselling services. Understanding what is available and how clients can access these services is important. Follow up is important especially for people recovering at home in isolation – ensure that clients are engaged with follow up contact and support. For negative test results it is also important to advise your client that it does not necessarily mean they are not infected. Provide them with information on how to monitor for symptoms and counsel them on retesting if appropriate."}
{"topic": "/road-traffic-injuries-children", "question": "Why are so many children involved in road traffic crashes?", "answer": "Children are at risk for road traffic injuries for a number of reasons. Younger children are limited by their physical, cognitive and social development, making them more vulnerable in road traffic than adults. Because of their small stature, it can be difficult for children to see surrounding traffic and for drivers and others to see them. In addition, if they are involved in a road traffic crash, their softer heads make them more susceptible to serious head injury than adults. Younger children may have difficulties interpreting various sights and sounds, which may impact on their judgement regarding the proximity, speed and direction of moving vehicles. Younger children may also be impulsive, and their short attention spans mean that they struggle to cope with more than one challenge at a time. As they grow older, children of adolescent age are especially prone to take risks, compromising their safety on the road. In general roads are planned without sufficient consideration of the specific needs of children. Road traffic injuries are the leading killer of children and young people aged 5–29 years worldwide. In addition, rates of road traffic death among children are typically 3 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Road traffic injuries can be prevented. While no single measure adequately addresses the vast range of risks to children on the road, the ten strategies below are those which are best known – especially when implemented as a package – to keep children safe on the road. controlling speed reducing drinking and driving using helmets for bicyclists and motorcyclists restraining children in vehicles improving children's ability to see and be seen enhancing road infrastructure adapting vehicle design implementing graduated driver licensing.

What are variants of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?", "answer": "It is usual for viruses to change and evolve as they spread between people over time. When these changes become significantly different to a previously detected virus, these new virus types are known as “variants.” To identify variants, scientists map the genetic material of viruses (known as sequencing) and then look for differences between them to see if they have changed. Since 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been spreading and changing globally. These changes have led to the detection of variants in many countries around the world. The more significant of these variants are grouped in three different ways – variants under monitoring, variants of interest and variants of concern."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-variants-of-sars-cov-2", "question": "2. What is the difference between variants under monitoring, variants of interest, and variants of concern?", "answer": "A Variant Under Monitoring (VUM) is a term used to signal to public health authorities that a SARS-CoV-2 variant may require prioritized attention and monitoring. The main objective of this category is to investigate if this variant (and others closely related to it) may pose an additional threat to global public health as compared to other circulating variants. the WHO variant tracking website. A Variant of Interest (VOI) is a term used to describe a SARS-CoV-2 variant with changes that are known to affect how the virus behaves or its potential impact on human health. This can include, for example, its ability to spread, its ability to cause serious disease, or how easily it may be detected or treated. A VOI may also be identified because it has an increased ability to spread when compared with other circulating variants, suggesting a potential emerging risk to global public health. A Variant of Concern (VOC) is a term that describes a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above), but also meets at least one of the following criteria when compared with other variants: it can cause a detrimental change in disease severity it can have a substantial impact on the ability of health systems to provide care to patients with COVID-19 or other illnesses and therefore require major public health interventions. there is a significant decrease in the effectiveness of available vaccines in protecting against severe disease.

How can we stop new variants from emerging?", "answer": "As with all viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, will continue to evolve as long as it continues to spread. The more that the virus spreads, the more pressure there is for the virus to change. So, the best way to prevent more variants from emerging is to stop the spread of the virus.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-variants-of-sars-cov-2", "question": "5. Do COVID-19 vaccines protect against newer virus variant?", "answer": "The COVID-19 vaccines with WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) or approval from stringent regulatory authorities (SRAs) provide different levels of protection against infection, mild disease, severe disease, hospitalization, and death, and are most effective against severe disease. Research is ongoing by thousands of scientists around the world to better understand how new virus mutations and variants affect the effectiveness of the different COVID-19 vaccines. Though current vaccines are less effective at protecting against infection and mild disease than they were for earlier virus variants; if you do get ill after being vaccinated, your symptoms are more likely to be mild. Remember that while the COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL or approved from SRAs are incredibly effective at reducing your risk of developing serious illness and death, no vaccine is 100% effective. This makes it very important to consider continuing to practice protective measures, even after being up to date with the COVID-19 vaccines as recommended by your country’s health authority.

WHO and ILO estimate that 1.6 billion workers around the world were occupationally exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation in 2019. This is almost one in three workers of working age (15 years or older). On average 0.3 deaths occurred per 100 000 working-age people (i.e., 15 years or older) and 8.0 DALYs per 100 000 in 2019. Occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation is estimated to have decreased by almost one-third between 2000 (41.9%) and 2019 (28.4%). Yet there has been an 88% increase in non-melanoma skin cancer deaths and a 77% increase in non-melanoma skin cancer DALYs attributed to occupational ultraviolet radiation between 2000-2019. This large increase is mainly driven by an overall increase non-melanoma skin cancer burden.

This evidence was based on a meta-analysis of 20 studies of over 88 448 participants covering three WHO regions. There was no evidence for differences in risk between regions, sexes or the non-melanoma skin cancer subtypes of basal and squamous cell carcinoma. The body of evidence regarding an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer among people occupationally exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation was judged to be of “moderate quality of evidence”.

A PAF quantifies the proportion of deaths or DALYs lost from a particular health outcome that is attributable to a specific risk factor, e.g., the proportion of deaths from stroke that can be attributed to exposure to long working hours. 10 The PAF for these estimates (i.e., the proportion of deaths from non-melanoma skin cancer that can be attributed to occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation) was produced using two key data sources: i) the proportion of the population who is occupationally exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation, and ii) the risk ratio for non-melanoma skin cancer among persons occupationally exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation compared with persons who were occupationally unexposed to this risk factor. The exposed population was modelled using 166 million observations from 763 official Labour Force Surveys collected by governments in 96 countries between 1996 and 2021. The risk ratio for the effect of occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation on non-melanoma skin cancer was sourced from the WHO/ILO systematic review and meta-analysis specifically conducted for this official estimation. 1 Additionally, the total numbers of deaths and of DALYs that are estimated to occur each year for the health outcome are needed, in this case the total numbers of deaths and of DALYs from non-melanoma skin cancer in 2000, 2010 and 2019. This is referred to as the “total disease envelope”. 11 WHO produces these envelopes from mortality records collected by governments in countries. 1"}

Medical masks are for single use only; discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin. Clean your hands after touching the mask. Be aware of the condition of the mask; replace it if it gets soiled or damp."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks", "question": "How should I wear and clean a fabric mask?", "answer": "How to put on and wear a fabric mask: Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Inspect the mask for tears or holes, do not use a mask that is damaged. Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides. Place the straps behind your head or ears. Do not cross the straps because this can cause gaps on the side of your face. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If you touch it, clean your hands. Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet. How to take off and store a fabric mask: Clean your hands before taking off the mask. Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask. If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day. Clean your hands after removing the mask. How to clean a fabric mask: Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees Centigrade/140 degrees Fahrenheit) at least once a day. If it is not possible to wash the mask in hot water, then wash it in soap/detergent and room temperature water, followed by boiling the mask for 1 minute. Watch our ‘How to wear a fabric mask’ video for a demonstration."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks", "question": "Should I wear a mask while exercising?", "answer": "Even when you’re in an area with active COVID-19 transmission, masks should not be worn during vigorous physical activity because of the risk of reducing your breathing capacity. No matter how intensely you exercise, keep at least 1 metre away from others,\r\n    and if you’re indoors, make sure there is adequate ventilation."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks", "question": "In health care facilities, when should medical masks be worn?", "answer": "If COVID-19 is widely circulating and impacting the health\r\nsystem, visitors, along with health and care workers and caregivers, should\r\nalways wear a well-fitting\r\nmedical mask in all common\r\nareas and when caring for non-COVID-19 patients. Health and care workers caring for COVID-19 patients should wear\r\na respirator or a medical mask. A mask may be required for inpatients if\r\nin close contact with a health and care worker, for example during examinations\r\nor bedside visits, and when the patient is outside of their care area when\r\nbeing transported."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks", "question": "What personal protective equipment (PPE) should health and care workers wear in the context of COVID-19?", "answer": "When caring for a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient, a respirator or a medical mask should be worn by health and care workers along with other personal protective equipment (PPE) – gown, gloves and eye protection. Factors for informing the choice in mask type may include a risk assessment and health and care workers’ values and preferences. Health and care workers may choose to wear a respirator in healthcare facilities where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained. A respirator should always be worn along with a gown, gloves, and eye protection by health and care workers performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) and on duty in settings where AGP are regularly performed on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, such as intensive care units, semi-intensive care units or emergency departments. Health and care workers must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their respirator or medical mask or face, before and after putting on and removing them, as well as before they touch them to readjust them.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks", "question": "What is the difference between medical masks and respirators, like N95?", "answer": "Health workers, caregivers and visitors must perform hand hygiene any time they touch their medical mask or face, before and after putting on and removing them, as well as before they touch them to readjust them. Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are: composed of 3 layers of synthetic nonwoven materials configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle available in different thicknesses have various levels of fluid-resistance and filtration. Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators – FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99, N100. Medical masks and respirator masks are similar in their filtration value. However, respirators also have a tight fit around the wearer face as the model and size of the respirator is specific to the wearer to ensure an adequate seal. Health and care workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size. Wearing a loose-fitting respirator will not offer the same level of protection to the wearer as it may allow small particles to get inside the mask where there are gaps, for example through the side."}
{"topic": "/mental-health-promoting-and-protecting-human-rights", "question": "What does ‘everyone has the right to mental health’ mean?", "answer": "Mental health is a basic human right for all people. Everyone, whoever and wherever they are, has a deserving and inherent right to the highest attainable standard of mental health. This includes: the right to available, accessible, acceptable and good quality care; and the right to liberty, independence and inclusion in the community. Having a mental health condition should never be a reason to deprive a person of their human rights or to exclude them from decisions about their own health. Unfortunately, people with mental health conditions around the world experience a wide range of human rights violations.  Many experience coercive practices including involuntary admission and treatment as well as seclusion and restraint. It is also common for people to be excluded from community life, discriminated against, denied basic rights such as food and shelter, and prohibited from voting or getting married. Many more cannot access the mental health care they need or can only access care that violates their human rights. In many places, lack of community based services means that the main setting for mental health care is long-stay psychiatric hospitals or institutions, which are often associated with human rights violations."}
{"topic": "/mental-health-promoting-and-protecting-human-rights", "question": "How can the human rights of people with mental health conditions be promoted? How can human rights violations be prevented?", "answer": "By ensuring laws and policies related to mental health are in line with internationally agreed human rights conventions. Countries should ensure their policies and laws related to mental health both protect and promote mental health. While many countries have sought to reform their laws, policies and services since the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, too few have adopted or amended the relevant laws and policies on the scale needed to end violations and promote the human right to mental health. Improve human rights in mental health services. Ways to assess and improve quality of care and human rights conditions should be established to protect against inhuman and degrading treatment, poor living conditions and involuntary admission and treatment. People should be able to file complaints in cases of human rights violations. Replace psychiatric institutions with community care. Large institutions, which are often associated with human rights violations, should be replaced by community mental health services , backed by care in general hospital and home care support. Mental health services need to link to services and supports in the community, enabling people living with mental health conditions to access educational, employment, social service and housing opportunities on an equal basis with others. Change attitudes and raise awareness. Ministries of Health, health professionals, civil society (in particular people with lived experience, organizations of persons with disabilities, and NGOs), academic institutions, professional organizations and other stakeholders should unify their efforts in educating and advocating for the rights of people with mental health conditions. Empower people with mental health conditions and their families. Governments should support creating and/or strengthening organizations of people with mental health conditions and as well as family organizations. These groups are in the best position to highlight problems, specify their needs, and help find solutions to prevent violations and improving mental health and other support services in countries. They have a crucial role to play in the design and implementation of policies, plans, laws and services. Increase investment in mental health. Governments need to dedicate more of their health budget to mental health. In addition, the mental health workforce at each level of the health care system needs to be developed and trained to ensure that all people have access to good quality mental health services that promote recovery and respect for human rights."}

{"topic": "/diphtheria", "question": "What is diphtheria?", "answer": "Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae .\r\n Signs and symptoms usually start 2 – 5 days after exposure and range \r\nfrom mild to severe. Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a \r\nsore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produce a poison \r\n(toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of \r\nthroat. This can block the airway making it hard to breathe or swallow \r\nand create a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to \r\nenlarged lymph nodes. The toxin may also get into the blood stream \r\ncausing complications that may include inflammation and damage of the \r\nheart muscle, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding \r\nproblems due to low blood platelets. The damaged heart muscles may \r\nresult in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may \r\nresult in paralysis."}
{"topic": "/diphtheria", "question": "How is diphtheria spread?", "answer": "Diphtheria spreads easily between people by direct contact \nor through the air though respiratory droplets, like from coughing or \nsneezing.  It may also be spread by contaminated clothing and objects."}
{"topic": "/diphtheria", "question": "How is diphtheria diagnosed?", "answer": "Clinical diagnosis of diphtheria usually relies on the presence of\n a greyish membrane covering the throat. Although laboratory \ninvestigation of suspected cases is recommended for case confirmation, \ntreatment should be started immediately."}
{"topic": "/diphtheria", "question": "How is diphtheria treated?", "answer": "Diphtheria infection is treated with the administration of a \r\ndiphtheria antitoxin, administered intravenously or through an \r\nintramuscular injection. Antibiotics are also given to eliminate the \r\nbacteria and stop toxin production, and to prevent transmission to others."}
{"topic": "/diphtheria", "question": "Are diphtheria vaccines recommended?", "answer": "All children worldwide should be immunized against diphtheria.\r\n A 3-dose primary series during infancy is the foundation for building \r\nlifelong immunity to diphtheria. Further, immunization programmes should\r\n ensure that 3 booster doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine are\r\n provided during childhood and adolescence. At any age those who are \r\nunvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated against diphtheria should \r\nreceive the doses necessary to complete their vaccination. Recent diphtheria outbreaks in several countries reflect \r\ninadequate vaccination coverage and have demonstrated the importance of \r\nsustaining high levels of coverage in childhood immunization programmes.\r\n Those who are unimmunized are at risk regardless of the setting. An \r\nestimated 84% of children worldwide receive the recommended 3 doses of \r\ndiphtheria-containing vaccine when they are infants, leaving 16% with no\r\n or incomplete coverage."}
{"topic": "/diphtheria", "question": "Do health-care workers need to take extra precautions?", "answer": "In endemic settings and outbreaks, health workers may be\r\nat greater risk of diphtheria than the general population. Consequently,\r\nspecial attention should be paid to immunizing health workers who\r\nmay have occupational exposure to Corynebacterium diphtheriae ."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "What is radiation and how are people exposed to it?", "answer": "Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or moving subatomic particles. Natural radiation comes from many naturally occurring radioactive materials found in soil, water, air and in the body. Every day, people inhale and ingest forms of radiation from air, food and water. Today, the most common artificial sources of human exposure to radiation are X-ray machines and radiopharmaceuticals used for diagnostic or radiotherapy and other medical devices. Exposure to radiation can result from natural sources (e.g. radon in homes), planned (medical, occupational) or accidental situations. Exposure may be external (with or without contamination of skin, hair, clothes), internal (inhalation, ingestion or  via a contaminated wound), or a combination of both."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "How does radiation affect my health?", "answer": "Excessive exposure to radiation may damage living tissues and organs, depending on the amount of radiation received (i.e. the dose). The extent of the potential damage depends on several factors, including: the type of radiation; the sensitivity of the affected tissues and organs; the route and duration of exposure; the radioactive isotopes involved; and the individual characteristics of the exposed person (such as age, gender and underlying health condition). The risk of developing adverse health effects depends on the radiation dose. The higher the dose, the higher the risk of adverse effects. If the radiation dose is low or is delivered over a long period of time, the risk is substantially lower because the damage to cells and molecules will be repaired by the body."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "What are the acute health effects of radiation exposure?", "answer": "At very high doses, radiation can impair the functioning of tissues and organs and produce acute effects such as nausea and vomiting, skin redness, hair loss, acute radiation syndrome, local radiation injuries (also known as radiation burns), or even death. In a radiological or nuclear emergency, first responders and the workers of the affected facility (e.g. nuclear power plant workers) are at a greater risk of being exposed to doses of radiation high enough to cause acute effects. The general population, however, is not likely to be exposed to doses high enough to cause the effects mentioned above. In the case of a radiation emergency, people should follow information from local authorities and comply with urgent protective actions to reduce their risk of exposure."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "How can I protect myself if I’m in an affected area?", "answer": "The three main principles to follow are to “Get in, Stay in and Tune in” in order to receive instructions. Always follow safety instructions from your local and national authorities and stay connected to receive the latest updates. If you have been instructed to stay inside, do so, as walls and ceilings can provide protection from radioactive fallout outside. If possible, stay in a room with no windows and external doors, and close windows and turn off ventilation systems (air conditioners or heaters) within your home."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "Are children at greater risk of being harmed from radiation exposure?", "answer": "Yes, children are more likely to develop adverse health effects from radiation exposure. Younger people's bodies are still growing and developing. As compared to adults, they have more cells that are dividing rapidly. Dividing cells are more sensitive to radiation and vulnerable to damage, which may lead to development of cancer in the future. Children also have a longer lifespan ahead of them, therefore there is more time for cancers to develop and manifest. It is especially important for children to follow instructions for protective measures and to seek medical attention after a radiation emergency as soon as emergency officials say it is safe to do so."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "What long-term effects can be expected from radiation exposure?", "answer": "Excessive exposure to doses of radiation can increase the risk of certain types of cancer developing in the long term. Radioactive iodine can be released during nuclear emergencies, which, if breathed in or swallowed, will concentrate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer in younger people (of 0-18 years). To reduce the risk of developing thyroid cancer, potassium iodide pills can be administered, but this should be done only when instructed by the local authorities."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "What is potassium iodide (KI)?", "answer": "Potassium iodide is a medication which, if taken at the right time and at the right dose, blocks radioactive iodine from entering the thyroid gland. This reduces the risk of thyroid cancer in persons aged 0-18 years, if they have been exposed to radioactive iodine."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "Will potassium iodide protect people from radiation in general?", "answer": "No. Potassium iodide only protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine exposure. Not every radiation emergency will have a release of radioactive iodine. The best ways to protect yourself are to follow three main actions: 1) get inside, 2) stay inside until it is safe to leave, and 3) tune in to available information channels and follow instructions from local and national authorities."}
{"topic": "/radiation-and-health", "question": "What is WHO's role in emergencies?", "answer": "WHO is committed to saving lives and reducing suffering during times of crisis – whether caused by conflict, disease outbreak or a disaster. The Organization works with Member States, international partners and other stakeholders so that the health sector is better prepared to respond to radiological and nuclear emergencies, radiation exposure is minimized, and patients with radiation injuries are rapidly managed.  . More specifically, WHO: supports the assessment of countries’ preparedness for radiation emergencies and      development of national plans to address critical capacity gaps; contributes to the development of strategies, policies and relevant national capacities      to respond to radiation emergencies; and monitors new and ongoing public health events to assess, communicate and recommend      action on public health risks related to potential radiological and      nuclear hazards. In addition, WHO works with countries and partners to: ensure readiness to reduce public health risks in the event of emergencies in      countries with high vulnerability; and provide life-saving health services to affected populations in countries with      ongoing emergencies."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "How can people be exposed to radioactivity in food?", "answer": "In normal situations, people are exposed to natural radiation sources as well as human-made sources daily. Every day, people inhale and ingest radionuclides from air, food and water. Most of these radionuclides are naturally present in our environment, but a minor proportion come from human-made sources related with medical and industrial applications of radiation. Additional radioactivity may be present in food if radioactive materials are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. Either falling from the air or carried in rainwater or snow, these radioactive materials can deposit on the surface of foods like vegetables or animal feed. Over time, radionuclides may be transferred through soil into crops or animals and build up within food. Radionuclides can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take them up."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "What are the potential health effects of consuming contaminated food?", "answer": "Consuming food contaminated with radionuclides in a nuclear or radiological emergency will increase the amount of radioactivity in the body and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The level of risk will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount of radioactivity that has been incorporated. For instance, if radioactive iodine is ingested with contaminated food or drink, or inhaled with contaminated air, it will accumulate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children. Radioactive iodine reduces its radioactivity in half (so called half-life) within 8 days and eventually stops being radioactive (decays) within few weeks. To prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid, stable iodine pills (KI pills) are used to saturate the thyroid so radioactive iodine will not accumulate (more information about iodine thyroid blocking at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550185 ). In contrast, radioactive isotope of caesium with half-life of 30 years will stay in the environment for many years. It is distributed in the whole body more homogeneously than iodine. Exposure to radioactive caesium can result in an increased risk of certain types of cancer, and this is also the case for some other radionuclides."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "Will all food production be affected by a radiological or nuclear emergency?", "answer": "No, not all foods will be affected. Radioactivity is unlikely to contaminate food that is packaged; for example, tinned or plastic-wrapped food is protected from radioactivity especially if the food is sealed. Food that was dispatched or commercially packaged before the emergency would not be affected. However, some food produced in areas where radioactive materials have been deposited may be contaminated and therefore food monitoring may support a risk analysis. When deemed necessary in light of a risk assessment, risk managers adopt evidence-based mitigation measures that help in keeping the dose of radionuclides ingested by populations as low as reasonably achievable."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "How can radioactivity be measured in food?", "answer": "Radioactive substances released due to a radiological or nuclear emergency can be measured in the environment using different detection methods. Very small amounts of radioactivity, such as those naturally present in food, might be identified using very sensitive detection techniques that are currently available. The sampling of food should target in priority the main potential contributors to radiation exposure based on their susceptibility to radioactive contamination and their significance in the diet of the general population and most vulnerable populations groups, such as the infant and young child, and women of childbearing age. It is important to bear in mind that the dietary exposure to radioactive material can increase as the result of either a high concentration or a high consumption of contaminated food, and therefore both aspects need consideration."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "What impact will this have on food and food production in the affected country?", "answer": "The impact on food and food production in a country affected by a radiological or nuclear emergency will depend upon the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited or present where food is being produced or harvested. Although the presence of radioactive iodine in food is of immediate concern after nuclear emergencies, it will not represent a problem for consumption in the long term due to its relatively short half-life and the fact that it will naturally decay over a short time frame. In contrast, radioactive caesium can linger in the environment for many years and could continue to present a long term problem for food production and trade, and a threat to human health."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "Can food be contaminated in areas beyond the most critical zone (evacuation zone)?", "answer": "During a nuclear emergency, an evacuation zone is established to prevent people from being exposed to immediate and unacceptable levels of radiation posing a threat to human health. However, the release of radioactivity into the environment may result in contamination of food chains and potentially cause contamination of food beyond this most critical zone through uptake from soil to crops, or to animals through feed, even when levels of radioactive contamination are lower than those which might pose a direct threat to human health. The acceptable amount of radioactivity in food is set at low levels by the regulatory authorities, taking into account the possibility of contaminated food being eaten over an extended period and resulting in a cumulative dose."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for trade?", "answer": "There are internationally agreed standards for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. The Codex Guideline Levels (GLs), published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, are provided for adult and infant foods. The GLs state, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding GL, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption.” When the GLs are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the GLs may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small contribution to the total dose, the GLs may be increased by a factor of 10. GLs for radionuclide levels in food can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – ( CODEX STAN 193-1995 ). More information about international standards on radioactivity in food and drinking-water is available at: Criteria for radionuclide activity concentrations for food and drinking-water (2016) - (TECDOC 1788), Management of radioactivity in drinking-water (2018)."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "What actions can be taken to monitor the safety of food following a radiological or nuclear emergency?", "answer": "In response to a radiological or nuclear emergency, the national authorities should implement monitoring of food products and restrict the consumption and distribution of some products in certain areas if the amount of radionuclides they contain exceed levels consider acceptable in local regulations, and in accordance to international standards. It is advisable that the relevant authorities provide information about their food monitoring findings and decisions related to the consumption and distribution of food. In addition to the above mentioned Codex standards for traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency, criteria on radioactivity concentration in food have been also internationally agreed for countries where a radiological emergency occurred. They are available at: IAEA (2011). Criteria for use in preparedness and response for a nuclear or radiological emergency. IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GSG-2. Cosponsored by FAO, IAEA, ILO, PAHO and WHO. Vienna: International Atomic Energy Agency ( http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1467_web.pdf ); and IAEA (2015) Preparedness and response for a nuclear or radiological emergency.

Other countries can implement food control measures such as requiring documentation to verify the safety of products or the area of origin of the food. Other countries may decide to suspend food imports from the affected area or increase monitoring on foods imported from that area by measuring radioactive activity at the port of entry."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "What general advice can be given to food consumers and producers in the event of a nuclear emergency?", "answer": "The response to a radiological or nuclear emergency is similar to the response to any other emergency involving hazardous material contaminating food. In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the radioactive contamination of food. For example, it is possible to: protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins; close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables; bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn; harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; and not harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded. Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as: avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables; avoid slaughtering animals; avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); and avoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods. Food that was packaged and sealed before the incident, such as tinned or plastic-wrapped, is safe for consumption."}
{"topic": "/radioactivity-in-food-after-a-nuclear-emergency", "question": "Considerations for breastfeeding women", "answer": "Due to the known higher sensitivity of children to radiation, radiation emergencies resulting in releases of radioactive substances to the environment may understandably cause fear among nursing mothers about the potential transfer of radioactivity with breastmilk to their babies. However, this transfer might only be of concern in extreme situations, like for local populations near the area most affected by a radioactive release. The concern would be mainly limited to situations with large releases of radioactive iodine, as the risk of thyroid cancer for breastfed infants would be higher than to their mothers. Thyroid blocking by oral administration of stable iodine (together with control of food and drinking-water) is an important protective action when radioactive iodine may be released in large quantities. Children, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women are most likely to benefit from iodine thyroid blocking. The national and local authorities will provide advice on the practical implementation of these and other public health protective measures."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-small-public-gatherings", "question": "I am planning to attend a wedding and a party. What precautions should I take to protect myself and others from getting infected with COVID-19?", "answer": "While we are in a much better situation than we were in 2020, COVID-19 is still around and the virus is circulating in all countries. Population immunity from vaccination and past infection(s) are providing protection from developing severe disease and death. As such, in the fourth year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no zero risk when it comes to any kind of gathering – especially events that bring groups of people together. Regardless of the size of the event, you are at risk from COVID-19 whenever you get together in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated settings. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads through the air between people, often when in close proximity to another person and more easily indoors, especially in poorly ventilated settings. If you feel unwell or show any symptoms of COVID-19 , get tested. If the test is positive, stay at home. If you choose to attend a gathering, ensure you keep following these personal protective measures: wear a well-fitting mask and keep a safe distance from others, as feasible avoid crowds and keep indoor spaces well-ventilated; always practice respiratory etiquette by covering coughs and sneezes; clean your hands regularly; stay up to date with vaccinations; stay home if you are sick; consider self-testing with a rapid test before attending the event, as you could be infected without showing symptoms; and get tested if you have symptoms or you’ve been exposed to COVID-19. These measures are a good idea to protect yourself and others, even when the event or venue doesn’t require you to practice them."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-small-public-gatherings", "question": "I am organizing a gathering for family and friends. What steps can I take to make the event as safe as possible for my guests?", "answer": "Organizers and attendees of any gathering should always take caution, regardless of the size and type of the event and whether they are planned or spontaneous. This applies to private or community celebrations, sports matches, religious gatherings, etc. If you are hosting an event, consider using an outdoor space. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily indoors, especially in poorly ventilated settings. Outdoor venues are safer than indoor spaces. Make your event as safe as possible for guests and ensure good ventilation if the event is held indoors. Make sure to thoroughly clean the area where the gathering is held. This is important for COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases. Help your guests follow COVID-19 basic prevention measures: provide masks, options for hand hygiene including alcohol-based hand sanitizer or access to soap and water and encourage respiratory etiquette (covering the mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when they cough or sneeze). Continue to encourage event attendees to take personal protective measures such as staying home when sick, seeking medical advice if at risk of severe disease, wearing a well-fitting mask and keeping a distance, as feasible, practicing respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene and staying up to date with vaccinations. As always, follow guidance issued by local public health authorities before you plan a gathering."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "Should I travel?", "answer": "Travelling, especially in crowded places, can increase the risk of exposure to infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Always take precautions if you’re in a high-risk group. People in high-risk groups (for example, people with diabetes, heart or lung disease, cancer, immunosuppression, history of stroke and/or asthma or people who are 60 years or older) are at an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. While the emergency of COVID-19 is over, COVID-19 is not, and the virus is circulating in all countries. It’s important to know your health status and what this means for you in terms of the risks of COVID-19 when planning for travel. There may also be rules and precautions for COVID-19 while you’re travelling and at both where your trip originates and where you are going. Always, follow travel advisories issued by both the country of origin and of destination."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "What precautions should I take during travel?", "answer": "To reduce your risk of getting seriously ill or dying, ensure that you are fully vaccinated prior to your trip and according to your country’s recommendations, including getting any booster doses if applicable. Throughout your travel, you may be in areas that are closed, confined, or crowded, which puts you at a higher risk of being exposed to COVID-19. For example, you may be in crowded airports or on public transportation to or from an airport.  It is important that you assess your risk of COVID-19 and follow these simple prevention measures throughout your travel: wear a well-fitting mask and keep a safe distance from others, as feasible avoid crowds as much as possible always practice respiratory etiquette by covering coughs and sneezes clean your hands regularly stay up to date with your vaccinations stay home if you are sick and consider not travelling get tested if you have symptoms or if you’ve been exposed to COVID-19. Be sure to follow COVID-19 travel policies and rules required by venues, transport operators and travel hubs such as airports, bus terminals and train stations. Get informed before travelling."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "What is meant by “essential travel”?", "answer": "As part of public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, many national authorities limited travel at different stages of the pandemic or restricted to essential travels. These restrictions have now been lifted in many countries. Essential travel is defined differently by national authorities in different countries. Essential travel may include travel for emergencies and humanitarian activities (including emergency medical flights and medical evacuation) and travel taken by essential personnel (including emergency responders and those who provide public health technical support, and critical personnel in transport and security sectors, such as seafarers and diplomatic officers). Essential travel may also include repatriations to home countries, as well as cargo transport needed to deliver essential supplies such as food, medicines and fuel. WHO encourages national authorities to facilitate travel for essential reasons at all times."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "The travel company is asking me to wear a mask while traveling. Which kind of mask should I use?", "answer": "All travellers should continue adhering to preventive measures such as mask use, keeping a safe distance from others, and avoiding crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated areas as much as possible. For more information on the kind of mask to use, see As the questions and answers on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Masks ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "Should I get a vaccine or immunity certificate before travelling?", "answer": "Getting vaccinated could save your life. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization, and death. Most countries have lifted all requirements for travel related to COVID-19.  A few countries still continue exempting travellers who have been fully vaccinated or have proof of recent SARS-CoV-2 status from certain requirements (mainly testing prior to travel or on arrival). Before you travel, make sure you know the requirements and policies in place where your trip originates and at your destination, and abide by them."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "Could I be screened when I exit or arrive at my destination?", "answer": "Yes, while this may have changed in many places, you may still be screened when entering or leaving a venue, destination or country. Be sure to know what is required or expected as you plan your travel. Exit and entry screening may include measures such as interviews, checking temperatures and evaluation of symptoms – including respiratory symptoms, fever, cough or shortness of breath. You may also be asked to provide information about any possible recent exposure you have had to people with COVID-19 symptoms or confirmed diagnoses."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "Should I use a digital contact tracing app while traveling?", "answer": "In many countries and regions, public health and social measures, including contract tracing, are no longer in force. However, some venues, destinations and countries may request or require that you download and register with a digital contact tracing app. Where this is applicable, these apps collect information to identify and inform travellers who may have been in contact with a person who has been confirmed to have COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "Should I get a COVID-19 test before departure or upon arrival?", "answer": "Many countries do not require proof of a COVID-19 test result. However, some venues, destinations and countries may still require COVID-19 tests prior to departure or upon arrival as part of their strategies to prevent the spread of disease or surge. COVID-19 tests conducted immediately prior to departure or on arrival are used in an effort to determine the health status of travellers; reduce the likelihood of importing the virus; and/or as a means to detect potential new variants of concern among incoming travellers. Every destination has its own policies, so it’s important to be aware of testing requirements before you hit the road."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?", "answer": "Most airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filters, which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potentially infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50% outside air and 50% filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.  However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Other important measures include wearing a mask, keeping a safe distance whenever possible, and regular hand hygiene."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-travel-advice-for-the-general-public", "question": "What should I do if I get sick while traveling?", "answer": "Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement. If you become ill during your travel, consider wearing a mask continuously while you travel, regularly clean your hands with hand sanitizer, cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance from others wherever possible. If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 while you travel or when you arrive at your destination, follow the guidance provided by health authorities. You may be required to quarantine or isolate yourself in accordance with your destination country’s policy.  Your travel companions may also be required to quarantine, since they have been in contact with you. If you become ill during your travel, inform your travel attendant."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings", "question": "How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?", "answer": "Mass gathering (MG) events can range in size and profile. For example, high-profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cup and international religious events such as the Hajj are all well-known mass gatherings. However, smaller events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. WHO defines mass gatherings as events characterized by the concentration of people at a specific location for a specific purpose over a set period of time and which has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the country or community. Any event can count as a mass gathering if the number of people it brings together can strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. There is no defined threshold qualifying an event as a mass gathering based on the number of attendees alone. However, generally speaking, we can say that the risk associated with an event grows if, for example, the event takes place over several days, or if the event takes place in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is limited."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings", "question": "What does WHO recommend to have in place for a mass gathering event?", "answer": "WHO continues to recommend that the decision-making process related to holding, modifying, postponing, or cancelling gatherings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should rely on a risk-based approach focused on the evaluation, mitigation and communication of risk. This assessment should involve all relevant stakeholders, including the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place in consultation with event organizers. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress an event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. The risk-based approach is flexible and adaptable to all SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios. It can be applied to gatherings of any size and type, whether they are large and highly visible events or smaller ones, formal or informal, planned or spontaneous. Many countries are currently easing restrictions or have no restrictions on gatherings of different sizes. Nevertheless, even where an event is determined safe to proceed, it is recommended that large gatherings apply a risk-based approach prior to the event.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings", "question": "What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing risks associated with mass gatherings?", "answer": "There are three main steps that event organizers and health authorities should consider when assessing risks associated with mass gatherings: assessment of risk factors of the mass gathering event, including COVID-19 and other risks; designing of mitigation measures to be implemented to reduce the risk associated with the mass gathering event; and communicating the risks associated with the event with staff, participants and the general public, and providing considerations for the event's risk communication and community engagement strategy. These three steps together will help guide a decision to restrict, modify, postpone, cancel or proceed with holding any gathering . For public gatherings, this kind of risk assessment should be undertaken by local and national public health authorities and event organizers. Large public events are often associated with international travel, multiple venues, prolonged duration and extensive media and social media interest. They can have significant reputational, political, economic and societal implications. These mass gatherings carry with them additional risks, as the spread of COVID-19 or other diseases during or after they are held can strain the planning and response resources of the host country or community, and lead to disruptive impacts on health services. The potential for disruption associated with mass gatherings is also dependent on the following factors. Epidemiological factors: The current epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the host area including the proportion of COVID-19 positive tests (of the total test performed in a given time and place), any ongoing spikes of disease transmission in the host area and from where most of the event attendees come from. Importantly, with the increasing self-testing and the use of rapid diagnostic test kits, the available information about the number of cases should be interpreted carefully. Individual factors: The geographical spread and number of participants, and their individual risk perception, practice of protective behaviours, status of vaccination or natural infection, and risk profile – such as being older adults, having underlying health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) or being a healthcare worker – may increase the risk profile of an individual for COVID-19. Additional factors such as none to mild symptoms may affect individual behaviours in accessing to healthcare and receiving the diagnosis. Health system factors: Current implementation of public health and social measures (PHSM) in place to help reduce infections of SARS-CoV-2 and the capacity of the local health system to respond to increased health burdens. Venue factors: The context of mass gathering, and the characteristics of its venue(s) should be considered. For example, a mass gathering held outdoors with good ventilation may have different risk profile characteristics than one held in an indoor area with poor ventilation.

Additionally, a MG Risk Assessment web app tool for event organizers, health authorities and other stakeholders involved in the planning of MGs can be found here ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings", "question": "Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)?", "answer": "No. However, event organizers should prioritize and promote an individual risk-based approach where eventgoers can individually assess their risk factors for COVID-19. Similarly, event organizers should provide travellers and eventgoers with information and visible reminders to encourage protective behaviours and adherence to PHSMs. The individual-based approach is important because some people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not have symptoms but can still transmit the virus.  Syndromic screening, which includes screening for fever and respiratory or other symptoms, as well as visual observation and completion of health declaration forms, may not detect COVID-19 infections among pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people. Additionally, infected individuals with fever who use drugs that reduce symptoms may not be detected via temperature screening. https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331512/WHO-2019-nCoV-POEmgmt-2020.2-eng.pdf"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings", "question": "Should event organizers provide COVID-19 testing?", "answer": "The decision to conduct COVID-19 testing at a mass gathering event should continue to be monitored and not be limited to specific populations (e.g., only those in urban settings with high access to testing or travellers).  At this time, WHO continues to recommend that decision-making related to gatherings follow a risk-based approach in collaboration with authorities and event organizers. It is recommended that anyone who is feeling unwell or is symptomatic should stay at home and refrain from participating in or attending an event."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-mass-gatherings", "question": "Are there additional safeguards event organizers can implement or recommend to athletes/officials/visitors in the context of COVID-19?", "answer": "Event organizers should provide the current general guidance to all potential participants or visitors to a mass gathering or event. WHO continues to recommend these measures: wear a well-fitting mask and keep a safe distance from others, as feasible avoid crowds and keep indoor spaces well-ventilated always practice respiratory etiquette by covering coughs and sneezes clean your hands regularly stay up to date with vaccinations stay home if you are sick get tested if you have symptoms or you’ve been exposed to COVID-19. Clear information should be provided to the public about what to do if someone is unwell and whom to contact for advice, testing and/or treatment. Organizers should always implement precautionary measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread, regardless of the calculated event risk. This includes developing a comprehensive risk communication and community engagement strategy to inform attendees about associated risks and necessary precautions. Regular reassessment of measures based on the COVID-19 situational level framework should be conducted, with adherence monitored through assessments like mobility data and community surveys. Personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and mask usage, should be followed, and clear guidance provided on seeking advice, testing, and treatment when unwell. In the event of a new variant of concern, implementing higher-level of PHSM as a precautionary measure may be necessary until it is fully characterized."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 or develop more severe COVID-19?", "answer": "People living with HIV (PLHIV) who have not achieved viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment (ART) may have a compromised immune system that leaves them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and further HIV disease progression. There is no clinical evidence that PLHIV have a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when compared with HIV-negative people. There are several small studies conducted early in the pandemic that describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in PLHIV, indicating that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 is similar in people with and without HIV, particularly if they are on ART and have achieved HIV viral suppression However, global data compiled by WHO from almost 350 000 patients in 38 countries indicate that PLHIV are at increased risk for development of severe illness and death due to COVID-19. This analysis found that the risk of developing severe fatal COVID-19 was 38% greater in this population when compared to people without HIV infection (1) . PLHIV frequently face adverse social determinants of health and structural factors that may lead to higher SARS-CoV-2 exposure. They also have a high prevalence of some comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension. Additionally, lower CD4 T-cell counts are associated with advanced HIV disease and several epidemiological studies are suggesting that this HIV subpopulation are at greater risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 and mortality. Taken all these considerations together, there is no clear evidence of a higher risk for PLHIV to be infected with SARS-COV-2 when compared with the general population. However, those with advanced HIV disease, those with low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral load and those who are not taking ART have an increased risk of COVID-19 complications in general."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Should the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 be different in people living with HIV?", "answer": "Current recommendations for COVID-19 clinical management in people living with HIV generally do not differ from those of the general population, including treatment and prevention measures. PLHIV are as eligible to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies as people without HIV infection and those individuals with advanced HIV disease should be considered as a high priority. When starting treatment for COVID-19 in patients with HIV, clinicians should pay careful attention to potential interactions between drugs and overlapping toxicities among COVID-19 treatments, antiretrovirals (ARV), antimicrobial therapies, and other medications. PLHIV who develop COVID-19 should continue their ARV regimen, opportunistic infection treatment and prophylaxis whenever possible. The ARV regimen should not be switched or adjusted (i.e., by adding ARV drugs to the regimen) for the purpose of preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals who know their HIV status are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as the general population (e.g., wash hands often, practice cough hygiene, avoid touching your face, social distancing, seek medical care if symptomatic, self-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions recommended in the government’s response). PLHIV who are taking ARV drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days of ARVs, if not a 3- to 6-month supply. It is also an important opportunity to ensure that all PLHIV who are not yet on antiretroviral treatment begin to do so.  People who feel they may have been at HIV risk are advised to seek testing to protect against HIV disease progression and complications from any other health issues."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19 or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection?", "answer": "No ARVs are currently recommended by WHO to treat or prevent COVID-19. Initial in vitro, animal and small human observational studies conducted during previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) and in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested that some ARVs, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), could help against SARS-CoV-2 and should be repurposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This hypothesis was subsequently assessed in further observational studies and in large randomized controlled trials, but no clinical benefit or impact on disease severity or mortality were demonstrated (2) . Several observational studies also indicated that use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) could be associated with lower risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19. However, these studies had limitations and may have been influenced by other health issues in the participants.. Subsequent larger observational studies and clinical trials have not found a relationship between TDF or TAF and risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or severe outcomes. While the evidence of benefit of using ARVs to treat coronavirus infections was not demonstrated, serious side effects from these drugs were not rare. The routine use of LPV/r and TDF or TAF as part of treatment regimens for HIV can be associated with several side effects of moderate severity. Therefore, at this time there is no evidence to suggest that any particular ARV agent improves or worsens COVID-19 clinical outcomes in PLHIV, or can be used for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. WHO recommends maintaining the standard approaches to initiation and continuation of ART in PLHIV, with a focus on reducing HIV-associated immune compromise and achievement of virologic suppression. The same principles are applicable for use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) or post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens for HIV prevention."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Can COVID-19 infection affect HIV test results?", "answer": "Recent research suggests that some people have had false reactive HIV test results when they had COVID-19 (3, 4). These studies evaluated individuals using a 4th generation serology HIV assays. Over the past 4 decades, cross-reactivity due to viral or bacterial infections has been reported with serology HIV assays. To prevent misdiagnosis, WHO recommends HIV be diagnosed through a multi-assay 3 test strategy ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for people living with HIV?", "answer": "Many of the initial clinical studies with COVID-19 vaccines have included a small number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in their trials. Despite limited data, available information from those studies suggests that current WHO recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe for PLHIV. The currently available COVID-19 vaccine products are not live vaccines but\r\n    include modified viral proteins or genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 which cannot replicate or cause changes to human genes. More recent observational studies have further evaluated the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in this population and didn’t\r\n    find any evidence of a higher rate of unusual side effects after vaccination when compared with general population. In addition, no pharmacological interactions have been reported between COVID-19 vaccines and antiretroviral medications (ARV) which\r\n    PLHIV should continue to take after vaccination to maintain health. Recently, a debate in the scientific community has led to broader concerns about a potential association observed more than a decade ago between adenovirus vector-based vaccines and an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection among men who received this\r\n    type of vaccine. This unexpected finding was detected in two HIV vaccine trials that used adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector containing products (5, 6) . The reason for this observed increase in the HIV acquisition risk remains uncertain, although\r\n    several hypothetical mechanisms have suggested a possible interference in the HIV specific vaccine response or in the CD4 T-cell susceptibility to HIV infection induced by pre-existing adenovirus- associated immunity in combination with other factors. \r\n    However, a third study also using Ad5 vector-based HIV vaccine has not reported this finding (7) . Despite\r\nthese potential concerns, it is important to highlight that the benefits of all authorized COVID-19 vaccines in a pandemic context largely outweigh this potential risk. The theoretical concern on increased risk of HIV acquisition is confined to a specific\r\nAd5 vectored HIV vaccine and should not be extended to other vaccine platforms. However, as several COVID-19 vaccines are using human and animal adenovirus vector platforms, specific studies are encouraged to better assess the safety of Ad5 vectored COVID-19\r\nvaccines in sub-populations at high risk of HIV acquisition. An extended follow-up from a Phase III study of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is currently evaluating HIV seroconversion rates in the participants, and interim results are expected in the\r\nend of 2022. Global data have shown that PLHIV have a 38% greater risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19 compared to people without HIV infection (8) . For this reason, it is important to prioritize PLHIV to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. People with stable HIV disease\r\n    have been now included in several COVID-19 vaccine trials, and specific cohort studies on COVID-19 vaccines with PLHIV has been recently rolled out. Therefore, more information on this topic specific to PLHIV is expected in the future. WHO will continue\r\n    to monitor the situation as new data become available and SAGE recommendations will\r\n be updated accordingly."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Do COVID-19 vaccines provide protection for people living with HIV?", "answer": "Current available studies on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in PLHIV with high CD4 T-cell counts and using ART, indicate that most of these individuals produce antibody levels and cellular immune response in the same range observed in people without\r\n    HIV infection, suggesting that current recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe and protective in this population. However, there is data in these studies from individuals with low CD4 T-cell counts (i.e., below 200 cells/mm3) or without HIV viral suppression that show a reduced immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, the antibody responses after vaccination may dwindle faster than people with higher CD4 T-cell counts. This reduced immune response to COVID-19 vaccines has also been reported in individuals with other causes of severe immunodeficiency (e.g., solid and hematologic malignancies, people with organ transplants and in hemodialysis). Suboptimal immune response against certain vaccine preventable diseases has also been demonstrated in people with advanced HIV disease and/or lower CD4 T-cell counts. Higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary vaccination (i.e., breakthrough infections) among PLHIV when compared with people without HIV have been described. A population-level analysis conducted in immunocompromised patients indicated a 33% higher incidence rate of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections among PLHIV, albeit without accounting for HIV-specific factors (10) . Additionally, a large HIV cohort study with more than 100 000 individuals vaccinated and with good HIV control showed a low overall (3.8%) but 28% higher risk of breakthrough infection without association with HIV viral load or CD4 T-cell counts. The breakthrough rate was also higher in people with vs without HIV (55 cases per 1000 person-years vs 43 cases per 1000 person-years) (11) . These higher rates and risk of breakthrough infections observed in PLHIV when compared with the general population should not be a reason to postpone or to avoid COVID-19 vaccines in these patients, who have a higher risk of COVID-19 complications and death. It supports the recommendation for the use of additional primary doses in this population as in other immunocompromised groups. Furthermore, national COVID-19 immunization programmes should not exclude people from key and vulnerable populations at risk of HIV, who frequently have limited access to health services. WHO will continue to monitor emerging evidence and will provide timely guidance updates."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Should people living with HIV get vaccines early in the roll out?", "answer": "WHO currently recommends that PLHIV should be included as a priority population for COVID-19 immunization. It has been supported by growing evidence suggesting that PLHIV, particularly those with advanced HIV disease, lower CD4 T-cell count, or non-suppressed viral load appear to be at increased risk of poor outcomes and death due to COVID-19 when compared with people without HIV infection (12) . Furthermore, many PLHIV have 1 or more chronic comorbidities that may put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death, independent from their HIV disease or immune status. Therefore, PLHIV, particularly those with co-morbidities (such chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, motor neurone or Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, severe obesity) should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. Many countries have included PLHIV as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination according to their epidemiological context, prioritizing vaccination for all PLHIV or those who are immunocompromised (as indicated by having a CD4 T-cell count <200/mm3) (13) . In mid-2021, according an informal WHO poll survey conducted with more than 100 countries from all regions, more than 40 have established a COVID-19 immunization policy that prioritizes vaccinations for PLHIV. However, the real coverage of COVID-19 vaccination among PLHIV in countries varies widely. A regional survey conducted at the end of 2021 in central and eastern Europe found that PLHIV had been prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination in 8 of the 22 countries and only 3 countries had formulated guidelines for the vaccination of PLHIV (14) . A recent study conducted in New York State, USA, found that COVID-19 vaccination coverage among PLHIV was lower than that in the general adult population (63.5% vs 75.0%) (15) . Differences in demographic composition between PLHIV and the general population might partly explain lower coverage; however, coverage was 75% lower across all examined PLHIV subgroups. Unmeasured structural factors, including socioeconomic status, might further explain the lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage among this group. As countries are in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout and have different demographic structure, they should also refer to the WHO SAGE Roadmap for Prioritizing Uses of COVID-19 Vaccines for operational details."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "Should all people living with HIV receive additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine?", "answer": "Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective in most PLHIV, with significant reduction in the risk of severe COVID-19 disease or death when the standard regimen (currently 1 or 2 doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) is fully taken as recommended. However, there is a growing evidence of a suboptimal immune response to the standard course of COVID-19 vaccination in people with moderate to severe immunodeficiency, including those with advanced HIV disease, lower CD4 T-cell counts, or unsuppressed viral load. Therefore, in people with moderate to severe advanced HIV disease , an additional vaccine dose should be administered as part of the extended primary series and should be given 1–3 months after the completion of the primary series to enhance the immune response and increase protection. This approach is recommended by WHO as well as several other major COVID-19 guidelines . A gradual reduction of vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been observed after the completion of primary COVID-19 vaccine series, even in those individuals without clinical immunodeficiency and with good initial response to the primary vaccine course. Many countries are now recommending the administration of an additional vaccine dose as a booster in all individuals, including PLHIV who are asymptomatic or mild clinical immunodeficiency and CD4 counts above 200 T-cells/mm3 and virologically suppressed. This booster dose can be taken 4 to 6 months after the completion of the primary vaccination series . The objective of the booster doses strategy is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient. Some countries are implementing a second booster dose for their highest risk populations, including people with moderate to severe advanced HIV disease, 3–5 months after an initial booster dose . More data on the waning of protective immunity and vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and hospitalization after an initial booster dose is required before WHO endorsed recommendation on the additional booster dose. According to the WHO SAGE roadmap, the highest priority continues to be ensuring that all PLHIV receive their primary vaccine series against COVID-19, complemented by an additional dose in those with advanced HIV disease . Risk of development of immune escape variants in immunosuppressed patients People with moderate to severe immunodeficiency have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 and suffering from a long-term persistent infection with prolonged viral shedding due to suboptimal immune response. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., facial mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (e.g., additional vaccine doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination. This situation can create an environment for immune escape and selection of evolutionary variants. Several case reports indicated that multi-mutational SARS-CoV-2 variants can arise during such persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals and could result in novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The findings that immunocompromised patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection may generate new SARS-CoV-2 variants have several medical and public health implications. Heightened precautions should be taken to avert nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among immunocompromised patients. Such patients should be prioritized for anti-COVID-19 immunization not only to protect them but also to mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "What is WHO’s position on clinical trials/research while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing?", "answer": "WHO is providing support and direction to the scientific community and welcomes the research and development of effective tests, vaccines, medicines and other interventions for COVID-19. For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development, including for clinical trials of new drugs and vaccines. The WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19 , initiated on 7 January 2020, will serve as the global\r\n    strategy for research and development activities. Its aim is to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large scale crises. As part of this, WHO is leading the global prioritization\r\n    of candidate vaccines and therapeutics for development and evaluation. To support testing, WHO convened a scientific advisory group to develop guidance on trial designs for experimental vaccines and therapeutics. WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials for existing antivirals and other medicines that are being conducted for COVID-19. WHO continues to emphasize that all clinical trials should and must follow stringent ethical and regulatory standards.\r\n    Regulatory authorities have a role to play to ensure close oversight of all clinical trials that will be undertaken. PLHIV should be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials that are evaluating agents for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-covid-19-and-people-living-with-hiv", "question": "What can WHO and the world do to support people living with HIV to live a healthy life?", "answer": "While WHO is working with countries to ensure fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to continue actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Alongside the response to COVID-19, it is critical to maintain access to essential health services. This includes: supporting PLHIV to continue taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adapting services to make this easier and more efficient during the COVID-19 response; continuing to provide HIV prevention and testing services with linkage to ART initiation as a priority; ensuring those who start ART can remain on it to reduce health risks and complications during COVID-19. This must be classified as an essential service , together with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of co-morbidities and co-infections ; and monitoring all PLHIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially those with advanced HIV disease or with co-morbidities. Although there may be an increase in the risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19 among PLHIV, making sure that people have access to effective ART and other health care services they need will help minimize this risk.

Basically, when we say super gonorrhoea we mean a gonorrhoea ‘superbug’. These are extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea with high-level resistance to the current recommended treatment\r\n    for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone and azithromycin), including resistance to penicillin, sulphonamides, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. The gonorrhoea superbug was previously reported by several countries including France, Japan and Spain,\r\n    and in 2020 also in Australia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."}
{"topic": "/what-s-super-about-super-gonorrhea-a-q-a-with-who-s-dr.-teodora-wi", "question": "What is the current situation of gonorrhoea and resistance to current treatment to gonorrhoea?", "answer": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the second most common bacterial STI and results in substantial morbidity and a huge economic cost worldwide. WHO estimates that in 2020, 82.4 million new cases occurred among adolescents and adults aged 15–49 years worldwide with a global incident rate of 19 (11–29) per 1000 women and 23 (10–43) per 1000 men. Most cases were in the WHO African and Western Pacific Regions. AMR in gonorrhoea appeared shortly after the introduction of antimicrobials at the beginning of the 20th century. Resistance has continued to expand since then. In countries where appropriate and quality assured surveillance is in place, there are rising trends in decreased susceptibility and increased resistance in N. gonorrhoeae to the last line of antibiotics (cefixime and ceftriaxone)."}
{"topic": "/what-s-super-about-super-gonorrhea-a-q-a-with-who-s-dr.-teodora-wi", "question": "What causes resistant gonorrhoea?", "answer": "There are 5 reasons for the rise of resistant gonorrhoea. unrestricted access to antimicrobials; inappropriate selection and overuse of antibiotics; suboptimal quality of antibiotics; inherent genetic mutations within the organism which have contributed to the development of a pattern of resistance in N. gonorrhoeae ; and extra\r\n genital infections – anorectal and pharyngeal – particularly affect key\r\n populations such as men who have sex with men. This may also play an \r\nimportant role in the development of resistant strains as N. gonorrhoeae interacts and exchanges genetic material with other co-infections in these anatomical sites. Added challenges are that most infections in the pharynx are asymptomatic, and that antimicrobial drugs do not penetrate the tissue well in that area."}
{"topic": "/what-s-super-about-super-gonorrhea-a-q-a-with-who-s-dr.-teodora-wi", "question": "As levels of AMR and resistant infections are on the rise globally, should we expect to see an increase in resistance to other STIs? Is it possible that we will have ‘super’ syphilis or ‘super’ chlamydia in the near future?", "answer": "Yes, there are risks that resistance could \r\nbe seen in other STIs. In fact, we’re already seeing it. Although the \r\nfirst line treatment of benzathine penicillin remains highly effective, \r\nthere has been evidence of resistance to azithromycin, commonly used as \r\nan alternative treatment for syphilis and other common infections. There have been no reported cases of ‘super’ syphilis. There is, however, increasing resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium , a common STI that causes urethral discharge, and a common symptom shared with gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection as well. Luckily, there have been no reports yet of resistance to the treatment of chlamydia."}
{"topic": "/what-s-super-about-super-gonorrhea-a-q-a-with-who-s-dr.-teodora-wi", "question": "What happens if gonorrhoea is not treated effectively or is untreatable?", "answer": "When we talk about the risks of ineffectively-treated gonococcal infections, there are really 3 main areas of concern. Reproductive implications Gonococcal infections have critical implications to reproductive, maternal and newborn health including: a 5-fold increase of HIV transmission infertility, with its cultural and social implications inflammation, leading to acute and chronic lower abdominal pain in women ectopic pregnancy and maternal death first trimester abortion severe neonatal eye infections that may lead to blindness. Financial implications The financial costs of the complications mentioned above are very high for individuals and governments. AMR further increases this burden by prolonging the infection in more people and increasing the number of people with long-term sequalae. There is a real worry as we see both the number of people becoming infected and a rise in number of people with long-term complications associated with gonococcal infections. Spread of disease The emergence of different forms of resistance in N. gonorrhoea is often followed by a rapid spread of the disease. The effect of this\r\n is felt in all countries, but with disproportional effects in low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries, whose health systems maybe underdeveloped or \r\nlacking resources. It is important to remember that we are all at risk \r\nof epidemics produced by antimicrobial resistance."}
{"topic": "/what-s-super-about-super-gonorrhea-a-q-a-with-who-s-dr.-teodora-wi", "question": "What can be done to prevent antimicrobial resistance and spread of resistance in antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea?", "answer": "To prevent the continued problem of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infections two goals must be met. We must control drug resistance We must control gonorrhoea Controlling gonococcal infections involves a range of actions defined in the Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, Hepatitis and STIs (2022–2030): effective prevention and      control of gonococcal infections, using prevention messages and      interventions and appropriate evidence-based treatment regimens; effective drug regulations      in place; strengthened AMR      surveillance; especially in countries with a high burden of gonococcal      infections (expand >70% of countries to report AMR in N. gonorrhoeae to the WHO      Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme by 2030, compared to 36%      in 2020); strengthen the WHO Gonococcal      Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme by establishing regional networks of      laboratories to perform gonococcal culture, with good quality control      mechanisms and linked to epidemiological data; systematic monitoring of      treatment failures by developing a standard set of protocols for      monitoring; support research to find      low-cost tests to identify N. gonorrhoeae which would allow      effective screening; ensure high-quality,      evidence-based, people-centred services including STI case management with      same-day testing and treatment; research into newer      molecular methods for detecting antimicrobial resistance; and support research into      alternative effective treatments and vaccines for gonococcal infections."}
{"topic": "/what-s-super-about-super-gonorrhea-a-q-a-with-who-s-dr.-teodora-wi", "question": "What new medications are available/what new research needs to be done to stop resistant gonorrhoea becoming a worse issue?", "answer": "Increasing resistance to the last-line treatment for gonorrhoea, poses a big challenge because it limits the treatment choices. The development of resistance clearly outpaces the development of new antibiotics. There is an urgent need to develop new treatment\r\n    options for gonorrhoea. The Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), a joint initiative between WHO and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), aims to facilitate the development, clinical evaluation and registration of new antimicrobials and therapeutic regimens for gonorrhoea. This is being accompanied by a sound access strategy and stewardship framework, so that the newly developed\r\n    antibiotics are not lost to resistance within a few years after their introduction. Gonococcal AMR will only be effectively mitigated when additionally the global gonorrhoea burden is reduced. This is why sexual education is so important. Apart from prevention through safer sexual behaviour, the development of an effective gonococcal vaccine to prevent transmission is vital. It is likely the only sustainable solution for effective control of gonorrhoea."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: Tobacco growing is good for the economy as the government is earning foreign exchange", "answer": "FACT: In most countries, tobacco growing contributes to less than 1% of the GDP. The economic contribution of tobacco growing to local and national economies, employment figures and the national balance of trade is usually highlighted by the tobacco industry to prevent governments from adopting strong national tobacco control policies to protect the health of their people. In reality, there is no direct link between tobacco farming and demand for tobacco leaves in the country. In fact, the global nature of tobacco production and international trade makes it possible to import tobacco leaves from any country in the world. The economic value of tobacco as a profitable business and assured export market is also a common argument against switching to alternative crops. A large number of tobacco growing economies are facing food insecurity and are dependent on other countries for food. They are using the foreign exchange earned from exporting tobacco leaf to buy food when they have the land to grow food themselves. Many governments provide credits and loans, or significant subsidies to support tobacco growing so they are paying already highly profitable foreign transnational companies. Farmers in many countries get government subsidies for tobacco, which is counter to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) (e.g. North Macedonia, Lebanon, etc.). Yet, research consistently demonstrates that many farmers overestimate what they make from tobacco and how much it costs to produce it. Farmers and governments would be better exploring other crops which are more profitable for farmers."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: Tobacco farming empowers impoverished and vulnerable communities", "answer": "FACT: Tobacco farming contributes to gender inequality and often exploits child labour. Women are often the primary tobacco farm labourers and are obliged to work long shifts on the farm in addition to performing routine house chores and looking after children. They are therefore more exposed to the health risks of handling green tobacco leaves and heavy chemicals, as well as exposure to tobacco smoke during the curing process. An estimated 1.3 million children from poor households often miss school to support their families’ tobacco farming practices. These tasks often include mixing and applying pesticides, harvesting tobacco leaves by hand and tying them to sticks to dry, and sorting and classifying dried tobacco, thereby exposing children to both harmful chemicals and nicotine."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: Tobacco cultivation promises high returns and long-term benefits to smallholder farmers", "answer": "FACT: Smallholders are small-scale farmers who manage areas varying from less than one hectare to 10 hectares, rely primarily on family labour for production and use part of the produce for family consumption. Nonetheless, the tobacco industry targets smallholder farmers to grow a crop that cannot be consumed as food and earns little money for household. Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries are often contracted to grow tobacco through legal agreements with large transnational companies or their intermediaries under which tobacco prices and grades (or quality) are determined by the buyer, leaving farmers little room for negotiation. The buyer most often undergrade and therefore underprice the tobacco leaf, and at the same time inflate the cost of the inputs, further disadvantaging the farmers. The prices for tobacco leaf have also decreased since 2013, leaving the farmers with a labour-intensive production with very low profits for the time spent in growing the crop. Evidence shows that the labour costs of tobacco growing are enormous, as much as double the labour needed to produce other similar crops. The number of hours needed for tobacco growing does not translate to high profits for the farmers. The labour intensiveness of tobacco farming also means they don’t have time to gain education certificates or develop skills to be able to work in other areas where they could earn the family more money. Additionally, the cost of seeds, fertilizers, wood for fuel and renting or buying land is high and often not factored in when assessing the profitability of tobacco growing. Oftentimes the tobacco industry advances the cost of these, which is then deducted from farmers’ payment at the end of the season. Through this contractual arrangement, farmers end up disadvantaged, dependent and then trapped in a vicious circle of debt, unable to get a fair price for their product. Tobacco companies are able to do this because in most countries there is lack of rural credit programmes for other crops. It is also important to note that tobacco growing burdens farmers with health issues that can be unique to this activity, such as green tobacco sickness, also increases overall household health-care costs."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: There are currently no economically viable alternatives to tobacco growing, especially for small scale farmers", "answer": "FACT: Numerous studies and pilots have shown that there are a number of viable alternative food crop or various crop combinations that provide the farmers with similar or higher incomes than tobacco growing. Tobacco is often grown on fertile land that would be very productive if used to grow alternative crops. few examples of healthier, more sustainable alternatives to tobacco include high-iron beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes, maize, sorghum, rice and green vegetables. The success of alternative crop initiatives is subject to the availability of local market structures to support small holder producers with limited access to standardized quality management practices. This highlights the importance of government support to shape the markets for alternatives, thereby facilitating farmers to shift away from tobacco."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: Farmers want to grow tobacco, and they don’t need support to switch to other crops", "answer": "FACT: Farmers grow tobacco because of promise of high returns and long-term benefits but end up under contracts with tobacco or leaf buying companies, meaning that they have a low, but guaranteed income from tobacco leaf. At the same time, they end up trapped in a vicious cycle where they become dependent on the tobacco industry or its front groups. It is important for governments to provide the support needed to tobacco growing farmers to shift to viable alternative value chains. In many tobacco growing countries, credit is scarce and tobacco farming continues to be perceived by governments and farmers as a source of income/cash to generate revenues that would pay, for example, to support education and health needs of farmers. There are a growing number of schemes providing alternative options for credit and banking for farmers and these need to reviewed to not allow easy credits to tobacco growing and ensure they are diverted to alternative crops. These actions, along with elimination of direct subsidies to tobacco growing, will lessen farmer’s dependency on tobacco."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: The International Tobacco Growers’ Association (ITGA) and other farmers’ organizations represent and promote the needs of “millions of tobacco farmers” around the World", "answer": "FACT: The ITGA and similar front groups use tobacco farmers to represent the interests of a small number of transnational tobacco products manufacturers to “develop the agriculture lobby.” This lobbying pushes public opinion in favour of the tobacco industry and influences policy makers to weaken tobacco control policies. More information on tobacco industry lobbying groups is available here: https://tobaccotactics.org/article/Lobby-Groups/ https://exposetobacco.org/tobacco-industry-allies/"}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: There is no direct cause-effect relationship between tobacco cultivation and environmental degradation", "answer": "FACT: Tobacco farming leads to severe environmental damage including water pollution, soil degradation, and deforestation. Tobacco farming accounts for about 5% of total deforestation, further contributing to CO 2 emissions and climate change. To make space for tobacco crops, trees must be cut down and land cleared. It takes roughly one tree to make 300 cigarettes. This leads to desertification and hunger as there is limited fertile land to grow food in some of these regions. Approximately 200 000 hectares (ha) of land are cleared for tobacco agriculture and curing each year, which is equivalent to the size of Mauritius (204 000 ha). The environmental risks of tobacco leaf production are frequently underreported by the tobacco industry. Downplaying the health and environmental impacts of tobacco growing is a tactic the tobacco industry uses to promote its interests."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: The tobacco industry is trying to eliminate child labour on tobacco farms", "answer": "FACT: An estimated 1.3 million children are involved in tobacco growing labour. The tobacco industry gives a false impression of combating child labour by undertaking so-called corporate social responsibility initiatives and self-reporting its anti-child-labour initiatives. One such initiative is the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation, which hosts board members from British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco International, among others. These industry tactics are largely aimed at protecting the industry from human rights groups as millions of children continue to work on tobacco farms. CSR initiatives like the ECLT obscure genuine solutions and undermine diversification strategies, drowning the voices of stakeholders and enabling the tobacco industry to escape culpability."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: The implementation of tobacco control measures such as smoke-free environments, advertising bans and increased taxes on tobacco products will lead to a livelihood crisis among tobacco farmers because the price for tobacco leaves will fall", "answer": "FACT: Given the global nature of tobacco trade, there is no direct link between supply issues, such as growing tobacco, to demand reduction measures aimed at protecting current and future generations from using tobacco. Tobacco control policy drives slow incremental change. The current generation of tobacco farmers will be able to retire or slowly diversify without suddenly losing their livelihood. Tobacco control policies will also protect the health of farmers, their families and communities. The real source of vulnerability of tobacco farmers is their weak bargaining power against large transnational tobacco companies that can close down a country’s tobacco farming with immediate effect. Diversification and securing alternative income would protect against such vulnerability."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: The tobacco industry is committed to support farmers’ health and minimize environment harm", "answer": "FACT: The tobacco industry uses many “green washing” tactics to downplay the adverse impact of tobacco growing on the environment (such as water pollution, soil depletion, and deforestation) and on farming communities’ health and wellbeing (green tobacco sickness from tobacco leaves and children being out of school, working on farms). The tobacco industry employs corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to divert attention from harms of tobacco growing. The industry has set up several organizations and programmes which aim to support the livelihoods of tobacco-growing communities through crop diversification methods and schemes that aim to improve living standards of farmers. Introducing new crops while continuing to grow tobacco does not eliminate the risks of tobacco growing. These efforts divert public attention away from the real costs of tobacco farming, such as poor health outcomes, environmental degradation and poverty. Other greenwashing initiatives like tree planting divert attention from the industry’s environmentally damaging practices and helps them avoid being held accountable, and planting a few trees for a quick harvest will not replace the natural quality of the millennia old forests that are cut down every year for curing tobacco leaf."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-growing--myth-buster", "question": "MYTH: WHO and the WHO FCTC are anti-tobacco farmers", "answer": "FACT: Tobacco use is the single most preventable form of premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, respiratory disorders, heart diseases, etc. NCDs form the highest share of healthcare costs which burden on most economies including in LMICs and LDCs. The WHO FCTC provides an overarching and enabling set of actions to reduce the use of tobacco, by adoption of evidence-based solutions. More than 180 countries have adopted the WHO FCTC for achieving their goal of health for all. WHO supports global efforts to achieve better health for all including, accelerated implementation of WHO FCTC in line with SDG commitments, specifically Target 3,a. That means supporting farmers to grow crops that are healthy and sustainable for them and their communities.  Evidence shows that tobacco farmers’ income and wellbeing could improve if they diversified away from tobacco to food crops. Governments, international organizations, NGOs and private companies need to work together to help farmers diversify away from tobacco to healthy food crops by ensuring that they have easy access to more profitable markets. Article 17 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) states that Parties “shall, in cooperation with each other and with competent international and regional intergovernmental organizations, promote, as appropriate, economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers, growers and, as the case may be, individual sellers”. The WHO FCTC does not aim to penalize tobacco growers and workers, but instead to promote economically viable alternatives for tobacco workers, growers and, as the case may be, individual sellers who will be affected by a reduction of tobacco consumption."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "What is comprehensive sexuality education?", "answer": "Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) gives young people accurate, age-appropriate information about sexuality and their sexual and reproductive health, which is critical for their health and survival. While CSE programmes will be different everywhere, the United Nations’ technical guidance – which was developed together by UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women, UNAIDS and WHO – recommends that these programmes should be based on an established curriculum; scientifically accurate; tailored for different ages; and comprehensive, meaning they cover a range of topics on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, throughout childhood and adolescence. Topics covered by CSE, which can also be called life skills, family life education and a variety of other names, include, but are not limited to, families and relationships; respect, consent and bodily autonomy; anatomy, puberty and menstruation; contraception and pregnancy; and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "Why is it important to talk to young people about their sexuality and sexual health?", "answer": "Sexuality education equips children and young people with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that help them to protect their health, develop respectful social and sexual relationships, make responsible choices and understand and protect the rights of others. Evidence consistently shows that high-quality sexuality education delivers positive health outcomes, with lifelong impacts. Young people are more likely to delay the onset of sexual activity – and when they do have sex, to practice safer sex – when they are better informed about their sexuality, sexual health and their rights. Sexuality education also helps them prepare for and manage physical and emotional changes as they grow up, including during puberty and adolescence, while teaching them about respect, consent and where to go if they need help. This in turn reduces risks from violence, exploitation and abuse."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "When should sexuality education begin?", "answer": "Children and adolescents have the right to be educated about themselves and the world around them in an age- and developmentally appropriate manner – and they need this learning for their health and well-being. Intended to support school-based curricula, the UN’s global guidance indicates starting CSE at the age of 5 when formal education typically begins. However, sexuality education is a lifelong process, sometimes beginning earlier, at home, with trusted caregivers. Learning is incremental; what is taught at the earliest ages is very different from what is taught during puberty and adolescence. With younger learners, teaching about sexuality does not necessarily mean teaching about sex. For instance, for younger age groups, CSE may help children learn about their bodies and to recognize their feelings and emotions, while discussing family life and different types of relationships, decision-making, the basic principles of consent and what to do if violence, bullying or abuse occur. This type of learning establishes the foundation for healthy relationships throughout life."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "Who should be involved in providing sexuality education?", "answer": "Many people have a role to play in teaching young people about their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, whether in formal education, at home or in other informal settings. Ideally, sound and consistent education on these topics should be provided from multiple sources. This includes parents and family members but also teachers, who can help ensure young people have access to scientific, accurate information and support them in building critical skills. In addition, sexuality education can be provided outside of school, such as through trained social workers and counsellors who work with young people."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "Does sexuality education encourage early or risky sexual activity?", "answer": "Well-designed and well-delivered sexuality education programmes support positive decision-making around sexual health. Evidence shows that young people are more likely to initiate sexual activity later – and when they do have sex, to practice safer sex – when they are better informed about sexuality, sexual relations and their rights."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "Does sexuality education encourage masturbation?", "answer": "CSE does not promote masturbation. However, in our documents, WHO recognizes that children start to explore their bodies through sight and touch at a relatively early age. This is an observation, not a recommendation. The UN’s guidance on sexuality education aims to help countries, practitioners and families provide accurate, up-to-date information related to young people’s sexuality, which is appropriate to their stage of development. This may include correcting misperceptions relating to masturbation such as that it is harmful to health, and – without shaming children – teaching them about their bodies, boundaries and privacy in an age-appropriate way."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "How does sexuality education impact gender relations?", "answer": "There is sound evidence that unequal gender norms begin early in life, with harmful impacts on both males and females. It is estimated that 18%, or almost 1 in 5 girls worldwide, have experienced child sexual abuse. Research shows, however, that education in small and large groups can contribute to challenging and changing unequal gender norms. Based on this, the UN’s international guidance on sexuality education recommends teaching young people about gender relations, gender equality and inequality, and gender-based violence."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "How can sexuality education prevent sexual abuse?", "answer": "By providing children and young people with adequate knowledge about their rights, and what is and is not acceptable behaviour, sexuality education makes them less vulnerable to abuse. The UN’s international guidance calls for children between the age of 5 and 8 years to recognize bullying and violence, and understand that these are wrong. It calls for children aged 12–15 years to be made aware that sexual abuse, sexual assault, intimate partner violence and bullying are a violation of human rights and are never the victim’s fault. Finally, it calls for older adolescents – those aged 15–18 – to be taught that consent is critical for a positive sexual relationship with a partner. Children and young people should also be taught what to do and where to go if problems like violence and abuse occur. Through such an approach, sexuality education improves children’s and young people’s ability to react to abuse, to stop abuse and, finally, to find help when they need it."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "What is the impact of abstinence-based programmes?", "answer": "There is clear evidence that abstinence-only programmes – which instruct young people to not have sex outside of marriage – are ineffective in preventing early sexual activity and risk-taking behaviour, and potentially harmful to young people’s sexual and reproductive health. CSE therefore addresses safer sex, preparing young people – after careful decision-making – for intimate relationships that may include sexual intercourse or other sexual activity. Evidence shows that such an approach is associated with later onset of sexual activity, reduced practice of risky sexual behaviours (which also helps reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted infections), and increased contraception use."}
{"topic": "/comprehensive-sexuality-education", "question": "How can countries use the UN’s guidance on sexuality education?", "answer": "On sexuality education, as with all other issues, WHO provides guidance for policies and programmes based on extensive research evidence and programmatic experience. The UN global guidance on sexuality education outlines a set of learning objectives beginning at the age of 5. These are intended to be adapted to a country’s local context and curriculum. The document itself details how this process of adaptation should occur, including through consultation with experts, parents and young people, alongside research to ensure programmes meet young people’s needs."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "What are contaminated medicines?", "answer": "Contaminated medicines are medicines that are potentially unsafe for use or ineffective because they contain foreign substances or organisms including some physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter that should not be present according to the product’s specifications. Medicines can be contaminated when they are produced in inadequately controlled settings by poorly trained personnel, and/or shipped or accidentally stored without respecting the necessary standards. On some occasions, medicines are contaminated on purpose, for example, to save money or because an ingredient is hard to find or buy. It is estimated by WHO that up to one in ten medicines sold globally in low- and middle-income countries may be substandard, including ones that may be harmful to humans, or falsified. [1] Some contaminated medicines can cause severe sickness and even death. To reduce the risks associated with contaminated medicines, it is recommended that patients only take medicines that have been directly obtained from an official or accredited pharmacy, from a registered healthcare professional, or from a licensed healthcare facility or hospital.

{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "Where have these contaminated syrup medicines been found? Are there other countries where they could be for sale?", "answer": "Confirmed contaminated syrup medicines (following testing) have so far been detected in at least 5 countries: The Gambia, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Cambodia, , Marshall Islands, and Micronesia (Federated States of). However, potentially contaminated syrup products have also been reported in some other countries. While these countries have not reported to WHO any adverse events in patients arising from the use of such potentially contaminated medicines, they have acted to remove these medicines as a precaution to protect people from possible harm. It is vital that government, regulators, distributors, retailers, healthcare professionals and the public at large remain vigilant. This includes helping to identify, report, avoid and stop the use of any contaminated syrup medicines that may still be circulating in-country, whether at pharmacies, clinics and hospitals or through informal markets such as street or market stalls or on unregulated websites."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "What is being done to prevent the distribution of these contaminated medicines?", "answer": "Contaminated medicines that have been detected by national authorities have been put under surveillance. Efforts are continuing to ensure their use is stopped and that further sale or distribution of these products does not continue. WHO works constantly with regulators, manufacturers and other partners including the public to prevent, detect and respond to incidents related to contaminated medicines. Since these contaminated medicines were detected, WHO has issued several global medical product alerts (listed above) urging action to protect children and others from contaminated medicines. Those medical product alerts provide details on the contaminated syrup medicines that should not be used. Additionally, WHO is working with countries to promote securing the supply chains of the raw materials used to manufacture these products."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "Who is most at risk from the contaminated syrup medicines?", "answer": "Based on currently available evidence, children under 5 years are most at risk of potentially developing severe illness or dying after consuming the abovementioned contaminated syrup medicines."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "How can a person tell if a medicine is contaminated or not?", "answer": "It can be very difficult to tell if a medicine is contaminated. Many medicines that are contaminated can look, smell, or taste like the non-contaminated products. This is why countries must have rigorous and continuous safety checks on medical products to detect and destroy contaminated medicines, whenever possible. This is also why you should only take medicines that have been obtained from an accredited pharmacy, from a registered healthcare professional, or from a licensed healthcare facility or hospital."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "What are diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol?", "answer": "These are toxic chemical substances typically used in antifreeze solutions for air-conditioners, fridges and freezers, and as a solvent for many products, including cosmetics at very low concentrations. These chemical substances should never be used in medicines, as they can be fatal even if taken in small amounts."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "What should I do if I suspect that I have bought or taken contaminated medicine?", "answer": "If you suspect that you are in possession of a contaminated medicine, WHO recommends that you do not use it. If you or someone you know has or may have used a contaminated medicine, or suffered an adverse reaction or unexpected side-effect after taking a medicine, you are advised to alert and seek immediate medical advice and care from a qualified healthcare professional who should, in turn, inform the national regulatory authorities for medicines or the national pharmacovigilance center. Contaminated syrup medicines may result in serious injury or death. Side-effects of syrup medicines contaminated with diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol include pain in the stomach, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental states such as confusion, and acute kidney injury which may lead to death. There may be other unknown harmful side-effects. WHO and national authorities are continuing to monitor any other potential harmful side effects which may be reported."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "What actions can I take when using medicines?", "answer": "Every time you use a medicine, WHO recommends that you: Examine the packaging for its overall condition, spelling mistakes or grammatical errors; Check the manufacturing and expiry dates, and verify that any dates and other details on the outer packaging (pack or box) of the medicine match the dates and other details shown on the inner packaging (bottle or blister strip) of the medicine; As far as you can tell, confirm that the medicine looks correct and that it is not apparently discoloured, degraded or has an unusual smell; and If you or someone you know has or may have used medicine that you know or suspect to be contaminated, or have suffered an adverse reaction or a side-effect that is unexpected after its use, then please seek immediate medical advice and care from a qualified healthcare professional."}
{"topic": "/contaminated-medicines-affecting-children", "question": "What is WHO doing to raise awareness about contaminated syrup medicines?", "answer": "WHO issued four global medical alerts addressing these reported incidents in The Gambia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Uzbekistan, Marshall Islands and Micronesia (Federated States of). These medical product alerts were rapidly disseminated to the national health authorities of all 194 WHO Member States. In addition, on 23 January 2023, WHO published a call to action to various key stakeholders (i.e., governments, regulators, and manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of medicines) to protect children from contaminated medicines.  As part of this publication, WHO called for a series of actions including (but not limited to): The detection and removal of contaminated medicines from circulation in the markets, Increased surveillance and diligence within the supply chains of countries and regions likely to be affected, Immediate notification to WHO if these substandard products are discovered in-country; and otherwise inform the public of the dangers and side-effects of the substandard medicines at issue. WHO continues to work with the Member State Mechanism on substandard and falsified medical products in implementing its mandate to promote effective collaboration in the prevention, detection and response to substandard and falsified medical products to save lives."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What is COVID-19?", "answer": "COVID-19 is the disease caused by a coronavirus called\r\nSARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019,\r\nfollowing a report of a cluster of cases of so-called viral pneumonia in Wuhan,\r\nPeople’s Republic of China."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?", "answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever chills sore throat. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include: muscle aches severe fatigue or tiredness runny or blocked nose, or sneezing headache sore eyes dizziness new and persistent cough tight chest or chest pain shortness of breath hoarse voice heavy arms/legs numbness/tingling nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/ belly ache, or diarrhoea appetite loss loss or change of sense of taste or smell difficulty sleeping. Symptoms of severe COVID‐19 disease which need immediate medical attention include: difficulty in breathing, especially at rest, or unable      to speak in sentences confusion drowsiness or loss of consciousness persistent pain or pressure in the chest skin being cold or clammy, or turning pale or a bluish      colour loss of speech or movement. If possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic. People who have pre-existing health problems are at higher risk when they have COVID-19; they should seek medical help early if worried about their condition. These include, but are not limited to: those taking immunosuppressive medication; those with chronic heart, lung, liver or rheumatological problems; those with HIV, diabetes, cancer or dementia."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What happens to people who get COVID-19?", "answer": "As testing rates fall, it is more difficult to know how many people have COVID-19 and do not seek any treatment. At the start of the pandemic, 15% of people were thought to become seriously unwell and require hospital treatment and oxygen. More recent estimates suggest that hospitalization is required in around 3% of people with COVID-19. This is partly due to immunization, partly due to changes in the virus (especially the Omicron variants), and partly due to the availability of targeted medical treatments. Most people make a full recovery without needing hospital treatment. For those with COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe illness (see question below), WHO has made recommendations on which drug treatments are effective in improving outcomes and preventing hospital admissions. It is also important to be vigilant in recognizing people with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment so that they are treated early. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?", "answer": "People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical\r\nproblems like high blood pressure, diabetes, other chronic health problems (for\r\nexample those affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain), low immune\r\nfunction / immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, and unvaccinated\r\npeople are most at risk of severe illness. However, anyone at any age can get sick with COVID-19 and become\r\nseriously ill or die."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?", "answer": "Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms. These long-term effects are called post COVID-19 condition (also called long COVID). For further information on long COVID , see post COVID-19 condition and questions and answers ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?", "answer": "You can protect yourself and others from COVID-19 by following preventive measures, such as keeping a distance, wearing a mask in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, practicing hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette (covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze), getting vaccinated and staying up to date with booster doses. Check local advice where you live and work. Read our public advice page for more information."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "When should I get a test for COVID-19?", "answer": "Anyone with symptoms such as acute onset of fever and cough should be tested, wherever possible, to ensure that they receive appropriate clinical care. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing. Contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance. While a person is waiting for test results, they should preferably wear a mask when interacting with others in or outside of their household or sharing space with others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities. Individuals with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or those who test positive for the virus should wear a mask when interacting with others in or outside of one’s household or sharing space with others."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?", "answer": "There are two main types of tests that can confirm whether you\r\nare infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests,\r\nsuch as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are the most accurate tests for\r\ndiagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by\r\namplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. Rapid antigen tests\r\n(sometimes known as rapid diagnostic tests or RDTs) detect viral proteins\r\n(known as antigens). RDTs are a simpler and faster option than molecular tests\r\nand are available for testing by trained operators or by the individual\r\nthemselves (sometimes called self-tests). They perform best when there is more\r\nvirus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during\r\nthe time they are most infectious, generally within the first 5–7 days\r\nfollowing symptom onset. Samples for both types of tests are collected from the\r\nnose and/or throat with a swab.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?", "answer": "Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection\r\nin the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological\r\ntests, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection or\r\nvaccination. In most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks\r\nand can indicate if a person has had past infection or has been vaccinated.\r\nAntibody tests cannot be used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early\r\nstages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not someone has had\r\nthe disease in the past. If you have been vaccinated, many antibody tests are\r\nnot able to distinguish between whether you were previously infected or have\r\nbeen vaccinated (or both), so in such situations you will test positive in\r\neither case."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?", "answer": "Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the\r\nspread of COVID-19. Quarantine is used for certain persons who are a contact of someone\r\ninfected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, whether the infected\r\nperson has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from\r\nothers because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and\r\ncan take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means\r\nstaying in the facility or at home for several days. Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested\r\npositive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other\r\npeople, ideally in a medical facility where you can receive clinical care. If\r\nisolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high-risk\r\ngroup for developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you\r\nhave symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days. If you are\r\ninfected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 5 days\r\nfrom the time you test positive. You can be discharged from isolation early if\r\nyou test negative on a rapid antigen test."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?", "answer": "If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well. After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following: Call your healthcare provider to get tested or test yourself. Stay home if you feel unwell. Wear a mask when interacting with others in or outside of your household or sharing space with others. Clean your hands regularly. Practice respiratory etiquette: cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Avoid crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces. Get vaccinated and stay up to date with booster doses."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "How long does it take to develop symptoms?", "answer": "The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms\r\nbegin is, on average, 5–6 days and can range from 1–14 days. This is why people\r\nwho have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away\r\nfrom others in order to prevent the spread of the virus."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?", "answer": "Yes. There are several COVID-19 vaccines validated for use by WHO (given Emergency Use Listing) and from other stringent national regulatory agencies (SRAs). The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a regular basis here . For more information on vaccine for COVID-19, see the vaccine questions and answers: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Vaccines (who.int)"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?", "answer": "If you are unwell, stay at home. If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, wear a mask when interacting with others in or outside of your household or sharing space with others. If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility. Get tested for COVID-19, regardless of your vaccination status, and especially if you are at high-risk for severe illness and could therefore be eligible for drug treatments. Practice protective and preventive measures. Wear a mask, avoid crowded and poorly ventilated areas, improve ventilation in indoor spaces, keep a distance, practice hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette (covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze), get vaccinated and stay up to date with booster doses."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "Are there treatments for COVID-19?", "answer": "There has been huge progress in developing treatments for patients with COVID-19. Treatments for COVID-19 should be decided on an individual basis between the person and the healthcare professional looking after them. The choice will depend on the severity of disease and the risk of disease worsening (including the person’s age and whether they have any health problems). WHO maintains a list of recommended treatments, together with the evidence for each, available at https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/nBkO1E . These currently include: for non-severe COVID-19: nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; molnupiravir; remdesivir for severe COVID-19: corticosteroids (including dexamethasone); IL-6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab or sarilumab); baricitinib; remdesivir. Apart from these medications, amongst the most commonly and globally used, and important treatments is oxygen for severely ill patients. WHO leads work which aims to improve global capacity and access to oxygen production, distribution and supply to patients. For corticosteroids, further specific information can be found in the Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone questions and answers ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19", "question": "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?", "answer": "Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on\r\nbacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not\r\nwork. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of\r\nCOVID-19. In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to treat\r\nsecondary bacterial infections, which can be a complication of COVID-19 in\r\nseverely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to\r\ntreat a bacterial infection."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "What is post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "Post COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID, refers to long-term symptoms that some people experience after they have had COVID-19. People who experience post COVID-19 condition sometimes refer to themselves as “long-haulers”. These symptoms might persist from their initial illness or develop after their recovery. They can come and go or relapse over time. The most common symptoms associated with post COVID-19 condition include fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction (for example, confusion, forgetfulness, or a lack of mental focus or clarity). Post COVID-19 condition can affect a person’s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "How soon after getting COVID-19 can someone be diagnosed with post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "Post COVID-19 condition is usually diagnosed by a healthcare provider at least 3 months after a patient falls ill with COVID-19. This 3-month period allows healthcare providers to rule out the usual recovery period from an acute illness. Sometimes this recovery period can be long, especially if someone is very sick. Symptoms should last for at least 2 months from when someone first falls ill for it to be considered as post COVID-19 condition. Symptoms of post COVID-19 condition can persist from the initial illness or begin after recovery. The symptoms and effects of post COVID-19 condition can only be explained when other conditions with similar symptoms as post COVID-19 condition have been ruled out through a medical diagnosis. Symptoms may also change over time."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "What are common symptoms of post COVID-19 condition (long COVID)?", "answer": "Symptoms differ between people, and between adults and children.  Overall, the most common symptoms of post COVID-19 condition include: fatigue shortness of breath or difficulty breathing memory, concentration or sleep problems persistent cough chest pain trouble speaking muscle aches loss of      smell or taste depression or anxiety fever. People with post COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID, may have difficulty functioning in everyday life. Their condition may affect their ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "What should I do if I have had COVID-19 and am experiencing symptoms and effects like those described as post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "If you have ongoing symptoms after COVID-19, seek help from your healthcare provider. They will help you to determine the cause and provide you with the care you need to manage your symptoms. At present, there are no proven drug treatments for post COVID-19 condition. This is an area of active research. However, some commonly available medications can alleviate symptoms. There are data suggesting that holistic care can help patients regain their physical, cognitive and emotional function and help to improve their quality of life."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "Who is most at risk of developing post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "Anyone can develop post COVID-19 condition. Research suggests that approximately 10–20% of COVID-19 patients go on to develop prolonged symptoms that are associated with post COVID-19 condition. Current evidence doesn’t allow us to confidently know who is more likely to be affected, although certain problems (for example breathlessness) seem to be more common amongst those with more severe initial COVID-19, and more common in women."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "If I had a confirmed case of COVID-19 and I’m still experiencing symptoms, how long would it take before I could be diagnosed with post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "According to the WHO definition, symptoms should last two months or more before a diagnosis of post COVID-19 condition can be made, as we know that normal recovery can take this long. It is important that other causes for ongoing symptoms are considered. For more information, see the clinical case definition of post COVID-19 condition."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "How long does post COVID-19 condition last?", "answer": "We cannot predict how long post COVID-19 condition will last for any given person. Most people experience improvement in their symptoms, but we know that lingering symptoms can last from weeks to months. Currently, it remains impossible to predict how long post COVID-19 condition may last for any given person."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "What can I do to protect myself against post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "Taking measures to avoid COVID-19 infection is the most effective way to protect yourself against post COVID-19 condition. This includes public health and social measures that reduce your chances of getting infected. To keep you and your family safe remember to: continue to wash your hands regularly keep a distance from others wear a mask when in a crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated area get vaccinated and stay up to date with booster doses practice respiratory etiquette; cough or sneeze into your bent elbow."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "Does getting vaccinated prevent post COVID-19 condition?", "answer": "Research is ongoing. A vaccine’s ability to prevent post COVID-19 condition depends on its ability to prevent COVID-19 in the first place. The vaccines we use today are aimed at preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19. However, some people may still get infected with COVID-19 even after they are vaccinated."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-post-covid-19-condition", "question": "If I have post COVID-19 condition, can I give it to others?", "answer": "No, post COVID-19 condition cannot be passed to others."}

{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "Where and how is tobacco grown and cured?", "answer": "Tobacco is grown in over 124 countries as a cash crop, using an estimated 3.2 million hectares of fertile land. The top 3 tobacco leaf growers (China, Brazil and India, in order of production) account for over 55% of global production. As regulations tighten in middle- and high-income countries, tobacco companies are increasingly targeting African countries to scale-up tobacco leaf production."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How does tobacco growing harm the health of farmers and their families?", "answer": "Green tobacco sickness. As many as 1 in 4 tobacco farmers are affected by green tobacco sickness, nicotine poisoning. The disease is caused by nicotine absorbed through the skin from the handling of tobacco leaves. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, increased perspiration, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weakness, breathlessness and more. Exposure to heavy chemicals and nicotine. Tobacco farmers are exposed daily to tobacco dust and other chemical pesticides. A tobacco farmer who plants, cultivates and harvests tobacco may absorb nicotine equivalent to 50 cigarettes per day. Additionally, tobacco farmers often carry harmful substances home on their bodies, clothes or shoes, leading to secondary harmful exposures for their families, especially children. Chronic lung conditions. Tobacco farmers also inhale large amounts of tobacco smoke during the curing process, which increases the risk of chronic lung conditions and other health challenges. Vulnerable populations especially at risk. Women and children are often the primary tobacco labourers and are therefore more exposed to the health risks of handling green tobacco leaves and heavy chemicals as well as exposure to tobacco smoke during the curing process. Children are particularly vulnerable, given their body weight relative to the proportion of nicotine absorbed through their skin. Pregnant women are also disproportionally affected by the harmful effects of tobacco farming and face a higher risk of miscarriage. People who roll bidis (hand rolled cigarettes), especially women and children, get exposed to tobacco dust, which they inhale while stocking the tobacco at home and rolling-bidis, resulting in respiratory diseases and other health issues."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How does tobacco growing damage the environment?", "answer": "Heavy use of pesticides. Tobacco growing is resource-intensive and requires heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers, which contribute to soil degradation. These chemicals escape into the aquatic environment, contaminating lakes, rivers and drinking water. Land used for growing tobacco then has a lower capacity for growing other crops, such as food, since tobacco depletes soil fertility. Deforestation. Tobacco farming accounts for about 5% of total deforestation, further contributing to CO2 emissions and climate change. To make space for tobacco crops, trees must be cut down and land cleared. It takes roughly one tree to make 300 cigarettes. This leads to desertification and hunger as there is limited fertile land to grow food in some of these regions. Approximately 200 000 hectares (ha) of land are cleared for tobacco agriculture and curing each year, which is the equivalent of almost half the area of Cape Verde (403 000 ha). Loss of biodiversity. Tobacco growing contributes to habitat fragmentation, meaning that parts of the habitat are destroyed leaving smaller unconnected areas, which can undermine ecosystems and contribute to loss of biodiversity. It is also associated with land degradation or desertification in the form of soil erosion, reduced soil fertility and productivity, and the disruption of water cycles. Leaching of chemicals into nearby water sources kills fish and affects other humans and animals, including cattle, that access these waters for domestic use and drinking."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How does tobacco growing threaten food security and nutrition?", "answer": "Scarcity of quality land. Quality land is increasingly being used for tobacco growing in low- and middle-income countries, reducing the amount of land that could be used for crops to nourish people. Limited choice of alternatives. Choices of alternative crops are sometimes limited due to absence of strong assured markets as compared to the tobacco market, as well as of government support to transition away from tobacco growing. Degrading of soil. The tobacco plant and the chemicals required to grow it degrade the soil, and intercropping – the practice of growing two or more crops in close proximity – is a challenge as the soil is depleted of essential nutrients for productive farming. Crop intensity. Tobacco is a labour-intensive crop that takes up to 9 months to mature, which makes it difficult for smallholder farmers to grow food crops within the same year."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How does tobacco growing impact the household income of farmers?", "answer": "Debt. Growing tobacco requires access to supplies and services, such as seed and fertilizer, at the start of the season. The tobacco industry advances these costs, which are then deducted from their payment at the end of the season. Through this process, farmers end up in dependency and debt to transnational tobacco companies or intermediary traders. Under-grading and under-pricing of tobacco leaf. Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries are often contracted to grow tobacco through legal agreements with large transnational companies where the tobacco prices and grades (or quality) are determined by the buyer, leaving farmers little room for negotiation. Transnational tobacco companies forcibly reduce their costs through under-grading, and therefore under-pricing, of farmers’ tobacco leaf. The contractors also determine the cost of the inputs and they are inevitably inflated, further disadvantaging the farmers. Labour intensity. Tobacco growing is a labour-intensive practice, requiring farmers and their families to spend most of their day tending to the plants. The well-documented labour intensiveness of tobacco farming largely explains why smallholder tobacco farmers generally earn very little considering their efforts. When all the days worked by every contributing household member are included, studies show that tobacco farming is less profitable than other crops. Research across several countries suggests that this labour would be more valuable growing other crops. Cost of inputs. The cost of seeds, fertilizers, fuel wood and renting or buying land are expensive and often not factored in when assessing the profitability of tobacco growing. Healthcare costs. Tobacco growing burdens farmers with health issues that can be unique to tobacco growing, such as green tobacco sickness, increasing the overall household healthcare costs."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How does the tobacco industry make it difficult for farmers to shift to alternative crops?", "answer": "Trapping farmers in a cycle of debt. The tobacco industry keeps farmers dependent by providing them with incentives, such as loans or supplies needed to grow tobacco like seeds and agrochemicals. Often under contractual arrangements with the tobacco industry, farmers are then trapped in a vicious circle of debt, unable to get a fair price for their product. Tobacco companies are able to do this because there is a lack of rural credit available."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How does the tobacco industry try to disguise their deceitful tactics around tobacco farming?", "answer": "Greenwashing their tactics. Philip Morris International (PMI) launched a zero deforestation and no natural ecosystem conversion programme operated to protect natural habitats, particularly biodiversity sites of global importance and protected areas in 2022. Meanwhile, tobacco accounts for about 5% of total deforestation. Corporate responsibility schemes. The tobacco industry has set up several organizations and programmes which aim to support the livelihoods of tobacco-growing communities through crop diversification methods and schemes that aim to improve living standards of farmers. Introducing new crops while continuing to grow tobacco does not eliminate the risks of tobacco growing. These efforts divert public attention away from the real costs of tobacco farming such as poor health outcomes, environmental degradation and poverty. Pretending to protect children while perpetuating child labour. An estimated 1.3 million children globally participate in tobacco farming practices. Children from poor households miss school to support their families’ tobacco farming practices and boost income. These tasks often include mixing and applying pesticides, harvesting tobacco leaves by hand and tying them to sticks to dry, and sorting and classifying dried tobacco, thereby exposing them to both harmful chemicals and nicotine. Nonetheless, the tobacco industry gives a false impression of fighting child labour by undertaking so-called corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, and self-reporting their anti-child labour initiatives which are largely based on the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing (ECLT) Foundation which hosts board members from Japan Tobacco International (JTI), Imperial Brands, and British American Tobacco (BAT) amongst others. Lobbying with policy makers. The tobacco industry counters tobacco control, including tobacco tax increases, by purporting the protection of workers’ plight in tobacco agriculture and economic downfall. In reality, the decline in tobacco use is slow enough to allow sufficient time for farmers to diversify to alternative crops."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How are tobacco subsidies perpetuating food insecurity?", "answer": "In many tobacco growing countries, governments provide direct subsidies to tobacco farmers. In several countries, it is easy to get crop loans (or get crop insurance) for tobacco crops, sometimes with no collateral. Direct subsidies often incentivize and influence farmers to grow tobacco crops only because of the subsidies. As a result, more tobacco is produced than can be absorbed by the free market. Not only does this undermine the livelihoods of farmers, but it also costs government more money and drives the prices of tobacco down. Available data from the World Trade Organization demonstrate that several countries offer direct tobacco subsidies, including some high-income countries like the United States of America and Switzerland (US$ 142.8 million and US$ 4.57 million (4.2 million Sw.fr.) in 2021, respectively). In 2020, the government of Macedonia spent roughly US$ 32 million (€30 million) on tobacco subsidies. Funds allocated to tobacco production support could be used by governments more efficiently to stimulate food production instead."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "What is WHO doing?", "answer": "Tobacco-Free Farms is a joint initiative of the World Health Organization, World Food Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture, that has launched in Kenya. The initiative aims to create an enabling and supportive crop production and marketing ecosystem to help farmers shift from tobacco growing to alternative livelihoods. Roughly 1500 farmers have shifted to growing high-iron beans, but other good alternatives to tobacco include sorghum, millet and sweet potato. More on the initiative here ."}
{"topic": "/world-no-tobacco-day-2023---grow-food--not-tobacco", "question": "How can tobacco farmers be supported to shift to alternative crops?", "answer": "Governments in tobacco growing countries. Governments should accelerate the implementation of Articles 17 and 18 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and its guidelines that outline how governments can support farmers by offering technical advice on agriculture to farmers, linking them to necessary supplies and services to support their agricultural production, providing financial support to increase production of healthy food, and divesting away from tobacco and towards alternative crops. Seek political support for programmes to support farmers to shift to alternative livelihoods. Initial subsidies of supplies (quality seeds, fertilizers or farm equipment) to incentivize famers to make the shift until they have the financial means to sustain it on their own, especially given that supplies are a key factor in farmers’ decision to enter into contract with tobacco leaf buying companies. Extension services in the form of training and technical advice on agriculture, as well as support for farmers to access the necessary supplies and services for agricultural production, thereby increasing income. Programmes to better connect farmers to buyers of healthy, resilient, local and sustainable crops, so that they can be assured a viable market when moving away from tobacco. Support the development of farmers’ cooperatives to help in creating a robust information exchange and knowledge transfer mechanism and mitigate risk for shifting to non-tobacco crops. Support diversification strategies that are demand driven and pursue policies based on market dynamics. Hold the tobacco industry accountable for the risks posed to the environment and the health effects of tobacco cultivation and manufacturing. Working with government departments of public health and local government officials to sensitize farmers to the benefits of shifting away from tobacco and what alternatives are available. Develop community-based champions to lead the shift. Read more on country practices in the implementation of Article 17 here. Governments in countries that do not grow tobacco and only import tobacco leaf. Governments should recognize the additional burden placed on low- and middle-income countries to grow tobacco for consumption in high-income countries. High income countries that import tobacco need to incorporate tobacco control, including for alternative livelihoods to tobacco, as part of their development cooperation strategies. They must support alternative livelihood to tobacco growing initiatives which align with other commitments to support the health, environment and economies of low- and middle-income countries and least developed countries. Advocacy groups in tobacco growing countries. Groups should develop and share global and regional best practices, as well as educational programmes and information campaigns backed by data and evidence to prevent any attempt of the tobacco industry to misinform farmers and to help promote viable options available to tobacco growers and workers to shift to sustainable alternative livelihoods. They can also generate awareness amongst farmers to understand the negative health, environmental, social and economic effects associated with tobacco growing. For example, various initiatives under the Digital India Programme by the Government such as “Digital Village”,”Common Service Centres”, “e-Health”, e-education” etc. can be used for education, awareness and advocacy for tobacco farmers. Advocates from tobacco importing countries. Advocates are encouraged to call out the government for supporting tobacco production in low- and middle-income/least developed countries, especially those that are facing food insecurity and contributing to global food crisis, and for not walking the talk on tobacco control including alternative livelihoods as part of development cooperation. Civil society. Civil society organizations can expose industry efforts to impede efforts to support tobacco farmers to shift to alternative livelihoods as well as their efforts to greenwash their tactics. Microfinance institutions. Microfinance institutions can ensure that rural credit programmes benefit tobacco growers who are looking to shift so they can be supported to purchase inputs needed to grow alternative crops. UN Agencies. UN Agencies should work together to address SDG Targets 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 (improve food security and nutrition), SDG Target 3a (implementation of WHO FCTC), SDG Target 13 (combat climate change) and SDG Target 17 (strengthen partnership for sustainable development). This can be achieved by establishing enabling crop production and marketing ecosystems to support farmers to shift from tobacco to alternative crops. Private sector market players. Private sector market players can help shape the market for sustainable alternative crops by incentivizing farmers who shift by providing support along the value chain, including on inputs, post-harvest handling, aggregation and offtake.

{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms of cholera?", "answer": "Cholera is a bacterial infection that can cause severe diarrhoea and vomiting. The symptoms of cholera are: large amounts of diarrhoea (which sometimes looks like rice water) vomiting (which sometimes looks like rice water) leg cramps feeling weak. Severe diarrhoea can cause dehydration, which can lead to weakness and even death if not treated rapidly. Symptoms and signs of dehydration are thirst, weakness or fatigue, sunken eyes and decreased skin elasticity. Infants, young children, older people and people who are already sick are most at risk of getting severely ill if they get cholera. The most important things to reduce cholera deaths is for anyone with symptoms to drink oral rehydration solution as soon as they become ill, and to get to a health centre fast. Not everyone who is infected with the bacteria gets ill. Approximately 20% of people who are infected with the bacteria get symptoms. Symptoms usually start between 12 hours and 5 days after being exposed. Of people with symptoms, usually 20–30% develop severe disease."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "How does cholera spread?", "answer": "You can catch cholera by: drinking contaminated water; eating contaminated food (e.g., food that is raw, poorly cooked, or that becomes contaminated with poo (faeces) during preparation or storage); contact with the poo (faeces), vomit or things that have been contaminated with the poo or vomit of someone who has cholera; and unprotected contact with the body of someone who has died from cholera."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "What is the treatment for patients with cholera?", "answer": "Cholera treatment is simple: using oral rehydration solution. This can be bought/obtained from health workers or even made at home by mixing 1 litre safe water, 6 teaspoons sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. If someone has cholera, they should be given oral rehydration solution and then taken to a health facility, cholera treatment centre or oral rehydration point. People with more severe symptoms may need additional treatment, including intravenous rehydration and antibiotics. Most people recover from cholera fast with the right care. Most people are discharged from healthcare facilities within 3 days."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "Where is there a risk of cholera?", "answer": "Cholera is a threat wherever safe water supplies, sanitation, food safety and hygiene are inadequate. Water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are often inadequate in overpopulated settings where there is overcrowding (like refugee/IDP camps or prisons). Working hand-in-hand with communities to identify risks and improve water and sanitation systems can have significant benefits. People living in high-risk areas can reduce their risk by practicing good hygiene and safe food preparation."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "How can communities reduce their risk of cholera?", "answer": "Cholera outbreaks can be prevented by making sure that communities have access to safe water and good sanitation. Open defecation (not using toilets/latrines) is a major driver of cholera outbreaks. Providing communities with access to toilets/latrines can provide significant health benefits. Latrines should be at a safe distance (20–30 metres) from drinking water sources. People can reduce their risk by avoiding defecating in or near water. Dirty diapers should be placed in plastic bags before they are thrown away."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "There is an outbreak of cholera where I live. How can I reduce my risk?", "answer": "You can reduce the risk for you and your loved ones by: drinking safe water (well-monitored piped water, disinfected with household water treatment chemicals, boiled, or bottled); using safe water for washing and preparing food and for cooking; cleaning your hands regularly using soap and safe water (or an alcohol-based hand rub if there is no visible dirt), especially before eating, cooking, after using the toilet/latrine or changing your child’s diaper; cooking food thoroughly, keeping it covered, and eating immediately after cooking it; and not going to the toilet or washing yourself, hands or clothes near where you get your drinking water."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "How can I make sure that the water I have at home is safe to drink?", "answer": "There are several things you can do to make sure that your water is safe to drink at home. If it's well-monitored, water piped into your home is usually safe to drink. If your water looks dirty or cloudy, physically remove pathogens by filtering your water using a water filter, clean cloth, paper towel or coffee filter. After filtering, you should still boil or disinfect your water. You can boil your water for at least one minute before drinking. After boiling, store drinking water safely in a clean, tightly sealed container to avoid recontamination. You can also disinfect your water to make it safe to drink. After filtering, use household water treatment chemicals following the manufacturer’s instructions. If household water chemicals are not available, add 3 to 5 drops of chlorine (such as 5–9% unscented household bleach) to one litre of water. Wait at least 30 minutes before using. You can also drink bottled water."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "Is there a cholera vaccine?", "answer": "There is a vaccine available against cholera. It is called the oral cholera vaccine, or OCV. Being vaccinated with OCV reduces your chances of getting infected with cholera. Vaccination is a critical tool to stopping cholera, but access to safe water and sanitation is the most important thing to protect communities. OCV is safe and effective. Rare side effects include nausea, vomiting and mild gastrointestinal discomfort. The oral cholera vaccine can be given to children over one year and adults. It is safe for you to receive the oral cholera vaccine if you are pregnant. The cholera vaccine is an oral vaccine, meaning it needs to be swallowed. In a 2-dose schedule, the doses should be taken at least 2 weeks apart (and not more than 6 months apart). This provides you with protection for at least 3 years."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "What should I do if I think I might have cholera?", "answer": "Stay calm. Keep hydrated using oral rehydration solution (available from health workers, shops or can be made at home mixing 1 litre water with 6 teaspoons sugar and half a teaspoon of salt) or other fluids (soup, juice, soda, coconut milk etc.). You need to drink enough to replace the fluids you are losing. Seek medical care. Go to the nearest oral rehydration point, cholera treatment centre or health care facility as fast as possible."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "What should I do if I am caring for someone with cholera?", "answer": "Stay calm. Cholera is easily treatable if you act fast. Take care of yourself while caring for someone with cholera by washing your hands well after each time you have contact with them. Prevent the person who is unwell from getting dehydrated. Give them oral rehydration solution (available from health workers, shops or can be made at home mixing 1 litre water with 6 teaspoons sugar and half a teaspoon of salt) or other fluids (soup, juice, soda, coconut milk etc.). You need to help them replace the fluid they are losing; encourage them to keep drinking even if they can’t keep it down. Seek medical care. Take them to the nearest cholera treatment centre or health care facility as fast as possible. You should seek help immediately if the person is unable to take enough fluids due to vomiting, or if the diarrhoea is severe. Other reasons for emergency care are confusion or drowsiness, muscle cramps, weakness (unable to sit up by themselves) and dizziness."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "How can I use oral rehydration solution to treat someone with cholera?", "answer": "Oral rehydration solution can successfully treat 80% of patients. If someone is dehydrated, drinking water alone is not enough to help them recover. This is why using oral rehydration salts is important. ORS is solution prepared by mixing 1 sachet of oral rehydration salts in 1 litre of safe water.  Follow the instructions on the packet. If you don’t have oral rehydration salt sachets, you can make the same solution by mixing: half a teaspoon of salt 6 teaspoons of sugar 1 litre of safe drinking-water or lightly salted rice water. If you don’t have access to sachets or sugar and salt for the home-made solution, the most important thing is to keep the patient drinking anything and to seek care fast."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "Someone in my household has cholera. How can I avoid others getting infected?", "answer": "The risk of you catching cholera when caring for a sick person is low if you take some basic measures to protect yourself: Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and safe water after taking care, touching the clothes, or bedding of the sick person. Wash the sick person’s bedding or clothing away from drinking-water sources. Avoid direct contact with stools and vomit of the sick person. Place all waste in a toilet and ensure the latrine is properly disinfected. If the sick person is using the household or community toilet, make sure it is cleaned and disinfected thoroughly after each use. Don’t let the sick person prepare food. Mothers should continue to breastfeed infants and young children even if they have been diagnosed with cholera. Take care to avoid getting infected via the clothing and bedding of a sick person: Clean clothing and bedding by: machine washing between 60–90 °C with household laundry detergent following by a complete drying cycle or drying in direct sunlight; or if machine washing is not available, immerse in a large container of water, stir for 10 minutes and scrub to remove dirt (taking care to avoid splashes). Disinfect clothing and bedding by: immersing in boiling water for 5 minutes; or immersing in water with a 0.2% solution of chlorine for at least 10 minutes then rinsing. To make 0.2% solution of chlorine: If you are starting with 4% liquid bleach, mix bleach to water with a ratio of 1 : 19. Dry clothing and bedding by: using a full cycle of a dryer machine; or hanging to dry in direct sunlight."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "What should I expect if I or a loved one goes to a health facility/cholera treatment centre?", "answer": "When a patient arrives at a health facility, they will be assessed by a health worker to see whether they have cholera. In some cases, this may include a test, usually of the stool (poo). A health worker will collect a small sample of stool (poo) either from a bucket/container or directly using a swab. Collection using a swab may be uncomfortable if it is from your body directly but will not be painful. The sample is then either sent to the laboratory for testing or tested in the facility itself using a rapid test. Getting the test results can take less than an hour to a few days, depending on the type of test. In cholera treatment centres, health workers will help to make sure the patient remains hydrated using oral rehydration salts. If the patient is severely ill, he/she may be given antibiotics. Children may receive zinc tablets."}
{"topic": "/cholera-outbreaks", "question": "Someone I know has died from cholera. How can we give them a respectful funeral whilst avoiding anyone else becoming infected?", "answer": "Losing a loved one to any disease is incredibly hard. You will want to mourn together and mark their life through your traditional funeral practices. There is a very high risk of catching cholera from a dead body. This means it is important to take steps to reduce the risks to you and your loved ones. Take steps to reduce the risk of cholera spreading to yourself or others before and during the funeral. Hold the funeral and burial as quickly as possible (preferably within 24 hours after death). Work together as a community to identify alternatives to rituals where people touch or kiss the body. Trained health personnel should help you with the respectful and safe preparation of the body and burial process to prevent further spread of cholera. Handle the body as little as possible yourself. If working with a trained health personnel to prepare the body is not possible, protect yourself by: touching the body as little as possible; washing your hands thoroughly with soap and safe water after touching their body, clothes or bedding; removing and washing/disinfecting/drying any bedding, towels or clothing that may have had contact with diarrhoea or with the body; and washing bedding or clothing away from drinking-water sources."}

{"topic": "/guidelines-for-drinking-water-quality---frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What is in the GDWQ?", "answer": "The GDWQ provide the scientific point of departure for standard setting and regulation .  They describe evidence-based guidance on reasonable minimum requirements of safe-practice to protect the health of consumers and progress towards improving water safety.  They may also derive numerical “guidelines values” for constituents of water or indicators of water quality. The GDWQ describe the approaches used in deriving the guidelines , including numerical “guideline values”, and explain how the GDWQ are intended to be used. The GDWQ include an assessment of the health risk presented by the various microbial, chemical, radiological and physical constituents that may be present in drinking-water.  The GDWQ also define the criteria used to select the various constituents addressed. The GDWQ may be accompanied by separate texts that provide background information substantiating or elaborating on the recommendations included in the GDWQ, and by texts that provide guidance on good practice towards effective implementation of the guidelines."}
{"topic": "/guidelines-for-drinking-water-quality---frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How should the GDWQ be applied in countries?", "answer": "The GDWQ promote the protection of public health by advocating for the development of locally relevant standards and regulations, adoption of preventive risk management approaches and independent surveillance to ensure that national standards are being met. Countries should adapt their application of the GDWQ based on their own sociocultural, environmental and economic circumstances.  The GDWQ have a degree of flexibility and enable a judgement to be made regarding the provision of drinking-water of acceptable quality - each country should decide whether the benefit resulting from the adoption of any of the guidance including guideline values given in the GDWQ justifies the cost. In developing standards and regulations, care should be taken to ensure that scarce resources are not unnecessarily diverted to the development of standards and the monitoring of substances of relatively minor importance. Achievability aspects also need to be assessed, considering resource implications, ensuring that the most urgent problems are addressed with incremental improvement towards achieving long-term water quality targets. This approach should lead to standards and regulations that can be readily implemented and enforced and optimize public health protection."}
{"topic": "/guidelines-for-drinking-water-quality---frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What is the Framework for Safe Drinking-water?", "answer": "The “Framework for Safe Drinking-water” is the key recommendation in the Guidelines.  It encompasses complementary functions of national regulators, water suppliers and independent surveillance agencies and comprises: Development of drinking-water quality regulations and standards including health-based targets; Water safety plans (WSPs), a proactive risk management approach encompassing all steps in the water supply, to ensure the consistent delivery of a safe and acceptable drinking-water supply; Independent surveillance, to ensure WSPs are effective and that health-based targets are met."}
{"topic": "/guidelines-for-drinking-water-quality---frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How do the GDWQ keep step with science and best practice?", "answer": "WHO has published four editions of the Guidelines for drinking-water quality (in 1984, 1993 – updated with addenda in 1998 and 2002, 2004 – updated in 2006 and 2008, and 2011 – updated in 2017 and in 2022), as successors to the previous WHO International standards for drinking-water, which were published in 1958, 1963 and 1971. The International Standards were replaced with the GDWQ recognizing the advantage of using a risk-benefit approach in the establishment of national standards and regulations. Since 1995, the Guidelines have been kept up to date through a process of “ rolling revision ” to ensure the GDWQ continue to present the latest available evidence and scientific consensus, and to address key concerns raised by countries.  New editions usually introduce major new recommendations and are published following comprehensive review. The Guidelines, including its updates, are accompanied by a series of supporting publications and are referenced throughout the Guidelines."}
{"topic": "/guidelines-for-drinking-water-quality---frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Who participates in the GDWQ updates and how long does the process take?", "answer": "The GDWQ are the collective product of many experts and of extensive recovered experience.  While contributions are acknowledged, WHO is identified as the “author” of the GDWQ.  The rolling revision of the GDWQ is guided and supported by the WHO Secretariat housed in the Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Health Unit of WHO, in partnership with WHO Regional Offices. The Drinking-Water Quality Committee (DWQC, now called the Guideline Development Group) with its working groups (WGs) advises the WHO Secretariat on the development and revision of the GDWQ and associated guidance.  It identifies areas in which WHO should develop or revise guidance, and it oversees the process of developing such guidance to ensure that best available evidence and scientific consensus are reflected."}
{"topic": "/guidelines-for-drinking-water-quality---frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How is the independence and impartiality of the Guidelines ensured?", "answer": "Individual experts are invited to serve as members of the DWQC/GDG and its WGs, and are selected primarily on the basis of relevance of their expertise, excellence, independence, and willingness to support WHO’s drinking-water quality Guidelines work.  All members of the DWQC/GDG and its WGs are invited to serve as individual scientists and not as representatives of any government or other organization. WHO has a robust process to protect the integrity of its normative work. All experts who participate in the work of the DWQC/GDG and its WGs are expected to disclose circumstances that could give rise to actual or ostensible conflicts of interest through a Declaration of Interest process, thus demonstrating their ability to participate impartially in the development of the Guidelines , as a prerequisite to participation. Any potential conflict of interest should be declared in advance to WHO.  This does not necessarily exclude the person from participating in debate.  They will, however, refrain from participating in decision-making processes related to their particular area of conflicting interest."}

For example, in 2022 a new NCD global advocacy report and data portal were launched at the first HoS meeting in New York."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "Why use condoms?", "answer": "Latex and polyurethane condoms provide triple protection against the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as unintended pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "How do condoms work?", "answer": "Condoms block transmission of HIV and STI by preventing contact between the condom wearer’s penis and a sex partner’s skin, mucosa, and genital secretions."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "Do I still need to use a condom if I take PrEP or my partner takes PrEP?", "answer": "Yes, PrEP does NOT protect against other STIs besides HIV and having an STI can also increase your risk of HIV."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "How effective are condoms?", "answer": "If used consistently and correctly condoms are highly effective and cost-effective. Laboratory studies have proven that condoms are an effective barrier against even the smallest STI pathogens. Under conditions of perfect use, male condoms are up to 99.5% effective.[1] Epidemiological studies show that consistent condom use is highly effective in preventing transmission of HIV.[2] However, the “real world” effectiveness of condoms is lower due to user error and inconsistent use."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "What kind of condoms are there?", "answer": "External condoms : (male condoms or insertive condoms) are generally easy to access free of charge from health programmes or at low cost and without a prescription. Internal condoms : (female condom or receptive condoms) are more expensive than male condoms and less accessible; however, they have the advantage of being initiated by the person having receptive sex. This type of condom collects ejaculated semen and protects a wider area of the body than external condoms."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "Why use lubricant?", "answer": "When using condoms, lube makes it less likely that the condom will break, slip or fall off which increases your protection against STIs including HIV. Unlike the vagina or penis, the anus often does not provide adequate natural lubrication during sex. Plenty of lubricant should always be used during anal sex. [5,6]"}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "Types of lubricant?", "answer": "Use a water- or silicone-based lube, as other types may cause the condom to break down. Most widely available personal lubricants are water based, and these are commonly used as additional lubricants with condoms. Examples include K-Y Jelly, Astroglide, ID Glide and many others."}
{"topic": "/condoms", "question": "How do I use a condom correctly and what are some of the common mistakes when using condoms?", "answer": "How to use a condom check that the condom is not expired; carefully open the package without tearing it; pinch air out of the tip of the condom; unroll condom all the way down the penis; apply lubrication if needed; after sex but before pulling out, hold the condom at the base. Then pull out, while holding the condom in place; and carefully remove the condom and throw it in the trash. Common mistakes early removal; unrolling a condom before putting it on; no space at the tip; failing to remove air; inside-out condoms; and not withdrawing the penis while still erect.

It is recommended to verify that you are using the most\r\nrecent version of instructions which are posted on our website ."}
{"topic": "/pqt-ivd-questions-and-answers", "question": "I am submitting a RT-PCR kit to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, do I have to include the extraction step in my validation studies?", "answer": "Yes, the extraction step must be considered for all analytical and clinical performance studies. It is essential that the limit of detection is determined in each specimen type claimed using all extraction kits recommended in the instructions for use."}
{"topic": "/pqt-ivd-questions-and-answers", "question": "Do I need to provide detailed information regarding specimen collection and storage?", "answer": "More and more evidence is emerging as to how critical appropriate specimen collection and storage is in the testing process, and the potential impacts it can have on the IVD kit sensitivity. PQT-IVD consider it essential that the manufacturer fully understands the impact of the viral transport media (VTM) or other means recommended in the instructions for use as users will follow this information. If commercial VTM, in-house developed VTM or other storage solutions are recommended, it is essential that the manufacturer has evidence of its performance in the claimed specimen type."}
{"topic": "/pqt-ivd-questions-and-answers", "question": "I cannot get access to the full list of organisms that are required for NAT assay cross- reactivity studies. Can WHO source these specimens or conduct testing on our behalf?", "answer": "PQT-IVD team are not undertaking any laboratory evaluation on manufacturers behalf. However, we understand that some organisms are proving difficult to source in different jurisdictions. As long as manufacturers can demonstrate that they have made adequate attempts to source these specimens, we can accept the testing to be submitted at an agreed later timepoint when the manufacturer can access these specimens. We will review the overall dataset and accept that there might be some small gaps in the dossier where other sections have been addressed completely."}

Do we have to repeat the clinical studies?", "answer": "No, we will not necessarily request you to repeat your clinical evidence studies without reviewing the data you already have available. Please provide a justification for how you have chosen your comparator assay. We would expect that a minimum, that you have knowledge of the comparator assay primers and probes and that they are not the same sequences as used in your assay. As part of the dossier submission. PQT-IVD will consider this information as part of the total dossier."}
{"topic": "/primary-health-care", "question": "What is primary health care?", "answer": "Primary health care is about health at all ages. It involves prevention, health promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. This approach empowers people and communities to choose healthier lifestyles, prevent diseases, and access early detection, treatment and recovery services. Primary health care is not about building specific health facilities. It is an overall approach to strengthening national health systems to respond to people’s essential health needs more effectively. Primary health care goes beyond primary care, which is a subset of primary health care and refers to essential, first-contact care provided in a community setting such as community health posts. It ensures that people receive support closer to their everyday environments and are referred to secondary or tertiary care facilities, including hospitals, when the need arises. Primary health care encompasses 3 aspects: multisectoral policy and action to address the broader determinants of health; empowering individuals, families and communities; and meeting people’s essential health needs throughout their lives."}
{"topic": "/primary-health-care", "question": "Why is primary health care important?", "answer": "The world has committed to making health for all a reality and primary health care is one of the best tools we have for achieving that goal. There is a growing body of evidence in countries that support economic arguments in favour of increasing investment in primary health care. It has been proven that health systems with a primary health care-based foundation result in improved clinical outcomes increased efficiency better quality of care enhanced patient satisfaction. Through the Declaration of Astana , countries have reaffirmed the importance of primary health care. While many governments have been working to turn their commitments into action on the ground, in recent decades, primary health care has been neglected in many countries in favour of disease-specific approaches. Misperceptions of the role and benefits of primary health care, in combination with of lack of political will, are often seen as the cause of under investment."}
{"topic": "/primary-health-care", "question": "Is primary health care only for low-resource settings?", "answer": "No. Primary health care is an approach to health system strengthening that can work effectively in both high and low-resource settings. While it makes health services more accessible to communities, it also strengthens the referral system between primary care facilities and secondary or tertiary care, including hospitals."}
{"topic": "/primary-health-care", "question": "Is primary health care only about basic services?", "answer": "Primary health care provides essential care that can cover the majority of people’s health needs throughout their lives. Because primary health care focuses on the person rather than the disease, it is an approach that moves away from overspecialization. Its goal is to work through multidisciplinary teams with strong referral systems to secondary and tertiary care when needed."}
{"topic": "/primary-health-care", "question": "Is primary health care only about maternal and child health?", "answer": "Primary health care is about health at all ages. It involves prevention, health promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. This approach empowers people and communities to choose healthier lifestyles, prevent diseases, access early detection, treatment and recovery services."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "What is a Health Facility Master List (HFML)?", "answer": "The unique, complete, up-to-date and uniquely coded list of all the active and prior health facilities in the country officially that are officially curated by the mandated agency. At a minimum, the HFML includes a unique ID, location, type and name of each facility."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "What is the purpose of the GHFD initiative?", "answer": "To strengthen the technical capacity of the Ministries of Health across all levels to ensure the availability, quality, accessibility and use of a master list of health facilities by building on what already exists to avoid duplicated efforts and more\r\n    efficiently address public health priorities."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "Why should countries provide their HFML as a global public good?", "answer": "Centralizing health facility data in an open, global and standardized directory ensures verified information is integrated into a common system. As a global public good, it allows for consistent understanding and usage of the data, in addition to supporting innovation and new service development."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "How can countries access funding and support?", "answer": "The initiative is developing a resourcing plan. Support will be tailored for each country based on a needs assessment. Interested countries can contact their local WHO country office for more information or email ghfd@who.int."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "Who is involved in the initiative?", "answer": "The initiative is a cross-sectoral collaboration that includes: Ministries of Health and other government partners ; WHO global, regional, and country offices; donors, implementing partners and technical advisors with deep experience in GIS and health data."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "What is the operational structure of the initiative?", "answer": "WHO regional offices provide country and regional support and coordination. The WHO GIS Centre at headquarters facilitates the initiative’s global-level strategic, technical, and implementation working groups."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "How is the initiative defining a health facility type?", "answer": "The GHFD initiative is not defining a health facility type at the global level. Rather, country-level health facility definitions will be included in the metadata of each HFML. This approach ensures that we do not duplicate existing efforts nor create additional work for Ministry of Health staff. It also provides a more accurate account of health facilities within a country, as it reflects the differences between the Ministries of Health and cultural norms and definitions of what constitutes a health facility."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "What constitutes “location” of a health facility?", "answer": "Our goal is for the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each health facility to be accurately collected and captured in the HFML in addition to street name, administrative unit, etc. When geographic coordinates are not available, the name and unique identifier of the administrative unit in which the health facility is located will suffice while the Ministry of Heatlh  builds the capacity to collect geographic coordinates."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "How is the initiative promoting data interoperability?", "answer": "Unique identifiers in country HFMLs are critical to ensuring health facility level data can connect with and be used by other systems, services, and tools. The initiative encourages countries to assign proper unique identifiers in their HFMLs to support interoperability at the country level."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "Who is in charge of hosting and managing the directory?", "answer": "All countries are in charge of hosting and managing their HFML themselves, maintaining full control over their data. To help maintaining a sustainably integrated, functional, updated, and shareable HFML, the initiative offers support to countries to develop, maintain, and share their own HFMLs on their website as a Global Public Good.  A global directory will link to the respective HFMLs’ websites."}
{"topic": "/global-health-facilities-database", "question": "Why is the GHFD initiative focusing on the unique identifier, name, type and location of each facility?", "answer": "The GHFD initiative is intentionally focusing on four groups of data elements (unique identifier, name, type and location) because they capture the minimum information necessary to identify how many health facilities\r\n                                            exist in a country and where they are located.   Countries may choose to include, maintain and regularly update other data elements in their HFML."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "What is Early Essential Newborn Care (EENC) and how can it benefit you and your baby?", "answer": "Early Essential Newborn Care (EENC) is an essential package that includes immediate skin-to-skin contact between you and your baby shortly after the baby is born. EENC transfers life-saving warmth, placental blood and protective bacteria from the mother to the newborn. This simple act of love makes your baby pinker, calmer, stronger and healthier. EENC promotes a natural bond between you and your baby. EENC initiates exclusive breastfeeding, where babies are provided all the essential nutrients, antibodies and immune cells to protect them against diseases. Prolonged skin-to-skin contact is recommended for no less than 90 minutes."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "What is Kangaroo Mother Care?", "answer": "Kangaroo Mother Care or KMC is care for preterm infants through prolonged and continuous skin-to-skin contact. It is initiated in the hospital and can be continued at home with adequate support and follow-up. KMC: improves the health and well-being of infants born preterm or low birth weight, promotes better bonding between mother and child, facilitates exclusive breastfeeding, which strengthens the baby’s immune system, and provides effective thermal control, reducing the risk of hypothermia. Fathers can also provide skin-to-skin contact through KMC."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "What is exclusive breastfeeding?", "answer": "Exclusive breastfeeding is where the infant only receives breast milk without any additional food or drink, not even water, for the first 6 months. Exclusive breastfeeding protects your baby from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia, and helps with a quicker recovery if the infant falls ill. Exclusive breastfeeding also contributes to health and well-being of mothers: helps to space children, reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and is a secure and low-cost way of feeding."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "Can Early Essential Newborn Care apply to all types of deliveries?", "answer": "Early Essential Newborn Care (EENC) improves the condition of all babies including those who are premature, sick or born by caesarian section."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "Where is Early Essential Newborn Care available?", "answer": "Consult your healthcare provider to ensure you receive Early Essential Newborn Care. It should be available everywhere for every baby including low-birth weight, premature babies or even babies born by caesarean section."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "How do I know my baby is getting enough milk from breastfeeding?", "answer": "At birth, a newborn’s stomach is only the size of your thumbnail and requires a very small amount of milk per feed. As you keep breastfeeding, their stomach grows and your milk supply will too. Your baby will let you know when he or she has had enough by closing her or his mouth and taking no more breast milk. Try breastfeeding 8 to 12 times over the day and night, when the baby shows early feeding cues."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "How do I know when my baby is ready to breastfeed?", "answer": "Early signs that a baby is ready to breastfeed include drooling, then mouth opening, licking and biting of their fingers or hand. It can take several attempts before a baby is able to breastfeed successfully. Health workers should give mothers and babies time and space to try, and support them when necessary."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "I don't have enough breast milk. Should I add infant formula?", "answer": "Worries about not producing enough milk are common. But, with the right support, virtually every mother can produce enough breast milk for her baby or babies' needs. It’s all about supply and demand. The more you breastfeed, the more milk you produce. So, rather than supplement with infant formula (which will again reduce demand and therefore supply), try to breastfeed more frequently."}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "Is breastfeeding really that much better for babies?", "answer": "Absolutely! Breastfeeding has many immediate and long-term benefits for mother and child: Protection from diarrhoea, pneumonia and other common illnesses for the baby Lower risk of overweight, obesity, diabetes and leukemia in childhood and adolescence Reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer, diabetes and postpartum depression for the mother"}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "My nipples hurt when I breastfeed. What can I do?", "answer": "Adjust the baby’s position and attachment to resolve nipple pain while breastfeeding. Good feeding position: Baby’s head and body are in a straight line (neck is not twisted or flexed) Baby is facing the breast, with nose toward the nipple Mother is holding the baby’s body close to her body and supporting the baby’s whole body (not just neck and shoulders) Signs of good attachment: More areola is visible above the baby’s mouth than below Mouth is wide open with the lower lip turned outward Baby’s chin is touching the breast Baby’s sucking is slow and deep with occasional pauses"}
{"topic": "/early-essential-newborn-care", "question": "Should my baby and I stay together after the delivery?", "answer": "Yes. Mother and baby should stay together unless there’s a valid medical reason not to. When mother and baby have direct skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth, this really helps get breastfeeding established."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What is the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP)?", "answer": "The COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP) was launched in January 2022 by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and is supported by a broad network of partners including the Africa CDC, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations organisations, the European Union, the G20 and many others. CoVDP is an inter-agency partnership that works to accelerate vaccination coverage in the 92 “Advanced Market Commitment” countries with a particular focus on the 34 countries that were at or below 10% coverage in January 2022."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What is the CoVDP’s goal?", "answer": "CoVDP’s goal is to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination rates in countries with the lowest vaccination rates and support them in reaching their national targets on their way to global vaccination targets, thereby closing the vaccine equity gap that exists between high- and low-income countries. Closing the vaccine gap is essential as a highly vaccinated population diminishes the risk of transmission, lowers the risk of severe illness and hospitalization, and reduces the chances of new variants emerging globally. The CoVDP focuses first and foremost on the vaccination of high-priority groups such as the elderly, the immuno-compromised, pregnant women and health care workers."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why is the CoVDP needed?", "answer": "During 2021, COVID-19 vaccine supply constraints were the main bottleneck to increasing global vaccination coverage. In recent months, with significant efforts from partners through initiatives such as COVAX and AVATT, the global supply and availability of vaccines has substantially increased. The focus has now shifted to addressing the significant inequities in vaccine access that continue to exist as 61% of the global population is fully vaccinated against only 13% in low-income countries. Addressing low vaccination rates requires sustained, concerted and country-by-country efforts to identify and overcome the political, financial and operational obstacles that are the primary causes of low vaccination rates in these countries"}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How is the CoVDP different to COVAX and other partners?", "answer": "The largest vaccine operation in history, requires large scale coordination and cooperation —particularly in remote areas and countries dealing with humanitarian emergencies and fragile health systems. For this reason, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator was launched in April 2020 as a global collaboration platform to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The COVAX facility is the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator whose aim is to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.Across its partner agencies – CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO – COVAX supports the entire value chain of vaccinations from R&D, to manufacturing, procurement and delivery. The CoVDP is primarily focused on supporting the final piece of the vaccine value chain, namely the delivery of vaccines in-country, focusing in particular on country engagement, demand planning, delivery funding, delivery coordination and monitoring. CoVDP works closely with all COVAX partners but focuses on the delivery of all vaccines, regardless of whether vaccines have been procured via COVAX, AVATT, through other partners or bilaterally."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What has the CoVDP achieved so far?", "answer": "Since January 2022, the number of countries with very low vaccination rates has reduced significantly.   A total of 16 out of the 34 countries that have received concerted support to accelerate vaccinations since January 2022 had increased vaccination coverage to over 10% by June 2022, including six countries that have reached vaccination rates of 20% or more (Central African Republic, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands and Uganda). Through the CoVDP funding alignment workstream, we have reviewed and disbursed a total of $53 million to nine countries across the three agencies to cover short-term funding gaps that would have otherwise hindered the delivery of vaccines.  This includes $16.7 million for Ethiopia, $7.3 for Somalia, $5.8 for South Sudan, $5.7 million for Sudan and $4.9 million for Chad, all of which were used to cover the operational costs of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What are the main challenges that countries face in rolling out COVID-19 vaccinations?", "answer": "There are multiple causes for low demand and low absorption capacity, and they vary between countries, but they can be grouped broadly into three main categories: Political bottlenecks: These include a lack of coordinated political leadership at various levels, where COVID-19 is not considered a major priority or where there are competing priorities. Efficient planning and roll-out is not possible without political engagement. This is especially true in countries that experience humanitarian emergencies, conflict, and other fragile contexts. Funding challenges: These are mainly related to the coverage of operational costs for vaccine delivery, including payments and incentives for health workers, vaccinators and community mobilizers, training costs, transport, and logistics. Even where operational funding is available, it is sometimes insufficient or structures in an inflexible way. Operational challenges: These are common across most countries and include inadequate cold chain, logistics and transport equipment; insufficient availability of trained health workers, vaccinators, and community mobilizers; the complexity of managing multiple vaccines; demand-side factors such as vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and a lack of information about COVID-19 and vaccines."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What support do countries need to successfully increase the uptake of vaccines?", "answer": "There are several ingredients for success: to increase demand and absorption capacity: Predictable supply: It is important that vaccine manufacturers continue to provide realistic and accurate supply-side data with a 6-month horizon at a minimum. Quality dose donations : Vaccines with ample remaining shelf-life are needed to reduce the risk of wastage. A minimum of 4 months of shelf-life is needed but longer shelf-lives are preferred as many countries need more time to plan and deploy vaccines, especially fragile and conflict-affected states. Funding : Dedicated, predictable, and quickly disbursable financial resources are essential. Funding is needed for a range of operational and support activities around vaccine delivery. Flexibility, such as the ability to use funding meant for vaccine purchases for operational support when the situation requires it, is key to successful vaccine roll out. Strong leadership at all levels : The engagement of high-level government officials at the national and regional levels, as well as the involvement of traditional and community leaders are key ingredients in building trust in vaccines. Efficient planning : An efficient country coordination mechanism is key for planning and oversight of the COVID-19 vaccine delivery. Detailed microplanning at subnational level is key to optimize delivery strategies."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How does the CoVDP operate at a country level?", "answer": "At the country-level, the CoVDP engages primarily through the One Country Team, a government-led team at the centre of all planning and support activities. The One Country Teams represent existing coordination structures put in place at the start of the pandemic. The exact composition of the One Country Team varies from country to country but generally involves the highest-level government entity in charge of COVID-19 vaccinations (e.g., Office of the Prime Minister, Presidential Task Force, Ministry of Health), the Ministry of Finance, the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) and focal points from partners."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why is the CoVDP focusing on COVID-19 vaccinations if countries face multiple and possibly more urgent health priorities?", "answer": "The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, it continues to affect impact families, communities, and countries, causing between 65,000 and 75,000 deaths globally every week and hundreds of thousands of new cases.  Over 6.3 million lives have been lost to the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccinations protect the most vulnerable members of society, health care workers and frontline workers as well as the general population against severe disease and death that could overburden countries’ health care systems—many of which were already fragile prior to the pandemic. In addition, the systems required for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout strengthen countries’ existing health systems including cold storage, logistics, health ICT systems and the training of healthcare workers."}
{"topic": "/covdp-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How does the CoVDP prevent dose expiry and wastage?", "answer": "All partners are all working to increase vaccine uptake and minimise wastage wherever possible. Vaccine wastage is not a new phenomenon – it happens in all immunisation programmes, including in high income countries – and is to be expected with the rollout of COVID vaccines. While the data is incomplete, low-income countries have achieved relatively low levels of wastage, despite the swift pace of their scaled-up vaccination programs."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-ultraviolet-(uv)-index", "question": "What is the UV index?", "answer": "The UVI is a measure of the level of UV radiation. The values of the index range from zero upward - the higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. The UVI is an important vehicle to alert people about the need to use sun protection. A marked increase in the incidence of skin cancer in fair-skinned populations worldwide is strongly associated with excessive UV radiation exposure from the sun and possibly artificial sources such as sunbeds. Current evidence indicates that personal habits in relation to sun exposure constitute the most important individual risk factor for UV radiation damage. The UV Index is an important vehicle to raise public awareness of the risks of excessive exposure to UV radiation, and to alert people about the need to adopt protective measures. As part of an international effort, the UV index was developed by WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Meteorological Organization and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. Encouraging people to reduce their sun exposure can decrease harmful health effects and significantly reduce health care costs. The INTERSUN programme promotes the harmonized use of the UVI, and advises governments to employ this educational tool in their health promotion programmes. WHO encourages dissemination channels such as the media and tourism industry to publish the UVI forecast and promote sun protection messages."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-ultraviolet-(uv)-index", "question": "What does the UV index mean?", "answer": "The levels of UV radiation and therefore the values of the index vary throughout the day. In reporting the UVI, the maximum daily UV level, which occurs during the four-hour period around solar noon, is provided on a given day. . Depending on geographical location and whether daylight saving time is applied, solar noon takes place between noon and 2 p.m. In some countries, sun protection times may also be issued when UV levels levels are forecast to be 3 or higher. At these levels there is an increased risk of skin damage, and protective measures are recommended. How can the UV index help me to protect myself? The UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices. Most people are used to adjusting their daily plans and choice of clothing to the weather forecast, especially to temperature predictions. Analogous to the temperature scale, the UVI gives an indication of the level of UV radiation and the potential danger of sun exposure. It can help individuals make healthy choices. Step 1: Find out today’s UV Index Step 2: Check out the recommended sun protection. UV index Action 0 to 2 You can safely enjoy being outside! 3 to 7 Seek shade during midday hours! Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen and slap on hat! 8 and above Avoid being outside during midday hours! Make sure you seek shade! Shirt, sunscreen and hat are a must! Even for very sensitive fair-skinned people, the risk of short-term and long-term UV damage below a UVI of 2 is limited, and under normal circumstances no protective measures are needed. If sun protection is required, this should include all protective means, i.e. clothing, hat and sunglasses, shade and sunscreen. Where is the UV index reported? In many countries the UVI is reported along with the weather forecast in newspapers, on TV,  radio; internet and mobile applications."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-ultraviolet-(uv)-index", "question": "How can meteorological offices, national authorities and media use the UV index?", "answer": "The Global Solar UV Index is intended to be used by national and local authorities and non-governmental organizations active in the area of skin cancer prevention, as well as meteorological offices and media outlets involved with UVI reporting. The publication can serve as an entry point for the development and implementation of an integrated public health approach to sun protection and skin cancer prevention."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "Why should people donate blood?", "answer": "Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients. There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed. Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "What happens when I give blood?", "answer": "Whether you are a first-time or regular donor, the blood service must make sure that you will come to no harm by donating blood. This includes checking your blood to be sure it will be safe for the person who receives it. Before you give blood, you will be asked questions about your medical history, including any medication you are taking, and about your current health and lifestyle. You may also be asked about recent travel; for example, if you live in a country where there is no malaria, you may be asked whether you have recently visited a tropical country. These questions will be asked only to safeguard your own health and the health of the person receiving your blood. You will be told whether you are eligible to give blood and, if not, whether you may be able to donate blood in the future. Any personal information that you give will be kept confidential and will not be used for any other purpose. It is very important to be truthful about any reasons why your blood might not be suitable. Although blood is always tested for infections that can be transmitted by transfusion, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, a test may not be able to detect a very recent infection. This means that even though the blood may test negative for a particular infection, it might still infect a patient receiving a blood transfusion. After answering the questions you will also be given a brief medical examination that may include checking your pulse and blood pressure and ensuring that your weight meets a certain minimum. A drop of blood will then be taken from your fingertip to check that giving blood will not make you anaemic. Your health is very important to the blood transfusion service and blood will not be taken unless you can safely give a donation that day. Donating blood is very simple. You will be made as comfortable as possible, usually in a special chair or on a bed. The area inside one of your elbows will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution before a trained health worker inserts a sterile needle, connected to a blood collection bag, into your vein. It usually takes about 10 minutes to donate blood. After resting for 10 or 15 minutes and taking some refreshment, you will be able to return to your normal activities, although you should avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. You should drink plenty of fluids over the next 24 hours."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "How much blood will be taken? \r\nWill I have enough?", "answer": "In most countries, the volume of blood taken is 450 millilitres, less than 10 per cent of your total blood volume (the average adult has 4.5 to 5 litres of blood). In some countries, a smaller volume is taken. Your body will replace the lost fluid within about 36 hours."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "Is giving blood safe?", "answer": "Yes. Remember that you will only be accepted as a blood donor if you are fit and well. Your health and well-being are very important to the blood service. The needle and blood bag used to collect blood come in a sterile pack that cannot be reused, so the process is made as safe as possible."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "Does it hurt?", "answer": "Just squeeze the inside of your elbow tightly and you will get a quick idea of what the needle feels like. All you should feel is a gentle pressure and a momentary “pinprick” sensation. Blood donation is very safe and discomfort or problem during or after donating is very uncommon."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "Who can give blood, and how often?", "answer": "The criteria for donor selection varies from country to country, but blood can be donated by most people who are healthy and do not have an infection that can be transmitted through their blood. The age at which people are eligible to give blood varies, but is commonly between the ages of 17 and 65. Some countries accept donations from people from the age of 16 and extend the upper age limit beyond 65 years. Healthy adults can give blood regularly – at least twice a year. Your local blood service can tell you how frequently you can give blood."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "Who should not give blood?", "answer": "The blood service is concerned with the welfare of both the blood donor and the recipient (patient).  Donors are often asked not to donate blood for a period of time in the interests of their safety and/or that of the blood supply. You should not give blood if your own health might suffer as a result. The first concern of the blood service is to ensure that blood donation does no harm to the blood donor. You should not donate blood if: You are feeling unwell You are anaemic You are pregnant, have been pregnant within the      last year or are breastfeeding You have certain medical conditions, which might      make you an unsuitable donor You are taking certain medications, such as antibiotics. You may be able to donate blood at a later time. In some cases, however, in order to protect your own health you will not be able to donate blood. You should not donate blood if it might cause harm to the patient who receives it. Blood can transmit life-threatening infections to patients who receive blood transfusions. You should not donate blood if: You have or may recently have contracted a      sexually transmitted disease, such as HIV or syphilis, that can be passed      on to a patient who receives your blood Your lifestyle puts you at risk of contracting an      infection that can be transmitted through your blood: for example, if you      have more than one sexual partner or have sexual contact with prostitutes You have ever injected recreational,      non-medicinal drugs You have recently had a tattoo, skin      scarification or ear or body piercing – your local blood service can tell      you how long you must wait before giving blood You have had sexual contact with anyone in the above      categories."}
{"topic": "/blood-products-why-should-i-donate-blood", "question": "Can I give blood after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2?", "answer": "Consistent with current general global practice, recipients of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that do not contain live virus may donate blood if they feel well. As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed only recently,  in settings where deferrals would not compromise blood supply availability, the National Blood Transfusion Service may consider implementing a precautionary deferral period of up to seven days  to minimize the impact of call-backs from donors who develop symptoms subsequent to donating soon after vaccination. Recipients of live virus vaccines (e.g., virus vector based or live-attenuated virus vaccines) should be deferred for four weeks, consistent with current practices. Persons who feel unwell after receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should be deferred for seven days after complete resolution of symptoms, or as specified after receipt of a virus vector-based or live-attenuated vaccine, whichever is the longer period. In situations where it cannot be established whether the donor received a live virus vaccine, a four-week deferral period should be applied.

{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "What is acute hepatitis?", "answer": "Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. A sudden onset of hepatitis is called acute hepatitis. The most common causes of acute hepatitis are the viral hepatitis infections A and E, and less commonly hepatitis B and C. Certain medications and toxins can also cause acute hepatitis. Usually, it passes without any serious consequences or need for special care or treatment, but in rare cases may result in severe liver failure or death."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "What are the symptoms of acute hepatitis?", "answer": "Regardless of the cause, the symptoms of acute hepatitis include: -          vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain -          jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin) -          pale stools."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "Is acute hepatitis life-threatening?", "answer": "Typically, acute hepatitis passes without any serious immediate consequences. In some cases, acute hepatitis B or C infection may lead to chronic infection and cause scarring, loss of function, or cancer. Acute hepatitis is a more serious condition in adults than children. Adults show signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and fatal outcomes are higher in older age groups. The majority of young children do not experience any noticeable symptoms and few develop jaundice. It can pass quickly without need for special care or treatment, but it can occasionally lead to acute liver failure and even death. Practicing good hand hygiene can protect your child from infection with hepatitis A and E. If you are worried that your child has symptoms of acute hepatitis, contact a doctor for advice and to get your child the care they need."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "What do we know about the current reports of cases of acute hepatitis with unknown cause in children under the age of 10 in multiple countries?", "answer": "As of 20 May 2022, there have been at least 566 probable cases of acute hepatitis of unknown cause reported from 33 countries. The two countries reporting the most cases are the United Kingdom (197) and the United States of America (180). We know that seeing these cases in children is worrying for parents and caregivers. WHO is taking these cases very seriously and working with governments to find out what is causing them. At the moment these cases are still relatively rare. Cases of unexplained hepatitis in children do occur every year, but we are trying to find out if there have been more cases than usual this year or not. Some countries have reported that the numbers reported are higher than expected."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "What is causing these cases of hepatitis in children?", "answer": "We don’t currently know what is causing these cases. Cases of unexplained hepatitis in children do occur every year, but we are trying to find out if there have been more cases than usual this year or not. Some countries have reported that the numbers reported are higher than expected. The cases we are currently seeing are presenting with more severe disease than is normally expected in children with acute hepatitis. Some of the children affected have developed liver failure requiring more intensive care and liver transplants, and some have died. We are investigating several different possible causes, both infectious and non-infectious. So far, none of the cases seem to have been caused by the common viruses that can cause acute hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C or E). There doesn’t seem to be a particular place, food, medication, animal, bacteria or other illness in common between the cases. It is possible that there is a link to some viruses that cause cold and flu-like symptoms called adenoviruses. We are also investigating whether the cases of hepatitis could be linked to COVID-19. We are working to find out more."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "What should I do if I think that a child I care for has acute hepatitis?", "answer": "If you think a child you care for has hepatitis, seek advice from a doctor immediately. They will help them get the care they need. Symptoms of hepatitis are severe or persistent vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain that lasts longer than a few days, or the development of jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and pale stools. There are many different causes of acute hepatitis, and some simple investigations will help establish the likely cause and what treatment they may need."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "What can I do to protect children from acute hepatitis?", "answer": "Until we know more about what is causing these cases and how to prevent them, the best thing you can do is to take simple steps to protect you and children you care for from infectious diseases, including COVID-19: clean your hands often using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand-gel, and supervise young children to do the same; avoid crowded spaces and keep a safe distance from others; ensure good ventilation when indoors; wear a well-fitted mask covering your mouth and nose when recommended; cover coughs and sneezes; use safe water for drinking; and stay home when unwell and seek medical attention if you are concerned. As we know more about what is causing these cases, WHO will update its recommendations."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "How much should I worry about a child I care for getting acute hepatitis?", "answer": "WHO is taking the reports of children getting acute hepatitis from an unknown cause very seriously. Acute hepatitis in children is usually not a serious disease. However, in the recently reported cases, many of the children have been hospitalised and some required intensive care support. We are doing everything we can to find the cause and determine how to protect children. While it is hard not to worry, at the moment these cases are still relatively rare. The risk is currently low. Until we know more, the best thing you can do to protect children is to practice good hygiene, including hand hygiene. WHO will continue to provide updates as soon as we know more."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "Are we seeing these cases of acute hepatitis because our children’s immune systems have been weakened by being in lockdown for so long?", "answer": "We do not yet know what is causing these cases of acute hepatitis in children. We are working with experts and partners to explore all possible explanations. It is possible that more contact between people and spending time in new environments could lead to more chances of being exposed to germs. In some countries, we know that the spread of some viruses (such as adenoviruses and rhinoviruses) decreased while public health measures were in place for COVID-19, such as physical distancing and mask wearing. Since these measures have been lifted, we have seen an increase in the detection of these infections."}
{"topic": "/severe-acute-hepatitis-of-unknown-cause-in-children", "question": "Does getting my child vaccinated against COVID-19 increase the risk of my child getting acute hepatitis?", "answer": "Based on what we know at this point, theories that these cases of acute hepatitis could be linked to COVID-19 vaccines are not supported. The vast majority of children affected had not been vaccinated. For more information on getting your child vaccinated against COVID-19, see here ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tobacco", "question": "As a smoker, am I likely to get more severe symptoms if I get COVID-19?", "answer": "Tobacco compromises lung function, and COVID-19 primarily\r\naffects the lungs. Smoking tobacco is also a known risk factor for severe\r\ndisease from many respiratory infections, including coronaviruses SARS (first\r\nidentified in 2003) and MERS-CoV (first documented in June 2012). Smoking also\r\nimpairs the immune system and previous studies have established that tobacco\r\nuse is linked with poorer outcomes for people with TB and pneumonia. Evidence indicates that smokers are more likely to suffer\r\nmore severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as admission into intensive care units\r\nand death, than never smokers.  Furthermore,\r\nsevere forms of COVID-19 or deaths due to COVID-19 are more frequent in people\r\nwith comorbidities that are related to tobacco use, including COPD, lung cancer\r\nand cardiovascular diseases. There is currently only limited information on\r\nCOVID-19 in relation to other tobacco products (e.g. heated tobacco products,\r\nwaterpipe, cigars) and electronic nicotine delivery systems (e.g.\r\ne-cigarettes), although these products are thought to play an unfavourable role\r\nin COVID-19 severity."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tobacco", "question": "What about using smokeless tobacco, like chewing tobacco?", "answer": "Using smokeless tobacco often involves some hand to mouth\r\ncontact. Another risk associated with using smokeless tobacco products,\r\nlike chewing tobacco, is that the virus can be spread when the user spits out\r\nthe excess saliva produced during the chewing process."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-tobacco", "question": "What does WHO recommend for tobacco users?", "answer": "Given the risks to health that tobacco use causes, WHO\r\nrecommends quitting tobacco use. Quitting will help your lungs and heart to\r\nwork better from the moment you stop. Within 20 minutes of quitting, elevated\r\nheart rate and blood pressure drop. After 12 hours, the carbon monoxide level\r\nin the bloodstream drops to normal. Within 2–12 weeks, circulation improves and\r\nlung function increases. After 1–9 months, coughing and shortness of breath\r\ndecrease. Quitting will help to protect your loved ones, especially children,\r\nfrom exposure to second-hand smoke.

The toxicity of CO is acute and stems from its high affinity to the hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells Particulates\r\n of different size mostly elemental carbon (soot) and hydrocarbons \r\ndetermine black color of plum. Particulate’s size plays a critical role \r\nin determining how long they will be suspended in the air as well as \r\ntheir health effects (the lower size the longer they are suspended). Volatile\r\n organic compounds can include benzene which is a known carcinogen. \r\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of hydrocarbons produced by\r\n the incomplete combustion of oil which have been characterized as known\r\n or suspected carcinogens. Considering the low level of PAHs detected so\r\n far in oil products combustion plume, it is likely that they present \r\nonly a small exposure hazard."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "3. What are health risks due to the chemicals released during oil and oïl  products fire?", "answer": "Inhalation is prevailing pathway of exposure. Any resulting health \r\neffects would have depended on the concentration of the inhaled \r\npollutants, the duration of exposure, and the proximity/location of the \r\noil fires and its plume. The main target system is respiratory – nose, \r\nsinuses, throat, lungs. Gases and smaller particles settling in the \r\nmiddle respiratory tract. Still smaller particles can reach the lower \r\nrespiratory tract in the lungs. Pre-existing breathing conditions (e.g.,\r\n asthma, lung conditions from smoking) can worsen if very high levels of\r\n these particles are inhaled over a long period of time. Children and \r\npeople and cardio-respiratory conditions are at higher risks as well."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "4.    What are the symptoms of a short-term exposure to high concentrations of pollutants released during oil and oil products fire?", "answer": "Acute effects are caused mostly by particulate matter, carbon \r\nmonoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic \r\ncompounds. These include upper respiratory tract and skin \r\nirritation; runny nose; cough; shortness of breath; eye, nose, and \r\nthroat irritation; and aggravation of sinus and asthma conditions. Rare,\r\n dizziness of suffocation was reported."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "5. What can I do to reduce my exposure and to protect myself during oil and oil products fire?", "answer": "Unprotected exposure to the visible smoke plume should be avoided. Stay\r\n home if it is safe. To do so prevent penetration of outside air inside –\r\n close windows and doors, turn off ventilation and close ventilation \r\ngrades. Firefighters and others working near a large fire \r\ninvolving burning oil and associated plumes should be equipped with \r\nrespirators and dermal protection."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "6.    How would I know if a chemical had been released?", "answer": "There are a number of features that suggest a toxic chemical has been \r\nreleased: the more features noted, the stronger the likelihood. These \r\ninclude the following: an unexplained smell, such as a smell of garlic, \r\nhorseradish, onions, bleach or a fruity smell; a visible mist or cloud \r\nnot consistent with the weather; the presence of droplets or an oily \r\nfilm on surfaces; the presence of a suspicious device, such as an \r\nexploded shell or an abandoned tanker (especially in close proximity to \r\nthe smell or mist); multiple sick or dead animals, and multiple sick or \r\ndead people."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "7.    What are the medical signs and symptoms of a potential chemical exposure?", "answer": "Some typical symptoms include: eye irritation, itchy nose, sneezing, \r\ncoughing, difficulty in breathing, runny eyes and nose, drooling, itchy \r\nor stinging skin, a sudden urge to urinate, defecate or vomit, blurred \r\nvision, muscle twitching, dizziness, disorientation, feeling faint. It\r\n may be impossible to identify what type of chemical people have been \r\nexposed to because the symptoms caused by different chemicals may be \r\nsimilar, and the severity of symptoms depends on the duration and dose \r\nof exposure"}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "8.    What can I do to protect myself if I think that a chemical has been released?", "answer": "If the release is inside a building or a closed \r\nspace, you should do whatever it takes to find clean air quickly: exit \r\nthe building without passing through the contaminated area or break a \r\nwindow to access clean air. If you are outdoors, you should try to\r\n move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you\r\n can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or \r\nmoving crosswind. Many chemical weapons are heavier than air so it is \r\nusually a good idea to move to higher ground. If the release was \r\noutdoors, then moving into a building and closing windows, doors, vents \r\nand switching off any equipment that draws air in from outside (e.g. \r\nair-conditioners) will provide protection. Tune in to local authority \r\ncommunications and updates to hear instructions on any actions to take."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "9.    What should I do if I think that I have been exposed to a chemical release?", "answer": "Most chemical release and weapons are harmful by inhalation and some \r\nare also harmful by skin contact and absorption. Some chemicals have a \r\nrapid effect, such as most nerve agents, while others may not cause \r\neffects for a number of hours, such as mustard agents. It is important \r\nto remove chemicals from your skin as quickly as possible to prevent \r\nthem from being absorbed and from injuring your skin. Clothing provides \r\nsome limited and temporary protection from skin exposure and taking off \r\nyour clothes will often remove a large proportion of the chemical. Since\r\n contaminated clothing will provide a source of exposure to others e.g. \r\nanyone coming to your assistance, removing your clothes and placing them\r\n in a closable container (e.g. a strong plastic bag) will also protect \r\nother people. You should also try to wash yourself with soap and water, \r\nor with water alone, not forgetting your hair and ears. If your eyes are\r\n irritated then rinse them with clean hands and clean, cool water for \r\nseveral minutes. You should then seek medical help. For more information\r\n on decontamination see below."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "10.    How can I decontaminate myself?", "answer": "Once you have moved away from the source and found a safe place, you should remove your clothes as quickly as possible (see below), then wash your entire body and hair with soap and water (ideally), or with water alone. Do not scrub as this may damage\r\n    the skin and increase absorption of the chemical. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. When removing your clothes, you should try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet or powdery areas. Put the\r\n    clothes into a container that you can close such as a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects\r\n    into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed\r\n    of. If possible, decontaminate yourself before going to get medical attention. This will reduce your own exposure to the chemical and it will prevent you from contaminating other people and locations, including health care workers, and treatment centers.\r\n    Do not be surprised if you are put through another decontamination process before being allowed into a treatment facility.

{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "11.    How should I help someone who has been exposed to a chemical release?", "answer": "You should take care not to become contaminated yourself. You should \r\nnot enter a chemically-contaminated area unless you have been trained to\r\n work in such an area and are wearing a specialised personal protective \r\nequipment, including chemically-resistant suit and gloves, eye \r\nprotection and respirator with an air purifying filter. If this \r\nequipment is not available and the victim is conscious and able to move,\r\n then encourage the victim undress and wash him or herself. Find medical\r\n help for the victim as quickly as possible. Note that you should not \r\ntake chemically-contaminated victims into a health care facility \r\notherwise you will risk contaminating the facility and poisoning staff \r\nand other patients. Patients should be decontaminated before entering a \r\nhealth care facility."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "12.    What chemicals can be used as chemical weapons?", "answer": "In principle, any toxic chemical in combination with a suitable \r\ndelivery method can be used to inflict harm. During the 20th century, a \r\nnumber of groups of chemicals were developed on a large-scale as \r\nweapons. This category of weapon employs the toxicity of their active \r\ncomponents to cause temporary incapacitation, permanent harm or death. \r\nChemical weapons can be irritants, choking agents, disabling chemicals, \r\nblistering agents, nerve agents, or asphyxiants. Depending on the agent \r\ninvolved, and on the means for dispersal, chemical weapons can be in \r\nliquid, solid or gaseous forms. The development, stockpiling, transfer \r\nand use of chemical weapons are banned under the prohibitions of the \r\nChemical Weapons Convention, which came into force in April 1997."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "13.    What treatment exists?", "answer": "In most cases treatment involves removal from exposure, decontamination \r\nand symptomatic and supportive care, but the type of treatment required \r\nwill differ depending on the chemicals involved. Antidotes are available\r\n only for a very small number of chemicals, for example for nerve \r\nagents. These antidotes should be administered under medical supervision\r\n as soon as possible after exposure."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "14.    What are the effects of exposure to nerve agents?", "answer": "Nerve agents include substances such as sarin, tabun and VX. Some\r\n pesticides show a similar mode of action but are less toxic than nerve \r\nagents. These chemicals are absorbed by inhalation, and through the skin\r\n and mucous membranes. They are also toxic if swallowed, for example by \r\ningesting contaminated food or water. Once absorbed they affect the \r\nnervous system and cause, amongst other things, runny nose, watery eyes,\r\n drooling, sweating, vomiting and diarrhoea, incontinence, tightness of \r\nthe chest and difficulty breathing, coughing, confusion, muscle \r\ntwitching, collapse and convulsions."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "15.    What should I do if I think I have been exposed to nerve agent?", "answer": "Nerve agents can be liquid (droplets in the air or on a surface) or \r\nvapor, depending on the agent and the climatic conditions. Protection \r\nagainst nerve agents requires protection against inhalation and contact. That\r\n is why you should try to move away from the source as quickly as \r\npossible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing \r\nthe chemical away from you) or moving crosswind, and and avoiding \r\ntouching surfaces, or touching surfaces using protection (gloves, \r\ntissue, …).. Nerve agents are heavier than air and will tend to sink to \r\nlow-lying areas, therefore move to higher ground if you can. Once \r\nyou have reached a safe area, you should remove your clothing as quickly\r\n as possible (see section on decontamination), and wash your entire \r\nbody, including your hair, with soap and water (ideally), or water \r\nalone.

You should then seek medical help."}
{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "16.    What are the effects of exposure to chlorine?", "answer": "Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a distinctive bleach-like smell. \r\nIt is intensely irritant and exposure will immediately result in \r\nstinging and watering of the eyes, you may start coughing, have a \r\nfeeling of tightness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, headache and\r\n nausea and vomiting. After severe exposure, pulmonary oedema may \r\ndevelop after 12-36 hours. Chlorine may also cause skin irritation, and \r\nexposure to compressed gas as it is released from pressure can cause \r\nfrostbite."}

You can\r\n be exposed by skin or eye contact and by inhaling the vapour. These \r\nagents are also toxic if swallowed, for example by ingesting \r\ncontaminated food or water. Mustard agents can linger in the environment\r\n for several days. Mustard agents are irritant chemicals that can \r\ncause blistering and damage to the skin, eyes and lungs. Exposure may \r\nrelatively quickly result in eye irritation, coughing, hoarseness and \r\nmild irritation to the skin, but often the severe effects of exposure, \r\nincluding characteristic blistering, are delayed for several hours. \r\nEffects can include painful eyes and difficulty in seeing, retching and \r\nvomiting, itching and reddening of the skin and the formation of \r\nblisters, coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and chest infection. \r\nExposure to mustard agents does not usually result in death."}

{"topic": "/deliberate-events-chemical-release", "question": "22.    Can chemical weapons pose a threat to the food chain?", "answer": "Following the release of a chemical weapon, food and/or water may become contaminated. In addition, chemicals may deliberately be introduced into the food chain or water supply. The nerve agents sarin and tabun mix easily with water and, depending on\r\n    their concentration in the water, they could cause poisoning if the water was consumed or was used on the skin. These chemicals are not persistent in water, however, and usually degrade over 1-2 days. The nerve agent VX is less soluble but more persistent,\r\n    breaking down into a chemical that is toxic by ingestion. In water, mustard agents may form globules surrounded by a protective outer layer. These globules may settle out and may persist for several years, continuing to pose a hazard by contact and\r\n    by ingestion. You should avoid contact with, and consumption of, food or water that you think might be contaminated.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers", "question": "Someone in my household tested positive for COVID-19. They have very mild symptoms, and our doctor says it is safe for me to care for them at home. What should I do to keep myself and others in the household healthy?", "answer": "It’s hard when someone close to you is unwell. Even though you may want to provide comfort and company to your ill relative, it is important to reduce the likelihood that you or other family members catch COVID-19. For people with mild or moderate\r\n    symptoms, the best thing you can do is provide the care they need while also keeping a safe distance. First of all – protect the health of others in the household People with COVID-19 infection should (where possible) be isolated in a separate room, away from others in the home. If possible, close the door to stop air from moving from the infected person’s room into the rest of the home. If it’s safe,\r\n    open windows and turn on a fan in the room if you have one. No other visitors should be allowed in the home when someone in the household has COVID-19 infection. Follow guidance from your country’s health department or ministry about regarding\r\n    whether or not close contacts need to isolate at home. If it is not possible to isolate the infected person in your home, try to move people at risk of severe disease to a household where they will not be exposed to possible infection. If you have to share space in your home with someone with COVID-19, open windows to bring in fresh air if it’s safe to do so. COVID-19 spreads easily in places that are poorly ventilated. Learn more about ventilation . Secondly - protect the health of the person caring for the person with COVID-19 infection The spread of the COVID-19 virus occurs most often when an infected person is in close or direct contact with another person. If possible, there should be only one person in the household providing care to the person who has COVID-19 infection. If possible, choose someone to be the caregiver who is healthy and not at high risk. Caregivers should wash their hands before AND after any interaction with the person with COVID-19 infection. Both the caregiver and the person who is infected should\r\n    wear a medical mask whenever they share a space with each other. If possible, open windows when the caregiver is in the room with the person with COVID-19 infection. Monitor how you feel. Caregivers and others in a home with a person with COVID-19 infection should pay close attention to how they feel (even if they are vaccinated or are being careful). On average, if takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected for symptoms to show. However,\r\n    it can take up to 14 days. Symptoms may vary. Monitor yourself and others in your home for any symptoms of COVID-19 -- including fever, cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, muscle or body ache, headache, running nose, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea or\r\n    shortness of breath. Or altered mental status.  Get tested if you have any of these symptoms. Seek immediate medical care if you have any of these severe symptoms of COVID-19: Difficulty breathing Chest pain Confusion Loss of speech or mobility For young children, seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these symptoms: High fever Rapid breathing Lethargy or not interacting when awake Difficulty in feeding (unable to drink or breastfeed) Blue lips or face If you think you may have COVID-19 infection and are waiting for test results, avoid contact with other people if possible until you know whether or not you are infected. Watch for warning signs. Pay attention to any changes in the signs and symptoms a person with COVID-19 infection in your care. Some symptoms may be signals that more urgent medical care is needed. Depending on the age of the person in your care, their symptoms may look different.\r\n    Adults may look dehydrated, have shortness of breath or chest pains. They may also complain of light-headedness. Children may suddenly appear confused or refuse to eat. Their face or lips may turn blue. Babies may be unable to breastfeed. These symptoms\r\n    are warning signs that urgent care is needed. If the person with COVID-19 infection under your care shows any of these signs, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Keep things clean. Any surfaces and household items touched by the person with COVID-19 infection should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day. Household items include dishes, cups and flatware. COVID-19 can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre. A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact\r\n    with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1 metre. People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands. Continue to practice prevention measures . Keep a distance of at least 1 meter from others; Wear a well-fitted mask over your mouth and nose; Open windows Cough or sneeze into a bent elbow; Clean your hands frequently; and Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn."}

WHO recommends that people with COVID-19 be isolated in a separate room away from other members of the household. However, children should not be isolated on their own. If possible, there should be only one person, who is healthy and not at high risk, in the household providing care to the child with infection. The designated caregiver should take care of the child at all times and monitor their symptoms and safety. The caregiver should wear a medical mask when caring for the infected child and should wash their hands before AND after any interaction with the infected child. If it is possible and safe, keep the room or space well ventilated and open windows frequently. The child with COVID-19 infection should wear a medical mask in shared spaces, as long as the child can tolerate it. Prevent transmission to others If it is safe and possible, open windows to get fresh air into the room where the child with COVID-19 infection is staying. Where it is not possible to separate the child and caregiver from the rest of the family, try to separate those at high risk for severe disease from the child with infection and their caregiver. Keep things clean: Any surfaces and household items, such as dishes, cups and cutlery, touched by the child with COVID-19 infection should be cleaned and disinfected at least once a day. Separate dishes and eating utensil should be used from the infected child. Encourage members of the household to clean their hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Monitor the child with COVID-19 infection and others The caregiver and others in a home with a child with COVID-19 infection should pay close attention to how they feel (even if they are vaccinated or are being careful). On average, it takes 5-6 days from when someone is infected for symptoms to show. However, it can take up to 14 days. The caregiver and others in your home should pay attention for any symptoms of COVID-19: including fever, cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, muscle or body ache, diarrhoea or shortness of breath. Get tested if you have any of these symptoms. Seek immediate medical care if you have any of these severe symptoms of COVID-19: Difficulty breathing Chest pain Confusion Loss of speech or mobility The caregiver should pay attention and monitor COVID-19 symptoms of the child with infection regularly and seek immediate medical care if notice any of these symptoms: High fever Rapid breathing Lethargy or not interacting when awake Difficulty in feeding (unable to drink or breastfeed) Blue lips or face"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers", "question": "Our healthcare provider has recommended that I use a pulse oximeter as part of the care I am providing at home to a COVID-19 patient. What is a pulse oximeter and what does it do?", "answer": "A pulse oximeter is a small medical device used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood. People with COVID-19 may have low oxygen levels, which can be life-threatening. To measure the level of oxygen in the blood, a pulse oximeter is usually placed on the finger or toe of the person who is sick. Using a pulse oximeter is painless and only takes a few minutes. If your healthcare provider recommends the use of a pulse oximeter, be sure to get instructions about how to use it and how to read and understand the results, and report them to your healthcare provider. Accurate measurements and readings from a pulse oximeter are important signs in determining if and when a COVID-19 patient at home may need urgent care at a healthcare facility. As a general rule, a decline below 90%, or a progressive downwards trend, can be an early warning of need for further medical assessment. Most COVID-19 patients being cared for at home will not require a pulse oximeter. Learn more about medical oxygen and pulse oximeters."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers", "question": "What should I do if the symptoms of the person with COVID-19 infection in my care seem to be getting worse?", "answer": "If symptoms worsen, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Some symptoms may be signals that more urgent medical care is needed. Depending on the age of the person in your care, their symptoms may look different. Adults may look dehydrated, have shortness of breath or chest pains. They may also complain of light-headedness. Children may suddenly appear confused or refuse to eat. Their face or lips may turn blue. Babies may be unable to breastfeed. These symptoms are warning signs that urgent care is needed."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers", "question": "How long does the person with COVID-19 infection need to stay in isolation?", "answer": "People with symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after the first day they developed symptoms, plus another 3 days after the end of symptoms – when they are without fever and without respiratory symptoms. People without symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after testing positive. Monitor the symptoms of the person with COVID-19 infection’s symptoms regularly, and call your healthcare provider immediately if you see any of these danger signs: Difficulty breathing Chest pain Confusion Loss of speech or mobility For young children, seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these symptoms: High fever Rapid breathing Lethargy or not interacting when awake Difficulty in feeding (unable to drink or breastfeed) Blue lips or face"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers", "question": "Someone in my household has COVID-19. Do other people in the household need to isolate?", "answer": "WHO recommends that people who have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 infection should quarantine themselves if they have had face-to-face or direct physical contact with someone who has COVID-19 infection or is suspected to have COVID-19 infection. People who have not used medical masks or appropriate personal protective equipment in caring for someone with COVID-19 infection should also quarantine, if possible. Many countries and regions have their own policies about isolation and quarantine for people who have been in contact with people who have COVID-19 infection. Follow the guidance from your health department or ministry."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-families-and-caregivers", "question": "If I have been vaccinated against COVID-19, can I safely care for someone with COVID-19 infection without risk?", "answer": "No. Even if you have been vaccinated, it is important to continue practicing all other prevention measures too. Vaccination does not fully protect you against infection, and you may still spread the virus to others if you are infected. WHO recommends that you should still wear a medical mask and follow prevention measures when you are caring for someone with COVID-19 infection, even if you are vaccinated. Even though the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious disease and death, some people will still get infected or ill after they have been vaccinated. There is still a chance you could be infected with the virus and pass it on to other people around you who have not been vaccinated."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "What is the connection between health and refugees and migrants?", "answer": "Regardless of migration status, all refugees and migrants have the right to health and countries should provide refugee and migrant-sensitive health care services. Refugees and migrants often face vulnerabilities related to the condition of their journeys such as inadequate access to health services, food and water, sanitation and other basic services. They may be at risk of noncommunicable and communicable diseases, including vaccine-preventable diseases and food- and waterborne diseases. Access to healthcare and continuity of care is more challenging when people are on the move. Refugee and migrant health are also strongly related to the social determinants of health such as employment, income, education and housing."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "How do displacement and migration affect the health of refugees and migrants?", "answer": "Migration could both improve or diminish an individual’s health status. Refugees and migrants can be vulnerable to disease because of a lack of or restricted access to health care, interrupted care or under-immunization, exposure to infections and lack of care and poor living conditions in countries of origin, transit or destination. During their journey, they may face the risk of injuries, hypothermia or burns and be exposed to conditions such as overcrowding and inadequate hygiene. In transit and host countries, they may face policies that exclude them from access to health care. Many refugees and migrants, especially undocumented migrants, live on the fringes of society and may suffer from xenophobia, dangerous work and substandard housing. Women (as well as trans and gender diverse people who can get pregnant) may be affected by risks related to pregnancy and childbirth and lack of effective and timely sexual and reproductive health services. Exposure to gender-based and sexual violence, abuse and trafficking also represents a risk for many. There is also considerable variation in the mental health of refugees and migrants. People may suffer from mood disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Poor conditions, such as unemployment or isolation, are linked to increased rates of depression. Migration can affect children’s mental health. Refugee and asylum-seeking children may be at higher risk of experiencing mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder ( 1 ). Unaccompanied children are particularly vulnerable and may have unmet needs, including mental health needs. COVID-19 has posed additional challenges including the increased risk of infection and death, the adverse economic consequences of lockdowns and other restrictions (2), and a lack of access to health services and vaccination against COVID-19. Migration itself could also improve the health of individuals by improving the conditions that increased or prolonged their illness such as dire poverty, violence or natural disasters. However, the sustained benefits of migration and the impact on their health depends on the ultimate access to migrant-sensitive health systems designed to address in a continuous form the health needs of citizens and non-citizens alike. 2.

{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "Why is refugee and migrant health important?", "answer": "Global migration is a long-standing phenomenon. It may increase because of conflict, persecution, environmental degradation and climate change, and a profound lack of human security and opportunity. Many people move in the hope of improved employment and life opportunities. The correlation between health and migration is dynamic by nature and complex. Health is strongly related to the social determinants of health, including employment, income, education and housing. When not properly supported by appropriate intersectoral policies, migration can expose the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups to significant risks. Addressing the needs of these populations with well-functioning public health and health services responds to the human right to health, protects the health of both migrants and host communities, and contributes to integration and social and economic development. This is because refugees and migrants contribute to the society in which they live, especially when in good health. Access to information, prevention and appropriate care, including diagnostics, treatment and vaccines, is essential for these groups to fulfil their health needs. Furthermore, it ensures security for global public health."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "What are the definitions of refugee and migrant?", "answer": "The term refugee is defined in Article 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , which states, \"For the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'refugee' shall apply to any person who … owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it”. There is no universally accepted definition of the term migrant ( 1 ). However, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs defines an international migrant as “any person who changes his or her country of usual residence” and this definition includes any people who are moving or have moved across an international border, regardless of legal status, duration of the stay abroad and causes for migration ( 2 ) . Migrants may be given a migration status that limits their entitlement and access to essential services, including health care. However, international law guarantees universal access in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) ( 3 ) . Although governed by separate legal frameworks, refugees and migrants are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms as other people ( 4 )."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "Should refugees and migrants have health screening on arrival?", "answer": "There is no clear evidence of benefits or cost-effectiveness from screening. Therefore, WHO does not recommend compulsory disease screening of refugees and migrants when they arrive in a country. This can trigger anxiety in individual refugees or migrants, and in the wider community. It may deter people, especially those in an irregular situation, from asking for a medical check-up and can jeopardize the identification of high-risk patients. If screening is used, it should be associated with appropriate risk assessments serve the needs of refugees and migrants, and its effectiveness should be considered. It should be voluntary, non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing, carried out clearly for the benefit of the individual and the public, and be linked to accessing treatment, care and support. Attention should be paid to medical ethics including informed consent and confidentiality. Pre- and post-screening counselling should be offered. WHO has produced a broad range of technical guidance to assist States in carrying out assessments at borders in the context of COVID-19 while protecting human rights, including management of ill travellers at points of entry ( 1 )."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "Should refugees and migrants be vaccinated?", "answer": "Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health investments and a key component of primary health care. Vaccines underpin global health security and are critical to the prevention and control of infectious-disease outbreaks. A systemic and tailored approach to strengthening vaccination programmes is needed, with national policies that provide equitable and high-quality immunization services tailored to specific populations, including refugees and migrants, offered free of charge. Outreach strategies should be considered to improve the delivery and uptake of vaccines. Such strategies may include interpreters and cultural mediators; information in the languages of the refugees and migrants; collaboration between health and social services networks, local service providers and refugee and migrant communities; and training and culturally relevant information for health care and other professionals so they understand the specific needs of refugees and migrants. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a new focus and priority for the vaccination of vulnerable groups. Equitable access to vaccination, including for refugees and migrants, is of prime importance. Many countries, including those receiving large influxes of refugees and migrants, have adopted best practices and included them into their routine vaccination programmes. All countries should ensure the eligibility and access to vaccination services for refugees and migrants, as well as international travellers and marginalized communities, along with the host population."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "Should refugees and migrants be given health care?", "answer": "WHO supports policies to provide equitable access to health care services for refugees and migrants, irrespective of their migration status, as part of universal health coverage. Everyone should enjoy the human right to health and have full, uninterrupted access to high quality health care including access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines, as well as financial risk protection, in the country of origin, transit and destination, without discrimination based on gender, age, religion, nationality or race. Access to screening programmes that are in place for the host population (for example, screening during pregnancy, for antenatal, neonatal, and postnatal care) should be explicitly promoted for refugee and migrant populations, who should also have full access to health promotion and disease prevention programmes (such as vaccination). Diagnosis and treatment of noncommunicable diseases can prevent these conditions from worsening and becoming life-threatening. Good record keeping and cross-border continuity of care along the migrant journey are important but may be difficult to achieve. Access to specialist mental health services should be offered. Although some care may be given in temporary settlements, refugees and migrants should access care from the same facilities and clinics as the general population; mainstream provision is crucial to avoid the creation of parallel health systems."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "How should health care be organized for refugees and migrants?", "answer": "It is important that health systems systematically incorporate the needs of refugees and migrants in national and local health policies, financing, planning, and service design and provision.  Including refugees, migrants, and diaspora communities in decision-making is crucial to identifying challenges and solutions for refugee and migrant health. In rapid and effective emergency responses, life-saving health service may sometimes need to be delivered in parallel to national health systems, but in the long term, refugee and migrant health should be mainstreamed into existing health systems. Health systems should be sensitive to the needs of these populations, their culture, language and their unique health specificities. The main challenges and vulnerabilities of refugee and migrant populations must be identified by assessing their health needs and whether they are being met by the health system and public health activities, and how to adapt health system capacity and public health interventions. Health systems should deliver culturally informed, people-centred care and tailored population services, provided by competent supportive staff. Training should be provided for clinical, support and administrative personnel, and where possible, refugees and migrants with health professional backgrounds incorporated into the local workforce Patients should be equipped with knowledge of their entitlements. Access to interpreters and translated resources should be provided. Practical support may be required for patients to register, make appointments and attend services."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "What barriers do refugees and migrants face?", "answer": "Refugees and migrants often experience barriers in accessing essential services including health because legislation or regulations restrict access according to nationality or migration status; fear of immigration authorities and detection, detention and deportation; financial barriers; language and cultural differences; social stigma; administrative hurdles; and the inability to join local health financing schemes (particularly social insurance schemes). A significant challenge is the national acceptance in legal and policy terms of the human right to health of refugees and migrants. This acceptance requires political commitment to tackle xenophobia, discrimination, exclusion and misinformation about these populations and their health needs. Reduction or removal of communication and language barriers is key to improving access to services by refugees and migrants. However, while a common language is crucial, culturally competent services should offer more than just minimal communication. Refugee- and migrant- friendly services should be able to explain the host country’s system of health care, and use telephone interpreting, face-to-face interpreting, intercultural mediation, and supportive written information to improve health communication for both providers and patients."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "How is WHO supporting countries to help refugees and migrants?", "answer": "WHO’s Health and Migration Programme (PHM) brings together WHO’s technical departments, regional and country offices, as well as partners, to secure the health rights of refugees and migrants and achieve universal health coverage. To this end, the Programme has 5 core functions: to provide global leadership, advocacy and support for policy development and implementation relating to health and migration; to set norms and standards to support decision-making for responses to the health needs of refugees and migrants, and promote research to support evidence-based practice, and inform policy making; to monitor trends, strengthen health information systems and promote tools and strategies for progress monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Global Action Plan Promoting the health of refugees and migrants (GAP 2019–2023); to provide specialized technical assistance, response, and capacity-building support to address public health challenges associated with human mobility. The Programme assists Member States to strengthen health system capacity to meet the health needs of migrants and refugees, and host populations; promote emergency care; ensure migrant-sensitive health policies; improve the quality of health services; and optimize countries’ use of health structures and resources; and to promote global multilateral action and collaboration to accelerate progress and achieve continuity of care. Among WHO’s 6 regions, the numbers and situations of refugees and migrants differ considerably, and there is extensive knowledge and experience. Inter-regional sharing of information and good practices is promoted by PHM and contributes to improving recommendations and guidance, the wider dissemination of lessons learnt."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "What are WHO’s commitments for the health of refugees and migrants?", "answer": "At the 70 th Session of the WHO World Health Assembly in May 2017, Member States adopted WHA 70.15 on promoting the health of refugees and migrants , in the context of resolution WHA61.17 (2008) on the health of migrants. These earlier resolutions informed the WHO Global Action Plan Promoting the health of refugees and migrants (GAP 2019–2023), which was noted by the World Health Assembly in 2019 and represents WHO’s commitment to promote the health of refugees and migrants globally. In 2020, WHO established the Health and Migration Programme (PHM) to implement the Global Action Plan at global, regional and country levels by providing global leadership in health and migration issues. The WHO GAP is part of an international framework established by the United Nations to enable a constructive global approach to migration. This framework includes the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and two global compacts, the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM). WHO is part of the Executive Committee of the UN Network on Migration, set up to ensure effective, timely and globally coordinated system-wide support to countries in the implementation of the GCM. In line with the global policy framework on refugee and migrant health, in the European Region, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe adopted the European Strategy and Action Plan for 2016–2022. In the Region of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization also has a strategic document on migration and health. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, WHO EMRO prepared the draft refugee and migrant health strategy for the Region."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "How is WHO working to keep refugees and migrants safe during the pandemic?", "answer": "WHO is working closely with countries and partners to advocate for the inclusion of refugees and migrants in all aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic response, including access to reliable information, treatment and care, and vaccination. WHO is working to promote COVID-19 vaccine demand, confidence and uptake in refugees and migrants. WHO also supports countries and partners to address barriers that prevent refugees and migrants in accessing to COVID-19 vaccination services including through the development of interim guidance and operational guide, and closely monitors the implementation of the National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NDPVs). WHO co-leads the Executive Committee of the UN Network on Migration’s Working Group on access to services, which during the pandemic refocused on ensuring inclusion of migrants in the COVID-19 response and recovery. The UN Network’s 2021–2022 workplan includes promoting equitable access and inclusion of refugees and migrants in national vaccination rollouts. Through the Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (MPTF), a financing mechanism aiming to assist Member States in their national implementation of the Global Compact for Migration, WHO is working with other UN entities and national partners at the country-level to implement joint programmes to provide a collective response to specific needs."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health", "question": "Where is WHO active to help address the health needs of refugees and migrants?", "answer": "WHO works with regions to address the health needs of refugees and migrants at all stages of the migration journey, including during the pandemic, in countries such as Bangladesh; Burkina Faso; Cambodia; Cameroon; Colombia; Dominican Republic; Ecuador; Ethiopia; Greece; Guatemala; Guinea; India; Iran (Islamic Republic of); Jordan; Kenya; Lebanon; Libya; Malaysia; Mali; Mexico; Myanmar; Nepal; Niger; Nigeria; Pakistan; Peru; Rwanda; Serbia; Sierra Leone; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Sudan; Tajikistan; Thailand and Turkey. In all 6 regions, WHO provides specialized technical assistance, response and capacity-building support to Member States in developing and implementing strategies that respond to the health needs of refugees and migrants throughout their journey, and in all settings. WHO works closely with regional and country offices to scale up the implementation of the GAP 2019–2023. In the African Region, WHO works with country offices and partners to strengthen Member States’ capacity to integrate and respond to refugee and migrant health needs in areas such as logistics; vaccinating people against preventable communicable diseases; healthcare for children; and mental health services in humanitarian settings. WHO contributes to the review of GCM implementation. In the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization works with countries to address systemic issues that limit migrants’ access to health services and support the establishment of coordination mechanisms to ensure improved health outcomes for migrant and host communities. Simultaneously, it provides immediate, humanitarian health responses with sustained planning in health that considers migration challenges and opportunities. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, WHO prepared the draft refugee and migrant health strategy for the Region with national and regional experts, including high level political representatives, to advocate for international cooperation between Member States to promote the health and wellbeing of these populations in any given setting and throughout the routes of migration, echoing the WHO/EMRO vision that health is for all and by all and UN commitment to prioritizing refugee and migrant health on the international agenda. In the European Region, WHO is supporting Member States to manage and respond to public health aspects of refugee and migrant health, with a focus on preparing for and responding to refugee and migrant influxes and empowering frontline Member States and ministries of health with clear public health advice; identifying and filling knowledge gaps by strengthening public health knowledge on migrants and refugees; developing knowledge products and policy guidance; and promoting migrant-inclusive and migrant-friendly health systems in Member States. In the South-East Asia Region, WHO supports Member States to enhance health service delivery, focus on outbreak prevention and control, and strengthen community engagement to improve the health of refugees and migrants. In the Western Pacific Region, WHO is using community engagement strategies to reach migrant and refugees, to address barriers to help improve access to essential services and information and to strengthen data to promote evidence-based policies and programmes."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "What areas should be prioritized for disinfection in non-health care settings?", "answer": "Disinfection practices are important to reduce the potential for COVID-19 virus contamination in non-healthcare settings, such as in the home, office, schools, gyms, publicly accessible buildings, faith-based community centres, markets, transportation and business settings or restaurants. High-touch surfaces in these non-health care settings should be identified for priority disinfection such as door and window handles, kitchen and food preparation areas, counter tops, bathroom surfaces, toilets and taps, touchscreen personal devices, personal computer keyboards, and work surfaces."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "Which surface disinfectants are effective against COVID-19 in non-health care setting environments?", "answer": "In non-health care settings, sodium hypochlorite (bleach / chlorine) may be used at a recommended concentration of 0.1% or 1,000ppm (1 part of 5% strength household bleach to 49 parts of water). Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in order to not spread the dirty to areas that are less soiled. All disinfectant solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared every day. In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19. If disinfectants are to be applied, these should be via a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the disinfectant."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "What protection measures should people take when using disinfectants?", "answer": "It is important to reduce your risk when using disinfectants: The disinfectant and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public spaces). Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases. Keep children, pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is dry and there is no odour. Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas. Wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes. Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. Do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets. Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use. Do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes. The minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing. Note: Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "What is the guidance for the disinfection of outdoor spaces such as open markets, roads?", "answer": "In outdoor spaces, large-scale spraying or fumigation in areas such as streets or open market places for the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens is not recommended. Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage. This practice will be ineffective since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant, and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways. Even in the absence of dirt or rubbish, it is unlikely that chemical spraying would adequately cover surfaces allowing the required contact time to inactivate pathogens."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "Are public systems for disinfecting individuals such as spraying via tunnel or chambers safe to use?", "answer": "No. Spraying of individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not recommended under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who is infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as soon as they start speaking, coughing or sneezing they can still spread the virus. The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In addition to health safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent this resource from being used for important interventions such as drinking water treatment and environmental disinfection of health care facilities."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "What are the recommended practices once back home after outdoor activities?", "answer": "Thorough hand hygiene: washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand gel, should be performed before touching surfaces, items, pets, and people within the household environment. Please see: https://www.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/hand-hygiene-when-and-how-leaflet.pdf While outside, people should always follow physical distancing measures, staying at least one metre from another person; perform hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub; follow good respiratory hygiene\r\n    by covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and avoid crowded places."}

Wearing gloves in public spaces does not replace the need for hand hygiene, nor does it offer any additional measure of protection against the COVID-19 virus than hand hygiene. Gloves do not provide complete protection against hand contamination, as pathogens may gain access to the hands via small defects in gloves or by contamination of the hands during glove removal. People can also transfer pathogens from one surface to another by touching with gloved hands, or even transfer pathogens to the mouth, nose, or eyes if they touch their face with gloved hands."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-cleaning-and-disinfecting-surfaces-in-non-health-care-settings", "question": "How should I clean food items from the grocery store, for example fruit, vegetables or packaged items?", "answer": "There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply. The COVID-19 virus is generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of the COVID-19 virus associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 40-60 seconds. Regular food safety and handling guidance should be followed.

Trees are cut down to clear land for tobacco farming, in addition wood is burned for the curing of tobacco leaves after harvest. It takes approximately one entire tree, to make 300 cigarettes. Approximately 200,000 hectares of land is cleared annually for tobacco growing and curing. Tobacco farming accounts for about 5% of the total national deforestation, disproportionately affecting tobacco growing regions of the world, including Southern Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South America and the Caribbean."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does tobacco farming harm our soil?", "answer": "Fertile land that could be used to grow nutritious crops is used for tobacco. The soil depletion caused by tobacco growing further contributes to food insecurity and nutrition challenges. Rehabbing the soil after tobacco farming is costly. Based on data collected in 2014, it would cost 20.6 million USD to reverse the negative effects on soil in Bangladesh caused by one year of tobacco farming. Desertification attributable to tobacco growing is now being seen within many countries including Brazil, India, Jordan, and Cuba."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does the growth and use of tobacco affect water supplies?", "answer": "The entire life cycle of a single cigarette requires approximately 3.7 liters of water, this includes the growing, manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal. The average smoker could save up to 74 liters of water per day if they quit smoking. Tobacco growing depletes water tables. The cultivation stage of tobacco alone requires the same amount of water that an individual would need for an entire year. Based on the number of cigarettes produced in 2015 in Brazil, the 3rd largest producer of tobacco, 263,813,700,000 liters of water was utilized to produce its annual supply. Given that the average person drinks about 700 liters of water per year, if all this water were to be converted to drinking water, it would be able to hydrate an approximate 3.7 million people, which is about the entire population of its capital, Brasília. It is now well established that cigarette filters (butts) are among the topmost polluting and toxic substances found in water bodies. It takes a cigarette butt approximately 10 years to decompose, allowing time for nicotine and chemicals to leach into surrounding ecosystems. A study from the EPA concluded that when cigarette butts are soaked in freshwater for 96 hours, approximately half the fish died."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does tobacco pollute our air?", "answer": "To produce a single cigarette, 14g of CO 2 is emitted throughout its lifecycle. Tobacco production contributes almost 84 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalent emissions annually. That is equivalent to 280,000 rockets launching into outer space. Tobacco smoke contributes to higher air pollution levels and contains three kinds of greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides, which pollutes indoor and outdoor environments."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does tobacco contribute to littering?", "answer": "Globally, the approximate weight of waste generated annually from the overall tobacco life cycle is approximately 25 million metric tons. Almost all commercial cigarettes have a cellulose acetate filter attached; this additive is poorly degradable and a source of microplastics contamination of the environment. Approximately 4.5 trillion cigarettes are discarded in the environment every year. Surveys of littering behavior have found that approximately 65% of smokers discard cigarette butts improperly (e.g., on pavements, beaches, etc.) There are over 7,000 chemicals released into the environment from use of a cigarette – 70 of which are known carcinogens."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does e-waste contribute to environmental pollution?", "answer": "E-waste in general is already an overwhelming problem, with 99 billion pounds discarded annually according to 2017 global estimates. The disposal of e-cigarette cartridges and batteries represent a major environmental concern. Most plastic e-cigarette cartridges are not reusable or recyclable and end up in gutters, streets, and waterways. Improper disposal of these products is extremely harmful to the environment as they are made up of materials that are not biodegradable, such as metal coils, plastic, atomizers, batteries, and micro-controller chips. In addition, many products are single use."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does smokeless tobacco use contribute to environmental pollution?", "answer": "The indiscriminate use of plastic sachets/pouches has become a new environmental concern in several countries where smokeless forms of tobacco such as gutkha, pan masala, etc. are packaged and sold. The environmental, human, and ecological damage of plastic waste materials, especially to marine biology, is well documented. The problem with using plastic pouches for packaging smokeless forms of tobacco was initially limited to South Asian economies, but in the last decade or so it has become a global concern. This is due to aggressive marketing and introduction of gutkha and pan masala into new markets in both Asia and Africa."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How does tobacco’s environmental impact affect our health?", "answer": "Farmer’s health A tobacco farmer who plants, cultivates, and harvests tobacco may absorb as much nicotine per day as found in 50 cigarettes. Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS) is a form of nicotine poisoning that occurs in about 1 in 4 farmers. Tobacco farmers may also experience increased concentration of aluminum and arsenic in the blood due to exposure to pesticides. Chronic exposure to certain pesticides results in several health effects including birth defects, benign and malignant\r\n        tumors, genetic changes, blood disorders, neurological disorders, and endocrine disruption. Children’s health Often, children work on tobacco farms, and they are particularly vulnerable given that their body weight is relative to the proportion of nicotine absorbed through their skin from handling tobacco leaves. Youth tobacco farmers may experience increased\r\n        risk of early kidney disfunction as well as higher prevalence of smoking. Women’s health Women are disproportionally affected by the harmful effects of tobacco farming as they face a higher risk of infertility and reproductive issues."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "What are the humanistic and economic burdens of tobacco use?", "answer": "Tobacco use is associated with substantial humanistic and economic burden. Smoking is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and more. Smoking tobacco in indoor spaces, is a major contributor to air pollution, as it releases toxicants into the air, increasing risk of exposure of bystanders. Second-hand smoking is responsible for the premature death of 1.2 million people globally\r\n            every year, in addition to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Based on results from a 2018 study, the total global economic cost of smoking, from both health expenditures and productivity losses, is equivalent in magnitude to 1.8% of the world's annual gross domestic product (GDP). About 40% of this cost\r\n            occurred in developing countries."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "What tactics does the tobacco industry use to greenwash their reputation?", "answer": "Deceitful tactics are used by the tobacco industry to greenwash its reputation and portray itself as a sustainable and eco-friendly industry. These tactics are used to hide the fact that tobacco farming, production, consumption, and use are detrimental to both the surrounding environment as well as the health of farmers and tobacco users. For example, the intent of the industry’s self-reported data is to mislead the public into minimizing the effects of tobacco growing on the environment and communities of countries worldwide. The marketing and eco-labelling of cigarettes as ‘natural’ and ‘organic’ makes tobacco users believe the products are not harmful to them. Tobacco companies fund schools, health systems, environmental and disaster relief organizations, and clean-up of tobacco product waste programs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to be recognized for contributions to society. For more on green washing tactics, please refer to the STOP Infographic on greenwashing."}
{"topic": "/q-a-world-no-tobacco-day-2022", "question": "How can countries address the problem?", "answer": "Under Article 18 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, parties “agree to have due regard to the protection of the environment and the health of persons in relation to the environment in respect of tobacco cultivation and manufacture\r\n            within their respective territories”. Countries can impose the ‘Extended Producer Responsibility Policy Principle’ to mitigate the problem of tobacco and e-cigarette product waste, and to hold tobacco and related industries accountable for clean-up and waste disposal costs. Governments can impose an environmental tax levy on tobacco manufacturers, distributors and consumers for carbon emissions, air pollutants, and other environmental costs caused during the supply chain of tobacco products. Countries recognize the use of single use non-biodegradable plastics in cigarette filters and other nicotine products and should take appropriate action to phase out the use of plastics in nicotine and tobacco products. Farmers can be supported through government incentives to participate in crop substitution by growing more sustainable crops that will benefit the livelihood of the community."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?", "answer": "Pregnant women do not seem to be at higher risk of getting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, studies have shown an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 if they are infected, compared with non-pregnant women of a similar age. COVID-19 during pregnancy has also been associated with an increased likelihood of preterm birth. Pregnant women who are older, overweight or have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes are at particular risk of serious outcomes of COVID-19. It is important that pregnant women – and those around them – take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19. If they become unwell (including with fever, cough or difficulty breathing), they should seek urgent medical advice from a health worker."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "I’m pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?", "answer": "Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. Measures to protect yourself – and those around you – include: getting vaccinated; keeping space between yourself      and other people, and avoiding crowded spaces; keeping rooms well ventilated; wearing a mask where it is not      possible to keep sufficient physical distance from others; washing your hands frequently      with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; and practicing respiratory hygiene.      This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue      when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Call before going to a health facility and follow the directions of your local health authority. Pregnant women and women who have recently delivered should attend their routine care appointments according to local policies and following adapted measures to reduce possible transmission of the virus."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "Should pregnant women be tested for COVID-19?", "answer": "Testing protocols and eligibility during pregnancy vary depending on where you live. However, WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby?", "answer": "Transmission of the virus while your baby is in the womb or during birth is possible, but very rare. Most babies won’t develop COVID-19 disease, and those who develop symptoms tend to recover quickly. Babies can be infected after birth, so if you do get COVID-19, it is important for you and other caregivers to take all precautions to reduce the risks of passing the virus to the baby. Babies can be placed skin-to-skin and breastfed if the mother is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "What care should be available during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period?", "answer": "All pregnant and postpartum women and their newborns, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth, including mental health care. A safe and positive childbirth experience includes: being treated with respect and      dignity having a companion of choice      present during delivery clear communication by      maternity staff appropriate pain relief      strategies mobility in labour where      possible, and birth position of choice. If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and others, including hand hygiene and appropriate use of protective clothing like gloves, gown and medical mask."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "Do pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 need to give birth by caesarean section?", "answer": "No. WHO advice is that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified. The mode of birth should be individualized and based on a woman’s preferences alongside obstetric indications."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "Can I touch and hold my newborn baby if I have COVID-19?", "answer": "Yes. Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive. You should be supported to breastfeed safely, with good      respiratory hygiene hold your newborn skin-to-skin share a room with your baby."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-pregnancy-and-childbirth", "question": "Can pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19?", "answer": "Yes, pregnant women can be vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Vaccination during pregnancy is important whenever there is risk of the disease, but especially for frontline health workers, people living in areas where there is high community transmission, and those with health conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes that add to risk of severe disease. Some evidence also suggests that babies may receive protective benefits from the vaccine, in addition to the benefits for pregnant women. Pregnant women in many countries around the world have now received COVID-19 vaccines, and no safety concerns have been identified related to their pregnancies or the health of their babies. None of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized to date use live viruses, which are more likely to pose risks during pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "1. What are the first steps in developing a readiness proposal?", "answer": "As a starting point for readiness proposal development, please consider the following steps (these steps are provided as a suggestion, however, the actual process will depend on the country context): Identify the needs of the health sector in relation to climate change. If your country’s action plans have been already established, such plans could serve a good reference point; Review the with the GCF Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook to match your country needs with eligible activities for the Readiness Programme; In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) formulate the needs and categorize them into one or more of the five relevant funding objectives listed above; With the MoH, inform your NDA that WHO is now a delivery partner of Readiness Programme and communicate the identified needs to the NDA; Undertake a trilateral discussion between NDA, WHO and GCF Secretariat (Regional Officers in DCP) on the potential proposal. This communication should be ongoing throughout the proposal development process; Determine the NDA’s interest in the proposed activities and, with the MoH, discuss the opportunity for WHO to access readiness funds could be accessed as a delivery partner; Check with the NDA the availability of readiness funds under the two funding options, considering other readiness proposals that have been submitted or are under development; Complete the required documentation (listed in the readiness proposal template) in partnership with the MoH and any other partners and provide to the NDA for submission."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "2. What is the PPF?", "answer": "The PPF is a Project Preparation Facility under the readiness support program set up to help countries develop fully-fledged proposals for submission to the GCF. There are a number of studies that should inform the proposal development and often these are costly in terms of financial and human resources. Through the PPF, the GCF tries to reduce the burden no countries to help them design proposals that meet the GCF objectives and key result areas."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "3. How much funds can be accessed under the PPF?", "answer": "Up to $1.5 billion is available for each single project through the PPF. To apply for the funds, a specific template for the PPF and a concept note endorsed by the GCF is required."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "4. Who is responsible for submitting the GCF readiness proposal?", "answer": "The NDA will submit the proposal through Fluxx, the online GCF submission and proposal management tool."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "5. What are the deadlines for submitting a readiness proposal?", "answer": "There are no deadlines for submitting a proposal to access the USD 3 million one-time funding bucket for NAP/adaptation planning. The following dates are the current submission deadlines for proposals requesting access to the USD 1 million per year (i.e. all non-NAP (/H-NAP) proposals), There are two important deadlines for proposals to be considered for the 2021 budget year: 30 June 2021: NDA submission of a proposal through the GCF submission system (Fluxx) in order to be considered for the 2021 budget cap year 31 December 2021: Proposals must be approved by the Secretariat and signed for approval by the Deputy Executive Director, GCF NOTE: Kindly note that the ability of the Secretariat to approve submitted proposals depends on the quality of proposals initially submitted. In addition, please be advised that, during the proposal review-revision process, the Secretariat also relies on NDAs and Delivery Partners to incorporate Secretariat feedback and resubmit revised proposals in an efficient manner. Thus, the Secretariat cannot guarantee that proposals submitted by 30 June 2021 will be approved by 31 December 2021. Proposals will be counted against the annual cap according to the date they are approved, not the date they are submitted."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "6. Does the funding for a readiness proposal count towards the funding limit of the year the proposal is submitted or the year that it is approved (if they are different)?", "answer": "The year it is approved.  For example, if a country submits a readiness proposal in June 2021 but it is not approved until March 2022 it will be part of the USD 1 million cap for 2022."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "7. What is the usual approval timeframe from the date of proposal submission?", "answer": "The GCF Secretariat aims to process approval of all readiness grants within 90 business days from submission date.  For National Adaptation Plan (NAP)/adaptation planning proposals, the GCF Secretariat aims to approve proposals in 110 business days.  However, this does not count the time required for revisions to proposals by the Nationally Designated Authority and/or delivery partner.  On average, for regular readiness proposals, the time from submission to first tranche disbursement is 180 – 200 days."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "8. Can the Ministry of Health through the NDA contact GCF for support when developing my proposal?", "answer": "Yes, GCF encourages countries to contact their regional offices for support. You can find the contact details for the regional advisor of your country here . GCF regional focal points can provide useful context for potential proposals, including best practices and lessons learned from other countries and successful proposals. The requests for support are to come from the NDA, that’s why it is very important that the NDA communicates its agreement to submit a WHO Readiness Proposal on health as soon as possible."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "9. Another sector in my country is already developing/has already submitted a proposal for readiness funds.  Can the health sector still access readiness funds?", "answer": "NDAs may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously up to the maximum amounts specified above."}
{"topic": "/readiness-process-from-proposal-development-to-approval", "question": "10. My country is already preparing a project proposal so are we still able to access readiness funds?", "answer": "Yes, you may access readiness funds while preparing a funding proposal as long as your country has not yet accessed the full USD 1 million cap/year of available readiness funds. However, the funds cannot be used to develop a full project proposal.  Since the development and potential approval of a full proposal is a long process, accessing readiness funds may be a good way to increase health representation within the GCF portfolio."}
{"topic": "/who-as-a-gcf-delivery-partner", "question": "1. How can I contact WHO for support with climate change and health readiness proposals?", "answer": "If you are interested in developing a GCF readiness proposal on climate change and health, WHO is ready to support you. Please send a message to GCF@who.int for more information."}
{"topic": "/who-as-a-gcf-delivery-partner", "question": "2. What is WHO’s role as a Readiness Delivery Partner?", "answer": "Readiness Delivery Partners provide services such as: support to NDAs and the Ministry of Health in the development of readiness request proposals; implementation and supervision; financial management; progress reporting; and project completion and evaluation. WHO can support countries in developing readiness proposals in cooperation with NDAs and implementing readiness activities for health such as conducting a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment, developing the health component of the national adaptation plan (H-NAP), assessing the health co-benefits of mitigation, the development of a full project proposal or any other health priority issues as agreed with the NDA."}
{"topic": "/who-as-a-gcf-delivery-partner", "question": "3. Can a Readiness Delivery Partner develop and implement full GCF projects?", "answer": "Full project proposals (not readiness proposals) must be developed by a GCF Accredited Entity (AE). WHO is currently not an AE of the GCF.  Under Objective 4, WHO can assist with the development of a concept note for full project proposals for submission\r\n    to GCF and implement activities as part of a GCF-funded project. However, an AE is responsible for project proposal submission and then managing the overall project."}
{"topic": "/who-as-a-gcf-delivery-partner", "question": "4. Can we engage multiple delivery partners for a readiness project?", "answer": "No, there must be a lead delivery partner that is responsible for the project.  However, where further expertise and/or services are required, other partners may be engaged through established, transparent procurement processes."}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "Should my child wear a mask?", "answer": "Decisions about mask use in children should be driven by what is in the best interest of the child. Mask use should be flexible, so that children can continue play, education and everyday activities. These activities are an important part of child development and health. No child should be denied access to school or activities because of lack of a mask. Some countries and regions may have specific policies or recommendations in place. As always, follow the guidance provided by your country or local health department or ministry. WHO and UNICEF recommend the following: Children aged 5 years and under do not need to wear a mask because in this age group, they may not be able to properly wear a mask without help or supervision. 2. In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is spreading , children ages 6-11 years are recommended to wear a well-fitted mask in indoor settings where ventilation is poor or unknown, even if physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained; and in indoor settings that have adequate ventilation when physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained. 3. Adolescents 12 years or older should follow the same WHO recommendations for mask use as adults: A well-fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth should be worn in settings where SARS CoV-2 is spreading, regardless of vaccination status or history of prior infection, when interacting with individuals who are not members of their household: in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained in indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained; or in outdoor settings where physical distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained. As much as possible, it is important that children of all ages keep their hands clean when putting on and taking off their mask. A safe environment should be created for children who are not able to tolerate a mask, including requirements for caregivers, teachers or other adults interacting with the child to wear a mask and to be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to national vaccination policies."}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "My child is under 5 years old. Should they wear a mask?", "answer": "In general, children aged 5 years and under do not need to wear masks. However, there may be times when caregivers will choose to put a mask on a child – for example, if the child has contact with a person who is at a high risk of developing severe disease or is around someone who is ill. Children of this age should not wear masks for a long duration or without supervision."}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "My child has disabilities. Should they wear a mask?", "answer": "Children with cognitive or respiratory impairments, developmental disorders, disabilities or other specific health conditions who experience difficulties wearing a mask should not be required to do so. The individual decision for a child to wear a mask should be discussed in consultation with the child's medical provider where possible. A safe environment should be created for children who are not able to tolerate a mask, including requirements for caregivers, teachers or other adults interacting with the child to wear a mask and to be vaccinated against COVID-19 according to national vaccination policies"}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "My child has a medical condition that compromises their immune system. Should they wear a mask?", "answer": "The use of a medical mask is recommended for children with a higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19. This includes children with underlying noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression, HIV, obesity, mental disorders and cancer."}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "What type of mask should my child wear?", "answer": "Children should wear a well-fitted mask that overs the nose, mouth and chin . There are three types of masks that WHO recommends for the public*: reusable non-medical masks that comply with standards disposable medical masks other types of reusable non-medical masks, including homemade multi-layered (fabric) masks are acceptable when other options are not available. *More on the types of masks, how to choose them, and how to wear them is available here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks"}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "How should children wear a mask?", "answer": "Adults and children should follow the same principles for safe mask wearing. Some children may not be able to properly wear a mask without help or supervision. Parents or caregivers who help children with masks should be prepared to talk about mask safety\r\n    and help children understand how to wear masks properly. If you are helping a child to put on or take off a mask, be sure to follow the same steps when you put on and take off your own mask. Children should be encouraged to clean their hands before putting on their mask and after taking it off and to wear a well-fitted mask that covers the nose, mouth and chin. It is important to not share masks with others. More information, including videos on how to put on, take off and care for a mask, can be found here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks"}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "Should my child wear a mask at home?", "answer": "Your child’s health is a priority, and there may be times when wearing a mask at home is the safest thing to do. If you have visitors, outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings. If visitors come into your home, it may be best for everyone to wear a mask if ventilation is poor or if physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be maintained. Children who have symptoms of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask at home when they are in shared spaces, as long as they can tolerate it. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a medical mask. For more information refer to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Home care for families and caregivers"}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "Should teachers or other adults interacting with children wear a mask?", "answer": "In areas where SARS-CoV-2 is spreading, adults under the age of 60 interacting with children should wear a well-fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth when they are: in indoor settings where ventilation is known to be poor or cannot be assessed, or the ventilation system is not properly maintained, regardless of whether or not physical distancing of at least 1 meter can be maintained; or in indoor settings that have adequate ventilation if physical      distancing of at least 1 meter cannot be maintained. Adults aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer, should wear a medical mask due to their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/q-a-children-and-masks-related-to-covid-19", "question": "Should children wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities?", "answer": "Children do not need to wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing, as it may affect their breathing. When organizing sporting activities for children, it is important to encourage all other public health measures: Choose outside venues over indoor ones. If gatherings must be held indoors, open windows to ensure good ventilation. Maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others and limit the number of children playing together. Provide access to hand hygiene facilities and encourage children to use them."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "What is GISRS?", "answer": "The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) is a global network that encompasses more than 150 laboratories in more than 120 Member States. The network provides the expertise needed to monitor and rapidly respond to the continuous threat posed by seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic influenza viruses. GISRS provides detailed information on circulating seasonal influenza viruses, as well as immediate response to the influenza pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009, to threats caused by animal influenza viruses and, most recently, to the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "How did the devastating impact of influenza lead to the founding of GISRS?", "answer": "The importance of influenza surveillance had been promoted by the scientific community in the years prior to the establishment of WHO. The catastrophic 1918 influenza pandemic alerted the world to the deadly threat to humankind posed by influenza. Over a decade later, researchers succeeded in isolating influenza viruses – first from pigs in 1931 and then from humans in 1933. Most of the researchers working on influenza during those early years had witnessed the devastating effects of the Spanish flu pandemic and they all agreed that such a global pandemic could arise again. In 1951, international experts recognized the need for global coordination of influenza research and identified the main objects for a WHO Expert Committee for influenza. The first meeting of this WHO Expert Committee for influenza, convened in Geneva in September 1952, marks the beginning of the WHO influenza surveillance network. Initially called Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN), the network was renamed to Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System in 2011 upon the adoption by the World Health Assembly, of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework) for the Sharing of Influenza Viruses and Access to Vaccines and Other Benefits."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "How has the GISRS network expanded over the past 70 years?", "answer": "Ever since its foundation, GISRS has continued to expand. From 25 countries in 1952, who had some influenza surveillance in place and were able to report data to WHO, to 127 countries, areas or territories 70 years later. The network now includes 158 institutions, including 148 National Influenza Centers recognized by WHO in 124 WHO Member States, seven WHO Collaborating Centres , four Essential Regulatory Laboratories , and 13 H5 Reference Laboratories ."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "Why is GISRS’s role still so vital 70 years since it was founded?", "answer": "There are a number of reasons: Influenza continues to be a serious global health problem that impacts all countries: as many as 1 billion people get influenza every year, there are three to five million severe cases, and there are up to 650 000 influenza-related respiratory deaths. Influenza viruses constantly evolve into new variants and spread rapidly. GISRS tests over 3 million specimens every year (2014-2019), and in fact, this surged to 6.7 million tests annually for influenza and 44.2 million tests for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and 2021. GISRS shares around 20 000 influenza virus samples every year to WHO Collaborating Centres. GISRS updates the weekly influenza situation based on laboratory and disease surveillance reporting through the FluNet and FluID systems, and distributes timely risk assessments and alerts to countries. GISRS has been recommending suitable viruses for inclusion in annual seasonal vaccines since 1973 and biannual recommendations or the northern and southern hemispheres since 1998. GISRS played a key role in the avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak in 1997 and its re-emergence in 2003, SARS-CoV-1 in 2002, the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, and the A(H7N9) emergency in 2013 in partnership with organizations in the animal sector and other international agencies. GISRS also serves as a critical resource for countries handling non-influenza emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. GISRS is developing into a stronger global system, built upon existing influenza infrastructure, to achieve integrated surveillance and response systems not only for influenza but also other respiratory viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "Why and how does GISRS update influenza vaccine composition every year?", "answer": "In contrast to many other vaccines, influenza vaccines need to be evaluated and updated regularly because circulating influenza viruses evolve continuously. WHO convenes technical consultations twice a year (February and September) with an advisory group of experts from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyze global influenza surveillance data generated by the GISRS to determine if current seasonal influenza vaccine composition need to be updated. This considerable task requires a range of activities including but not limited to: reviewing surveillance data, the genetic and antigenic characterization of viruses, and conducting human serology studies with influenza virus vaccines. Based on these data and the availability of candidate vaccine viruses, the advisory group decide if vaccine composition for the next influenza season need to be updated, and which vaccine viruses need to be replaced by which new ones. Further information can be found here ."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "What is the role of GISRS in an influenza pandemic?", "answer": "GISRS plays a leading role in responses to an influenza pandemic. The global network conducts year-round surveillance of influenza, monitoring influenza activity and virus evolution, detecting human infections with zoonotic influenza viruses of pandemic potential, conducting rapid and timely risk assessment to guide public health responses. Such continuous operations of GISRS serve as the foundation for influenza pandemic response. With the declaration of an influenza pandemic, the GISRS response intensifies through highly collaborative operations of individual members of GISRS including National Influenza Centres, WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories, with WHO being the coordinating body. In particular, GISRS develops valid laboratory tests along with testing protocols and algorithms for detection of the novel virus; monitors global spread of the novel viruses, fully characterize the novel viruses, develop candidate vaccine viruses and reagents, and conduct rapid and timely risk assessment to guide public health responses and pandemic vaccine preparation."}
{"topic": "/gisrs-70th-anniversary-faq", "question": "How has GISRS been a foundational and continuing support in the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "GISRS has made significant contributions in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic from the start. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, GISRS network has been at the forefront of a concerted global and national response for the detection and containment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In many countries, National Influenza Centres of GISRS readily became primary hubs for national COVID-19 testing and response. Importantly, GISRS has leveraged the existing influenza surveillance system to conduct SARS-CoV-2 sentinel surveillance. GISRS integrated sentinel surveillance of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 informs public health response to the two viruses and associated diseases at the same time. Moreover, GISAID, a long-term partner of GISRS, published the first SARS-CoV-2 sequence data hours after it became available."}
{"topic": "/food-fortification", "question": "Why should food be fortified?", "answer": "Fortification has been identified as one of the most cost-effective nutrition interventions available, particularly for low- and middle-income countries. Fortification of commonly used food vehicles provides an opportunity for increasing nutrient intake during infancy and for populations at risk of deficiencies without any side effects for the general population. It is a “win-win”."}
{"topic": "/food-fortification", "question": "What are the health impacts of food fortification?", "answer": "Food fortification with multiple micronutrients may reduce anaemia, iron deficiency anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies (iron, vitamin A, vitamin B2 and vitamin B6) as well as some motor and cognitive outcomes. Micronutrients’ fortification may also improve child growth measures. Fortification of wheat flour with folic acid may reduce the risk of neural tube defects and may increase erythrocyte and serum/plasma folate concentrations. Fortification of wheat flour with iron may reduce anaemia in the general population. Staple foods may be fortified with vitamin D for the prevention and reduction of nutritional rickets. Fortification of foods with zinc may improve the serum zinc status. There are no reported side effects associated with single or micronutrients fortification."}
{"topic": "/food-fortification", "question": "Basic principles about food fortification", "answer": "Fortification should be part of a comprehensive micronutrient deficiency control strategy that sets clear and achievable goals to assess progress across the lifespan of the program and ensures complementarity with other programs if needed. The most widely used vehicles for fortification are among the most commonly consumed foods, including oils and fats, milk, sugar, salt, rice, wheat, or maize flour. Some factors related to food fortification such as level of fortification; bioavailability of fortificants; and amount of fortified food consumed have a significant effect on health. The choice of vehicle for fortification requires information on the consumption pattern (or potential consumption pattern) in diverse population groups, and particularly the proportion of the food vehicle consumed that is fortifiable."}
{"topic": "/food-fortification", "question": "Lessons learned about food fortification", "answer": "Food fortification leads to rapid improvement in the micronutrient status of a population, and at a reasonable cost, especially if advantage is taken from existing technology and local distribution networks. In many cases, when multiple deficiencies coexists, food fortification with multiple micronutrients appears relatively mor beneficial and should be considered. Challenges such as choosing appropriate fortification vehicles, reaching target populations, avoiding overconsumption in nontarget groups, and monitoring nutritional status are relevant to all countries because they occur everywhere where there is an attempt to fortify foods to optimize intake and nutritional status. Continuous production and monitoring of quality fortified foods are essential."}
{"topic": "/food-fortification", "question": "Implementing mandatory versus voluntary fortification", "answer": "Mandatory and voluntary regulation in food fortification may provide different levels of certainty over time that a particular category of food will contain a pre-determined amount of a micronutrient. The higher the level of certainty provided, the more likely fortification delivers a sustained source of fortified food for consumption by the relevant population group, and, in turn, a public health benefit. Mandatory fortification occurs when governments legally oblige food producers to fortify particular foods or categories of foods with specified micronutrients. The decision about mandatory or voluntary fortification depends on many factors including (but not limited to) the population groups affected by the deficiency, populations at risk of receiving excessive amounts of a particular micronutrient, the number of big, centralized industries producing the fortified item, the cost of the process, ongoing fortification or other nutrition programmes in the country, the fortification scenario in neighboring countries, the political implications….) Globally, mandatory regulations are most often applied to the fortification of food with micronutrients such as iodine, iron, vitamin A, and increasingly folic acid, as proof of deficiency is more widely available. Of these, the iodization of salt is probably the most widely adopted form of mandatory mass fortification. In deciding the precise form of mandatory fortification regulation, governments are responsible for ensuring that the combination of the food vehicle and the fortificants will be both efficacious and effective for the target group, yet safe for target and non-target groups alike. Food vehicles range from basic commodities, such as various types of flour, sugar and salt which are available on the retail market for use by consumers as well as ingredients of processed foods, to processed foods that are fortified at the point of manufacture/use. Voluntary fortification occurs when a food manufacturer freely chooses to fortify particular foods in response to permission given in food law, or under special circumstances, is encouraged by government to do so. Voluntary fortification is usually motivated by industry and consumers seeking to obtain possible health benefits through an increase in micronutrient intakes. Occasionally, however, government provides the driving force. However, it is important that governments exercise an appropriate degree of control over voluntary fortification through food laws or other cooperative arrangements, such as industry codes of practice. The degree of control should at least be commensurate with the inherent level of risk. Regulatory controls of this nature should also ensure the safety of fortified foods for all consumers, as well as provide opportunities for industry to produce fortified foods that offer consumers nutritional and/or other health benefits. The potential benefits may be demonstrable or indicated as potential or plausible by generally accepted scientific data. It is very important to maintain a tight control and monitoring of ongoing fortification efforts, since mandatory and voluntary fortification of different food items is theoretically feasible simultaneously."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "What is a technology transfer hub?", "answer": "Technology transfer in biomedical research and development is the transfer of a medical technology from the originator to a secondary user, allowing that user to manufacture the technology and sell it on usually new markets. It can also include transfer of knowledge, manufacturing practices and intellectual property. Typically, technology transfer is bilateral – from the originator of the technology to a recipient. A technology transfer hub in contrast, is multilateral. It brings together in one single place all the elements needed to establish the technology (know-how, data, formula, intellectual property and in many cases training) and then transfers the fully validated manufacturing process to multiple secondary users. Multilateral technology transfer hubs are needed when there is a request from multiple recipients to receive the technology and when there is limited interest in bilateral agreements."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "Why did WHO establish the mRNA technology transfer hub?", "answer": "By early 2021, production and supply constraints, vaccine hoarding by wealthy countries and companies prioritizing sales to governments that could pay the highest price had made it clear that low- and middle-income countries would be pushed to the end of the queue for receiving COVID-19 vaccines. While WHO continuously advocated for equitable sharing of vaccines through the COVAX Facility, and for sharing of technology through bilateral and multilateral agreements (i.e. through the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool), the initiative of establishing an mRNA technology transfer hub surfaced as a valid strategy to increase mRNA vaccine production capacity in under-served regions, and thus promote regional health security. The aim is to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to produce mRNA vaccines at scale and according to WHO Good Manufacturing Practices."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "Have any mRNA hubs been established, and how many are planned?", "answer": "In April 2021, WHO issued a call for expressions of interest to companies wishing to host an mRNA technology transfer hub. In June 2021, WHO announced that it had selected a South African consortium to run the hub, which will serve all low- and middle-income countries. No additional mRNA technology transfer hubs are planned. The selected consortium comprises Afrigen Biologics, the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) and Biovac, a South African vaccine producer. Within this consortium, Afrigen is the entity mandated to establish mRNA vaccine production technology, SAMRC is providing the research and Biovac is the first manufacturing “spoke”. The hub has already established mRNA vaccine production at laboratory scale and is currently scaling up and validating production at commercial scale. Training of the recipients (the spokes) will begin in March 2022."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "How many spokes will there be?", "answer": "In September 2021, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) announced agreements with two centres to establish regional mRNA manufacturer spokes - in Brazil, with the Bio-Manguinhos Institute of Technology on Immunobiologicals at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, and in Argentina with Sinergium Biotech. In November 2021, WHO had an open call for Expressions of Interest from other potential manufacturing spokes. Announcements of these are expected in February."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "How will the South African mRNA hub work?", "answer": "Afrigen Biologics will develop the vaccine and produce batches for clinical trials. Researchers will initially use publicly available information on an existing vaccine for which raw ingredients are commercially available as a basis to develop a first candidate and validate the process. With support from South African researchers and biotech companies, Afrigen will, in parallel, proceed to develop a vaccine more suited to the geographical contexts in which it will be used – i.e. with fewer storage constraints – and cheaper to produce. Once a vaccine has been successfully developed, the spokes will mass-produce the vaccine for national and regional use. Each spoke will need to seek approval in their jurisdiction, which will be facilitated by the sharing of the full pre-clinical and clinical data from the hub."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "Who will hold the intellectual property rights to the vaccines developed by the hub?", "answer": "The South African hub will initially use publicly available information about an existing COVID-19 vaccine to replicate the technology. This technology was chosen because the originator company has publicly stated that it would not enforce patent rights during the pandemic. The hub, in collaboration with South African academic groups and biotech companies outside of South Africa is developing second generation mRNA vaccine technologies. Intellectual property resulting from this activity will be held by the inventors but will be made freely available to the spokes in the hub. The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) – which co-leads the hub initiative with WHO – will assist with its expertise in intellectual property management by providing intellectual property analysis and defining and negotiating terms and conditions of eventual agreements."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "How long before the vaccines produced by the hub can be administered?", "answer": "Clinical trials are expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2022. A first approval could potentially be in 2024. The spokes in countries receiving the technology should be able to secure approval shortly thereafter."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "Why does the hub focus specifically on mRNA?", "answer": "There are several factors that make mRNA technology a good focus for the technology transfer hub: mRNA vaccines have proved highly efficacious against COVID-19, and so far against new variants. mRNA technologies can potentially be adapted to vaccines for other diseases and also to treatments. Investing in training for use of this technology will have long-term benefits for the regions where production will be based, most of which are currently under-served by the global pharmaceutical market. Though a relatively new technology, mRNA is easy to share, develop and adapt to new variants. Companies that can produce quality medical products can adapt their manufacturing to this technology."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "How do the announcements by Moderna, Biontech, Providence and others for their plans to establish mRNA vaccine production in Africa affect the WHO hub?", "answer": "Numerous biotech companies have announced plans to establish mRNA vaccine production on the African continent. WHO welcomes all initiatives aiming to expand quality biomedical manufacturing in Africa and other under-served regions. These bilateral partnerships are good contributions to the overall effort and WHO stands ready to support all countries involved at their request The mRNA hub in South Africa has more of a global approach. It is serving not only Africa but the entire world. To date, over 20 countries have requested access to the hub’s technology transfer."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "How is WHO encouraging scale-up of manufacturing capacity in under-served regions?", "answer": "Within the broader context of promoting local production, technology transfer alone is insufficient. Two major barriers need to be overcome – the low availability of a trained workforce and weak regulatory capacity. WHO is addressing these gaps by establishing biomanufacturing workforce training hubs and working with the WHO Academy to ensure that regulatory and biomanufacturing training meet countries’ needs and objectives."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "How will WHO ensure that regulatory authorities in low- and middle-income countries will be able to provide quality assurance for these new products?", "answer": "Regulatory systems play a key role in assuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of medical products and in licensing them so that they may be made available to populations. WHO is working with multiple regulatory authorities in countries that stand to benefit from the hub by evaluating them through its global benchmarking tool (GBT). The tool and benchmarking methodology enable WHO and regulatory authorities to identify strengths and gaps and build improvement plans. Once improvements have been made, the regulatory authority is assessed according to its maturity level on a scale of 1 (existence of some elements of a regulatory system) to 4 (operating at advanced level of performance and continuous improvement). WHO intends to use the GBT to evaluate and publicly designate WHO-listed authorities (WLAs) that have been objectively documented to perform at maturity levels 3 and 4. Several countries involved in the hub are at an advanced stage of being assessed for their maturity level."}
{"topic": "/mrna-technology-transfer-hub", "question": "Will the transfer of mRNA technology be sufficient to ensure regional/national health security?", "answer": "While the initiative will contribute to regional capacity to produce vaccines, we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic that supply chains are a critical barrier to national and regional responses. During the early phase of the pandemic, supplies of key materials for vaccine production, such as glass vials, rubber stoppers or fermented bags were not reaching regions lacking their own capacities to produce them. For mRNA, the list of essential raw materials is long and could be a barrier to local production. WHO is exploring opportunities to facilitate regional production of some of these ingredients."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe?", "answer": "There are strict precautions in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy. Unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time – to meet the urgent need for these vaccines while maintaining high safety standards. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Through that process, we ascertain that they remain safe for use around the world. Read more: Safety of COVID-19 vaccines."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "How does WHO ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective?", "answer": "The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large Phase III clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have already completed their Phase III trials and are being used globally, and many other vaccine candidates are being developed and are still in the trial phase. Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence are required by WHO for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers it for emergency use listing. An external panel of experts convened by WHO (the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) , analyses the results from clinical trials, along with evidence on the disease, age groups affected, risk factors for disease, programmatic use and other information. SAGE then recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used. In addition to reviewing data for regulatory purposes, the evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how the vaccines should be used. The WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) monitors how approved vaccines behave in the real world and to identify any signals of adverse events following immunization. GACVS is an independent group of experts providing authoritative, scientific advice to WHO on vaccine safety issues of global or regional concern. Read more: Safety of COVID-19 vaccines."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "What systems are in place to monitor vaccine safety?", "answer": "Vaccine safety monitoring is critical at national, regional, and global levels. After any vaccine is introduced, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, national advisory committees and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that arise are then evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS) in conjunction with the relevant national authorities. As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO is supporting the implementation of safety monitoring systems for COVID-19 vaccines in every country. Read more: How the safety of vaccines is monitored."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "How will WHO inform the public about suspected or confirmed serious adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "Suspected safety events officially reported to WHO go through a series of rapid verification steps involving the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). WHO then shares the results of these evaluations on its website and publishes the results of any assessments. WHO also coordinates with local, regional, and national health officials to investigate vaccine safety concerns and advise on next steps. Additional vaccine safety information is also made available through the Vaccine Safety Net , a global network of websites providing reliable information on vaccine safety that have been verified by WHO."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Under what circumstances should a COVID-19 vaccine be recalled?", "answer": "In rare situations where a serious adverse reaction is suspected to be related to the vaccine itself, the vaccine may be temporarily suspended from use while the situation is assessed. Investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures will be put in place. WHO works closely with vaccine manufacturers, health officials, researchers, and other partners to monitor any safety concerns and potential side effects. Vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to safety issues are rare. Recalls are generally associated with problems identified during the monitoring of batches of vaccines through quality control systems, stability studies and reports from the field, including cold chain issues where some vaccines have not been stored at the right conditions and so are no longer safe or effective. In this case, people who have received a vaccine from that batch may need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected. This is why vaccines are so closely monitored – to ensure that any issues with their production, storage or use can be rapidly identified and resolved."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "Like with any vaccine, some people will experience mild to moderate side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19. This is a normal sign that the body is developing protection. Side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, chills, diarrhoea and pain or redness at the injection site. Not everyone will experience side effects. Most side effects go away within a few days on their own. You can manage any side effects with rest, plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain and fever, if needed. If you are worried that the side effects that you are experiencing are unusual, if the pain in the arm where you got the injection gets worse after 24 hours or your side effects don’t go away in a few days, contact your healthcare provider for advice. More serious or long-lasting side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are possible but extremely rare. If you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use to detect and respond to rare adverse events. Read more: The side effects of COVID-19 vaccines."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Does having side effects mean that the vaccine is working? What does having no side effects mean?", "answer": "The vaccine stimulates your immune system to protect you from the virus. This process can sometimes cause side effects like fever, chills or headache, but not everyone will experiences any side effect. The presence or magnitude of the reaction you may have vaccination does not predict or reflect your immune response to the vaccine. You do not have to have side effects in order to be protected. Read more: Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "What should I do if I think my side effects are unusual?", "answer": "If you are worried about your side effects, contact your healthcare provider and let them know about your recent vaccination."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Is there a link between COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions?", "answer": "In very rare cases, some people may experience an allergic reaction after being vaccinated against COVID-19. A severe allergic reaction – such as anaphylaxis – is a very rare side effect of any vaccine. If you have a history of allergic reactions, talk to your healthcare provider before you get vaccinated. They will be able to give you advice. In some cases, precautions will need to be taken for people who have known allergies to previous doses of the vaccine or known components of the vaccine. Healthcare workers administering COVID-19 vaccines should be trained to recognise and treat serious allergic reactions. This is why people being vaccinated against COVID-19 will be asked to stay at the vaccination site for a period of time following their injection, to ensure that anyone experiencing an allergic reaction can receive prompt treatment. Reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination (including allergic reactions) are closely monitored by national authorities and international bodies, including WHO for the early detection of serious side effects."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "What happens if a serious adverse event is reported after vaccination?", "answer": "As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that are used in immunization programmes. If a serious health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following receipt of a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Health problems following vaccination are most often found to be coincidental and entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported, or administered. Errors related to the delivery of the vaccine can be prevented by better training health workers and strengthening supply chains. The results of the investigation will then inform next steps. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is the top priority of the World Health Organization. Find out more about how the safety of vaccines is monitored."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Is it safe to mix-and-match different COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "It is safe for you to receive two different COVID-19 vaccines for your first and second dose. This is sometimes called mixing and matching vaccines, or a heterologous vaccine schedule. WHO considers two doses of any WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines to be a complete primary series. See the full list of COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL here . By mixing and matching vaccines, countries are able to maximise vaccine impact in the event of constrained or limited supply. People over 60 who have received two doses of Sinovac and Sinopharm can also be given a third dose to help boost their immunity, once a high level of coverage of the priority groups has been achieved. SAGE has stated that Pfizer or AstraZeneca can be used for the third dose if the original vaccine is not available. Further trials are underway to understand more about mixed doses, which will inform any future changes to WHO’s recommendations."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Are mRNA vaccines safe? If they’re based on new technology, how can we be sure?", "answer": "The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines produce an immune response that has high efficacy against disease. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades, including in the contexts of Zika, rabies, and influenza vaccines. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. Find out more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines and the safety of COVID-19 vaccines."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Is there a risk of heart inflammation (myocarditis or pericarditis) from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "Globally, mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna have been used to protect millions of people against COVID-19. A significant amount of data is available from both clinical trials and country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild side effects are expected after vaccination; these are a normal sign that the body is developing protection. There have been reports of very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) following the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, including infections, viruses, medicines and environmental factors. The currently available data suggests that there is also a potential relationship between these symptoms and mRNA vaccines. Research is underway to understand more. Cases have been mostly reported in younger men aged 12 – 29 (40.6 cases of myocarditis per million second doses) compared to females of the same age group (4.2 cases per million second doses)[1]. The symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis are generally mild. Fast treatment with medication and rest can help to avoid long term heart damage and death. If you experience new and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath or have a racing or pounding heartbeat within a few days of vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. The benefits of these vaccines greatly outweigh the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis by preventing deaths and hospitalisations due to COVID-19. For more information, please read the updated guidance from the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). Click here to see an infographic on myocarditis and pericarditis."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Do the COVID-19 Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines cause blood clots?", "answer": "Globally, COVID-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Johnson &Johnson/Janssen have been used to protect millions of people. Data is available from both clinical trials and preliminary data from country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild to moderate side effects such as fever, muscle and head aches, soreness around the injection site and tiredness are expected to affect some people after vaccination. These are a normal indications that the body is developing protection. There have been reports of very rare but serious cases of blood clots accompanied by low platelet counts (known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)) occurring 3 to 30 days after vaccination with COVID-19 non-replicant adenovirus vector-based vaccines (such as the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines). Read more about the different types of COVID-19 vaccines . With the AstraZeneca vaccine, as of 15 July 2021, the data shows that these symptoms occur in about four to six people out of every million vaccinated (this figure varies based on age, sex and geographical location)[2}. Younger adults appear to be at higher risk than older adults. More research is underway to understand more about how people may be differently affected. With the Janssen vaccine, as of the 7 May 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed 28 reports of TTS out of a total of more than eight million people vaccinated[3]. It is possible that that there a causal link between the vaccine and these symptoms, but more data is needed. TTS is very rare; however, blood clotting is a common health problem caused by many factors. Not all clots that occur after vaccination with Astra Zeneca or the Janssen vaccine will be due to TTS. The risk of blood clots is far higher from COVID-19 itself than from either vaccine. If you experience a new, severe, persistent headache, blurred vision, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, leg swelling or unusual skin bruising and shortness of breath between three to 30 days following vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. WHO has published interim guidance for clinical case management of TTS following vaccination . The benefits of the COVID-19 Astra Zeneca and Janssen vaccines are far greater than the very small risk of TTS. As well as protecting you from severe disease and death due to COVID-19, being vaccinated can protect you against complications from ‘long COVID’, provide some protection for your close contacts and community by reducing transmission, and can reduce the risk of severe disease from some variant strains. WHO recommends that these vaccines continue to be used to protect priority groups.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety", "question": "Do the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccines cause Guillain-Barré syndrome?", "answer": "Globally, vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Johnson &Johnson/Janssen have been used to protect millions of people against COVID-19. Data is available from both clinical trials and preliminary data from country surveillance programmes on their efficacy and safety. Some mild to moderate side effects such as fever, muscle and head aches, soreness around the injection site and tiredness are expected to affect some people after vaccination. These are a normal indications that the body is developing protection. There have been very rare reports of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring within 42 days of vaccination with the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines (adenovirus vector vaccines). Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the nerves, causing muscle weakness, tingling and/or loss of sensation in the arms and/or legs. Most people affected recover fully. Although these cases happened after vaccination, it is not yet possible to tell whether they were related to or caused by the vaccines, or if they were coincidental. The benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 greatly outweigh any possible risk. As of the 27 June, the European Medicines Agency had received reports of 227 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the European Union following vaccination with AstraZeneca. Around 51.4 million doses of Vaxzevria (the brand of AstraZeneca produced in Europe) had been administered within the European Union by 20 June 2021. For the Janssen vaccine, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reported that 100 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome had been reported through the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System in the United States of America (USA) as of 30 June, with approximately 12.2 million doses of the Janssen vaccine administered. Outside of the European Union and the USA, cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have also been reported; however further investigation is needed to determine whether the rate has increased from usual levels. Guillain-Barré syndrome has many causes, such as bacterial or viral infections, surgery or vaccine administration. It can also be caused by COVID-19. In 2011, it was estimated that the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome in Europe and Northern America was 0.8 to 1.9 cases out of every 100 000 people [4] . It can affect people of all ages but is more common in adults and in males. Most people recover fully even from the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome; however, it is potentially life threatening and some people affected may need intensive care. If you experience any of the following symptoms within 42 days of vaccination, contact your healthcare provider immediately: Difficulty walking Difficulty with facial movements,      including breathing, speaking, chewing or swallowing Double vision or being unable to move your      eyes Difficulty with bladder or bowel control Weakness or tingling sensations in the      legs, arms and face The benefits of the COVID-19 Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines are far greater than the very small risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. As well as protecting you from severe disease and death due to COVID-19, being vaccinated can protect you against complications from ‘long COVID’, provide some protection for your close contacts and community by reducing transmission, and can reduce the risk of severe disease from variant strains. COVID-19 disease can also cause Guillain-Barré syndrome. WHO recommends that these vaccines continue to be used to protect priority groups. For more information, read the Statement of the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) COVID-19 subcommittee on reports of Guillain-Barré ."}

Who can access the GCF Readiness Programme?", "answer": "All developing country parties to the UNFCCC can access the Readiness Programme. At least 50 per cent of the readiness support is intended for particularly vulnerable countries, including Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and African States."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "2. How much funding is available under the GCF Readiness Programme?", "answer": "The GCF Readiness Programme provides: Up to USD 1 million per country per year for support related to institutional capacity building, coordination, policy and planning, and programming for investment. Of this overall amount, NDAs may request up to USD 300,000 per year in direct support to help establish or strengthen a NDA or focal point to deliver on the Fund’s requirements. A maximum of USD 100,000 can be used for NDA-led stakeholder\r\n            meetings. Activities under Objectives 1, 2, 4 and 5 can be proposed for this funding bucket. While the maximum funding available is USD 1 million per year, projects may be implemented in timeframes longer than 12 months (and will only be counted against\r\n            the funding cap for the year the proposal was approved). Up to USD 3 million per country for the formulation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and/or other adaptation planning processes. This may include support for subnational adaptation plans and/or sectoral adaptation planning processes\r\n        including H-NAPs. Activities under Objective 3 can be proposed for this funding bucket. These two caps work independently of each other. The USD 1 million cap is applied on approvals per calendar year, not implementation period. For example, in 2020, a country may be approved for Grant A of USD 1 million with an 18-month implementation term\r\n    ending in 2021. That country would not be able to access another readiness grant under the USD 1 million cap system in 2020. However, in 2021, they could submit Grant B for up to USD 1 million for an implementation term concurrent, at least in part,\r\n    with Grant A."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "2. What can WHO do as a GCF Readiness Delivery Partner?", "answer": "Readiness Delivery Partners provide services such as: support to NDAs in the development of readiness request proposals; implementation and supervision; financial management; progress reporting; and project completion and evaluation. WHO can support countries in developing readiness proposals in cooperation with NDAs and implementing readiness activities for health such as conducting a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment, developing the health component of the national adaptation plan (H-NAP), assessing the health co-benefits of mitigation, the development of a full project proposal or any other health priority issues as agreed with the NDA."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "3. Can a Readiness Delivery Partner develop and implement full GCF projects?", "answer": "Full project proposals (not readiness proposals) must be developed by a GCF Accredited Entity (AE). WHO is currently not an AE of the GCF.  WHO can assist with the development of full project proposals for submission to GCF (although not as part of a readiness proposal) and implement activities as part of a GCF-funded project, however, an AE is responsible for project proposal submission and then managing the overall project."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "3. Is it possible to apply for both the USD 1 million per year and the readiness funds of USD 3 million per year at the same time with different readiness delivery partners?", "answer": "Yes, it is.  The USD 3 million is a one-time funding allocation available for NAP-related activities (including the development of a health component of a NAP (H-NAP))."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "4. What is the funding cap for WHO as a Readiness Delivery Partner?", "answer": "Currently, there is no funding cap for WHO as a Delivery Partner. Any GCF Readiness projects for which WHO is a delivery partner will be subject to the USD 3 million per country cap on support for adaptation planning (Objective 3) and the annual cap of USD 1 million per country."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "5. Who needs to submit the GCF readiness proposal?", "answer": "The readiness proposal must be submitted by the country’s NDA and as such, it is very important to have the NDA’s support at an early stage, ideally at proposal conceptualization.  It is equally important to ensure that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or equivalent Government department) and other relevant Government counterparts. For proposals in which WHO is the delivery partner, WHO Headquarters (HQ), specifically the Assistant Director General, Healthier Populations ( GCF@who.int ), is the appropriate contact point for section 1.4 of the readiness template.  Other relevant WHO contacts may also be added in section 1.4 in addition to HQ .  Please also include villalobose@who.int in the list of additional emails to be copied."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "6. Does a No Objection Letter (NOL) need to be submitted with the GCF Readiness Proposal?", "answer": "No, The GCF Board policies do not require NoLs for Readiness proposals. The act of Proposal submission is effectively taken as NDA consent since NDAs rather than Delivery partners are responsible for submitting the proposal. Some countries may submit\r\n    NoL type letter, but this may be due to National protocols rather than GCF policies."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "7. Are the Letters of Financial Support required for regional or multi-country proposals separate from the No Objection Letters?", "answer": "Yes, Letters of Financial Support are separate from NoLs."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "8. If WHO is the readiness delivery partner who will receive the funds?", "answer": "WHO HQ will receive funds directly from the GCF. The funding will then be transferred to WHO Regions or countries accordingly."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "9. What are the regulations for using funds to support project-related staff from WHO", "answer": "Regarding the use of funds to support existing WHO staff under the outcome budget, this is allowable with the following circumstances: WHO staff must have clearly defined roles in the execution of activities. This is especially true if the budget for the same output/activity includes the use of consultants and/or firms. WHO staff technical responsibilities must be separate from those eligible to be charged against the Project Management Cost (PMC). That is, WHO must ensure these are not generic costs related to programme management or implementation oversight (such as quality assurance on deliverables, managing consultants, reporting, stakeholder engagement, etc.) Detailed information is provided on p. 26 of the Guidebook, and also the Annex to the GCF Board decision on the policy on fees (p. 50). Section 6.2 must contain a thorough explanation of what each consultant, firm, and/or WHO staff will perform under each activity they are budgeted against. This section should indicate, for activities that will have more than one staff/consultant/firm budgeted, who is leading and who is supporting the work."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "10. What are the regulations for using funds to support project-related staff from partners (e.g. Ministry of Health)?", "answer": "GCF has strict regulations regarding the transfer of funds to project partners. Any transfer of funds from the Delivery Partner to second a staff member of national government or from a partner agency to work on grant activities will require the three following conditions: a) The staff member is not on the payroll of the government/receives no government salary during the grant term; b) The staff member was procured under the approved procurement policies of the delivery partner, and; c) The staff member has specifically detailed role and responsibilities in the outcome budget and explained in Section 6.2."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "11. Is it possible to use Direct Financial Cooperation (DFC) arrangements during project implementation?", "answer": "Direct Financial Cooperation (DFC) arrangements are not allowed under the GCF process. This could only be allowed if: A financial management capacity assessment has been performed on the sub-grantee (e.g. Ministry of Health of Health) confirming that they meet the basic requirements to handle GCF funding; The proposal specifies the activities and budget lines that will be implemented by the sub-grantee, and; The proposal confirms that a legal contract between the delivery partner and the sub-grantee will be agreed wherein the sub-grantee assumes all compliance responsibilities from GCF (e.g. WHO “passes down” such responsibilities to the Ministry of Health)."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "12. Who has responsibility for the implementation of approved readiness activities?", "answer": "The role of a delivery partner of any approved readiness activities is the implementation of the said activities. Hence, if WHO is the selected and approved readiness delivery partner for that specific proposal, WHO will be responsible for ensuring the activities are implemented as outlined in the proposal. However, to ensure effective delivery of proposal activities it is crucial that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or equivalent Government department) and the NDA."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "13. Does the funding for a readiness proposal count towards the funding limit of the year the proposal is submitted or the year that it is approved (if they are different)?", "answer": "The year it is approved.  For example, if a country submits a readiness proposal in June 2021 but it is not approved until March 2022 it will be part of the USD 1 million cap for 2022."}
{"topic": "/accessing-implementing-gcf-readiness-funds", "question": "14. What is the usual approval timeframe from the date of proposal submission?", "answer": "The GCF Secretariat aims to process approval of all readiness grants within 90 business days from submission date.  For National Adaptation Plan (NAP)/adaptation planning proposals, the GCF Secretariat aims to approve proposals in 110 business days.  However, this does not count the time required for revisions to proposals by the Nationally Designated Authority and/or delivery partner.  On average, for regular readiness proposals, the time from submission to first tranche disbursement is 180 – 200 days."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "What is ventilation and how can it prevent COVID-19 from spreading?", "answer": "Ventilation is the process of bringing fresh, outdoor air inside and letting indoor air outside in order to maintain or improve air quality. The risk of getting COVID-19 infection is increased in crowded and poorly ventilated settings. This is because the virus passes between people through infected respiratory particles in the form of droplets and aerosols. In poorly ventilated spaces infected aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther  than conversational distance. Improving indoor ventilation reduces the risk of the virus spreading indoors. For practical advice, please see our infographic. Download infographic Ventilation is not a standalone measure and it should be\r\nimplemented as part of a comprehensive package of measures, such as physical\r\ndistancing, avoiding crowds, wearing a mask, frequent hand cleaning, staying\r\nhome if unwell, coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow, and vaccination. Each\r\nof these is important to protect you against COVID-19 infection. Find out more about how to stay safe on\r\nour public advice page ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "How do I improve ventilation in my home or workplace?", "answer": "When you are inside, open windows or doors whenever possible. For better ventilation, open windows/doors on opposite sides of a room to create a cross breeze. If creating a cross breeze is not possible, you can place a fan in front of an open window to increase air flow and push indoor air outside. If the temperature outside is extremely hot or cold, you can open windows for a few minutes every hour to bring in fresh air."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "Will an air conditioner provide good ventilation?", "answer": "The majority of wall or window unit air conditioning systems do not provide ventilation. They are designed to reduce the temperature and humidity of the air, and they do this by recirculating indoor air. Whenever using a wall or window unit air conditioning system, open windows for a few minutes every hour to bring in fresh air from the outside. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems pull outside air inside. Make sure the settings on your HVAC system maximize the amount of fresh, outdoor air that is pulled into the system. HVAC systems should always be regularly inspected, maintained and cleaned according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. If you are riding in a vehicle that has air conditioning, make sure to use the setting that bring in fresh air."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "How can I improve heating and air conditioning systems at home?", "answer": "Non-ducted heating and air conditioning units that recirculate\r\nair, such as fan-coil or split units, should be assessed, maintained and\r\ncleaned according to manufacturer recommendations. Assess the unit’s filter and\r\nconsider replacing the existing filter with a MERV14/ISO ePM1 70-80% air filter\r\nor the highest compatible filter with the filter rack, in collaboration with an\r\nHVAC professional. The units and filters should be periodically cleaned and\r\nmaintained according to manufacturer recommendations. More information is\r\navailable here."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "Can fans be used safely inside?", "answer": "Using a fan in an enclosed space can increase the spread of the virus\r\nthat causes COVID-19. This is why it is important to open windows and doors\r\nwhenever using a fan to replace indoor air without outdoor air. If using a pedestal fan, minimize as much as possible how much air blows from one person (or group of people) to another person (or group of people). You can place a fan in front of an open window to increase air flow and push indoor air outside. The use of ceiling fans can improve the circulation of air from outside and avoid pockets of stagnant air forming indoors. However, it is important to bring in air from the outside by opening windows when using a ceiling fan."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "How can I improve ventilation at home if someone is sick with the virus that causes COVID-19?", "answer": "If someone is sick and being cared for at home, the following can be done to improve ventilation and reduce the risk of infection to other members of the household: Whenever possible,      the ill person should stay in a separate room. If this is not possible,      then keep at least a 1-metre distance from them. The sick person and      anyone else in the same room should wear a medical mask. Provide good      ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open      windows whenever possible. Create a      cross breeze by opening windows or doors on opposite sides of the ill      person’s room. If possible,      try to prevent the air from moving from the sick person’s room to the rest      of the house. If available, the ill person should stay in a separate room that has a      private toilet with an air extractor or exhaust fan, which should run at a      high speed. As a      supplement, you can use a stand-alone air cleaner with a MERV14/ISO ePM1      70-80% air filter. MERV14/F8 filter. These devices may improve air quality      but are not a replacement for ventilation. Also see WHO’s Q&A on homecare ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "Is it safe for me to have visitors in my home if I have good ventilation?", "answer": "In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no “zero risk” when it comes to gathering with others, but there are many ways in which you can reduce the risk of infection and spread of the COVID-19 virus. In general, you are at risk of COVID-19 infection whenever you get together with people and risk reduction measures are not in place.  If you meet with others who live outside of your household, WHO recommends to meet outdoors whenever possible. Outdoor venues are safer than indoor venues because there is more air flow and fresh air. If you have visitors in your home, always maintain a physical distance of at least 1 metre, wear a mask, and open windows to improve air flow. To enhance ventilation, create a cross breeze or place a fan in front of an open window facing the outside. For more details, see “How do I improve ventilation in my home or workplace?” above."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "Do portable air filters provide ventilation?", "answer": "Air filters do not provide ventilation and do not replace other ventilation methods. However, they can help to reduce the concentration of the COVID-19 virus in the air, thus reducing the possibility of transmission. A MERV14/ISO ePM1 70-80% air filter can improve air quality when used in indoor settings."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "Does mosquito screening impact ventilation?", "answer": "Simple mosquito screening on doors and windows is important for protecting yourself against the diseases spread by mosquitoes and other insects.  The use of such screens may reduce the natural ventilation rate and it is recommended where screens are used that more screened windows are opened to create cross ventilation."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "How can I improve ventilation in a car or vehicle?", "answer": "When riding in a car or vehicle open windows whenever possible, the more windows the better. If you are using air conditioning in the vehicle, use the setting that brings in fresh air."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "How can ventilation reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes?", "answer": "Most airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, reducing risk exposure to any potential infectious virus or bacteria expelled by a cough or sneeze. Cabin air systems are designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free. However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre, wearing a mask, cleaning hands frequently, and sneezing/coughing into a bent elbow or tissue, and getting vaccinated when you can."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ventilation-and-air-conditioning", "question": "What is WHO doing to address ventilation in the context of COVID-19?", "answer": "Since January 2020, WHO has provided recommendation on\r\nventilation in COVID-19 guidance. Early in the pandemic, WHO established the\r\nWHO Environment and Engineering Control Expert Advisory Panel (ECAP) for\r\nCOVID-19 to review available scientific evidence and practices and update\r\nrecommendations on environment and engineering controls. This multidisciplinary\r\nnetwork brings together technical experts from various fields, such as\r\ninfection control specialists, engineers, architects, aerobiologists and\r\nenvironmental experts. In June 2020, WHO contributed to guidance on ventilation and\r\nair-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available here. WHO works closely with the World Meteorological\r\nOrganization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National\r\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Health\r\nInformation Network to develop and update this guidance. Throughout 2020 and\r\n2021, WHO experts worked to enhance ventilation guidance in a number of\r\ntechnical guidance products for different settings including health facilities,\r\nhomes, quarantine facilities, schools and businesses. In addition, in March 2021,\r\nWHO published a roadmap to improve ventilation in various settings."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted", "question": "How does COVID-19 spread between people?", "answer": "We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways. Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range  aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission). The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission). People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is also under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why some are more transmissible. For updated information on SARS-CoV-2 variants, please read the weekly epidemiologic updates ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted", "question": "When do infected people transmit the virus?", "answer": "Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people. Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer. While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted", "question": "What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean someone without symptoms?", "answer": "Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted", "question": "Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?", "answer": "Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission. The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily: Crowded places; Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other; Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3Cs” overlap. In health facilities where people are receiving treatment for COVID-19, there is an increased risk of infection during medical procedures called aerosol generating procedures. These can produce very small droplets that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time and spread beyond conversational distances (typically 1 meter). This is why health workers performing these procedures or in settings where these procedures are performed should take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirators. This is also why visitors are not permitted in areas where these procedures are being performed."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted", "question": "How can I reduce my risk of getting COVID-19?", "answer": "There are many things you can do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from COVID-19. Know your risks to lower risks. Follow these basic precautions: Follow local guidance: Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant information for where you are. Keep your distance: Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick, since people can have the virus without having symptoms. Wear a mask:  Wear a well-fitting three-layer mask, especially when you can’t physically distance, or if you’re indoors. Clean your hands before putting on and taking off a mask. Read our Masks and COVID-19 Q&A and watch our videos on how to wear and make masks. Avoid crowded places, poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid prolonged contact with others. Spend more time outdoors than indoors. Ventilation is important: Open windows when indoors to increase the amount of outdoor air. Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry alcohol-based rub with you and use it often. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub. Get vaccinated: When it’s your turn, get vaccinated. Follow local guidance and recommendations about vaccination. Read our public advice page for more information.

{"topic": "/introduction-to-gcf-readiness-programme", "question": "What is the GCF Readiness Programme?", "answer": "The Readiness Programme is a funding mechanism of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that provides resources for strengthening institutional capacities, governance mechanisms, and planning and programming frameworks to identify a transformational long-term climate action agenda for developing countries. Readiness activities emphasize strengthening institutional capacities of National Designated Authorities (NDAs) or focal points and Direct Access Entities to efficiently engage with GCF. It also assists countries in undertaking adaptation planning and developing strategic frameworks to build their programming with GCF."}
{"topic": "/introduction-to-gcf-readiness-programme", "question": "Are there specific activities that will be funded under the GCF Readiness Program?", "answer": "The Readiness Programme is designed to be a flexible tool to support developing countries, so GCF has not defined a list of activities that can be supported under the programme. However, there are eligible and non-eligible costs (refer to Q&A on “Accessing and Implementing GCF Readiness Funds”). Within these parameters, countries are encouraged to develop readiness support requests based on defined needs in complementarity with previous or ongoing initiatives and in alignment with the national vision for climate action. Eligible activities proposed under the programme must contribute to one or more of the following objectives: Objective 1: Capacity building for climate finance coordination Objective 2: Strategic frameworks for low-emission investment Objective 3: Strengthened adaptation planning Objective 4: Paradigm-shifting pipeline development Objective 5: Knowledge sharing and learning"}
{"topic": "/introduction-to-gcf-readiness-programme", "question": "Are readiness projects intended to be regional or country-specific?", "answer": "Readiness proposals can be developed and submitted at country level or at regional level depending on the context-specific needs of the country/ies.  NDAs may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously and countries can participate in both regional and country level readiness projects (provided they have not exceeded the funding caps)."}

What are multi-year readiness proposals?", "answer": "Multi-year strategic readiness (or ‘multi-year cap’) proposals can be submitted for readiness activities that will be implemented over multiple years, up to a maximum of 36 months. The main purpose of a multi-year proposal is to allow countries to be more programmatic in their approach to readiness and to address specific identified needs and priorities. This type of proposal allows the NDA to use subsequent calendar years’ USD 1 million cap and apply it to a single proposal. Support requests must be greater than USD 1 million and up to a maximum of USD 3 million (capped at USD 1 million/country/year) as illustrated in the table below: Figure 1 GCF Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook p.48 Applications must include indicative work plans and budgets for each 12-month period. Countries and delivery partners should carefully read the conditions for submission in the guidebook for this type of readiness proposal."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "2. Is this separate to the USD 1 million cap?", "answer": "No. The annual readiness cap remains in place and the Secretariat can only commit up to USD 1 million per calendar year.  Therefore, for a multi-year proposal no more than USD 1 million per year can be funded and the proposal budget must be within the USD 1 million cap for the year of proposal approval."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "3. Can I request funding for adaptation planning (Objective 3) in multi-year readiness proposals?", "answer": "No, national adaptation planning (Objective 3) cannot be included in this type of proposal."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "4. Who can apply for a multi-year proposal?", "answer": "All developing countries may submit these proposals, provided that the NDA: Has a finalized Country Programme that contains an analysis of the country’s readiness needs; OR Has undertaken a readiness needs assessment and developed a work plan to address those needs. If the NDA does not meet these requirements, the needs assessment may be included as an activity in a regular readiness proposal so that in the future a multi-year proposal can be submitted."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "5. Is it possible to have more than one delivery partner in a multi-year proposal?", "answer": "No, as with regular readiness proposals, multi-year proposals must be led by one delivery partner that is responsible for the project."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "6. Is the proposal documentation the same for a multi-year readiness proposal?", "answer": "Existing templates should be used to develop and submit a multi-year readiness proposal.  However, there are some additional requirements for a multi-year proposal. A needs assessment is recommended for a regular readiness proposal but is required for a multi-year proposal (this may have already been conducted as part of a finalized Country Programme).  This assessment should be conducted/overseen by the NDA and include, but not be limited to, health.  If a separate health sector needs assessment is conducted, it should be linked to, and expand on, the health needs identified overall needs assessment. The documents must cover the entire envisioned grant term.  Indicative work plans and budgets for each 12-month period of the proposal must be included in the overall proposal."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "7. Is there a specific template for the Needs Assessment?", "answer": "There is no template, however the Readiness Guidebook (p.8) provides guidance on key areas for inclusion in the assessment: The multi-stakeholder readiness needs assessment should: Be conducted or overseen by the NDA in consultation with other stakeholders; Be bolstered by technical guidance from the Secretariat regarding its application; Appraise a variety of essential capacities, institutional mechanisms and technical skills; Establish a baseline to help the NDA and the Secretariat better understand how to approach readiness support in a strategic manner; Consider identified capacity needs through existing processes and documents, including National Communications, National Capacity Self Assessments, and those undertaken by other funds, bilateral or multilateral agencies, and multilateral development banks; Consider capacity building initiatives and assessments for climate change done under other auspices and include feedback on previous Readiness support; and Give due attention to the issues of Environmental and Social Safeguards, gender and Indigenous Peoples integration. Core elements of a needs assessment: Institutions and governance; Policy environment; Pipeline status and development; Information, data and knowledge. Furthermore, the assessment should be conducted at strategic level by the NDA for all priority issues in the country (not solely on health). If your country has needs assessments that have already been developed you are encouraged to submit those to your GCF regional officers for review and provide an opinion as to whether they are adequate for this proposal process. More information on the needs assessment, and other requirements for the multi-year proposals, can be found in the Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme Guidebook ."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "8. Are there any specific requirements for implementation of multi-year proposals?", "answer": "For multi-year proposals the NDA must submit 12-month work plans and budgets for GCF approval on an annual basis.  The work plans include: updated logframe; budget and procurement plan; risk management strategy; and lessons learned from implementation to date and how the NDA and delivery partner have incorporated those lessons to improve the next stage of implementation.  Milestones from the previous 12-month work plan must be achieved to unlock approval for subsequent annual workplans."}
{"topic": "/preparing-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "9. Can I still submit more than one readiness proposal?", "answer": "Yes.  Countries may submit and implement both multi-year and regular readiness proposals provided that the USD 1 million per year cap is not exceeded."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "1. Can multiple countries submit a regional readiness proposal?", "answer": "Several countries can develop a regional-level readiness proposal. Each country included in the proposal must contribute a part of their USD 1 million cap and all countries will benefit from the activities. Not every country must contribute the same amount to the proposal. For example, if five countries develop a regional readiness proposal and each agrees to contribute USD 300k, the total readiness proposal value will be USD 1.5 million. Another example is if two countries contribute USD 400k and three countries contribute 100k, then the total readiness proposal value will be USD 1.1 million. The multi-country proposal is submitted by the NDA of a lead country. The NDAs of the remaining countries must submit Letters of Financial Support."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "2. What is a letter of financial support?", "answer": "For regional or multi-country proposals, participating NDAs must submit Letters of Financial Support indicating the amount of their annual cap they will contribute to the overall proposal budget (this counts towards their annual USD 1 million cap) and expressing their support for the proposal. The budget breakdown per country is entirely the decision of the participating NDAs; it does not have to be equal amounts."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "3. Can regional (i.e. multi-country) proposals seek support for Objective 3 on adaptation planning?", "answer": "No, these proposals may not seek support for Objective 3 on adaptation planning."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "4. Is it possible for a country to join a regional proposal and at the same time submit country-level readiness funding proposals?", "answer": "Yes. Countries can submit proposals for up to USD 1 million per year. National Designated Authorities (NDAs) may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously. If a country joins a regional proposal and agrees to contribute USD 300k, for example, and they have no other readiness projects for that year, then the remaining USD 700k can be sought for other country-level readiness activities."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "5. Who submits a regional readiness proposal?", "answer": "A regional readiness proposal is submitted by a \"Lead\" Nationally Designated Authority (NDA), along with Financial Support Letters from the NDAs of all other participating countries."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "6. How are regional readiness projects coordinated?", "answer": "The regional-level coordination will depend upon the specific projects and country contexts. NDAs have national level coordination mechanisms which will need to be considered in planning regional level coordination. However, regional coordination for a readiness project where WHO is the delivery partner will be provided by the WHO Regional Office."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "7. For regional projects, how are funds disbursed to multiple countries?", "answer": "Funding is dispersed to the readiness Delivery Partner and not directly to participating countries. For regional readiness projects where WHO is the delivery partner WHO HQ will receive funds directly from the GCF. These funds will then be transferred to the respective WHO Regional Office for management and implementation of the Regional proposal. arrangement of the proposal."}
{"topic": "/regional-proposals-gcf-readiness", "question": "8. Can a country submit its own readiness proposal related to health on an individual basis and not on regional basis?", "answer": "Yes."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-casirivimab-and-imdevimab---monoclonal-antibody-therapy", "question": "I have COVID-19, should I be prescribed this monoclonal antibody therapy?", "answer": "A combination of casirivimab and imdevimab, a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron, is recommended for: Patients with confirmed non-severe COVID-19 at highest risk for hospitalization. Those at highest risk are typically individuals older than 60, have a chronic disease, are immunocompromised, or are not vaccinated. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19* who do not have antibodies to the COVID-19 virus    (i.e., those who are seronegative). This drug should be administered by a healthcare worker in a monitored clinical setting along with the current standard of care for COVID-19 which may include oxygen and other medications. *A patient has severe COVID-19 when they have signs of pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, and their blood oxygen level is low. A patient has critical COVID-19 when they need life sustaining treatment, have acute respiratory distress syndrome, or have septic shock (evidence of injury to other organs ). More."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-casirivimab-and-imdevimab---monoclonal-antibody-therapy", "question": "How is this monoclonal antibody therapy administered and what is the dosage?", "answer": "Casirivimab and imdevimab should be administered by a healthcare worker in a monitored clinical setting intravenously through an infusion (drip). In some instances, the medication may be given subcutaneously through an injection. The dosage of the medication will be determined by the healthcare provider. For patients with non-severe COVID-19 the total dose of casirivimab and imdevimab is 1200 – 2400 mg given once intravenously. Alternatively, a patient may receive a total one-time dose of 1200 mg subcutaneously.

If you are pregnant or breastfeeding discuss the risks and benefits of this drug with your healthcare provider first."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-casirivimab-and-imdevimab---monoclonal-antibody-therapy", "question": "How does this monoclonal antibody therapy act?", "answer": "These drugs (casirivimab and imdevimab) are antibodies like the ones produced by our bodies when they are faced with the COVID-19 virus. They act by blocking the ability of the virus to infect our body’s cells. Casirivimab and imdevimab are a combination of two recombinant human antibodies that targets a different part of the spike protein, the part of the coronavirus responsible for infecting human cells."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-casirivimab-and-imdevimab---monoclonal-antibody-therapy", "question": "Are there any side effects? Interactions with other drugs?", "answer": "In rare instances, patients receiving casirivimab and imdevimab can develop severe allergic reactions. If this occurs, appropriate medical therapy should be initiated immediately. This is why it is important for patients to receive this medication in the presence of a healthcare professional in a monitored clinical setting. Infusion-related reactions are rare and may occur while receiving the infusion or up to 24 hours after completion. If during the infusion a severe or life-threatening reaction occurs, the infusion may be given more slowly or stopped. Signs of an infusion-related reaction include fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygenation, chills, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, chest pain or discomfort, weakness, nausea, headache, angioedema (swelling of the lips), throat irritation, hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension (low blood pressure), throat irritation, rash, tching, muscle aches, feeling faint, passing out, dizziness, and diaphoresis (sweating)."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-casirivimab-and-imdevimab---monoclonal-antibody-therapy", "question": "How expensive is this drug? Is it widely available?", "answer": "There is currently a shortage of casirivimab and imdevimab globally and these medications are expensive. WHO and partners are working with the manufacturer of this therapeutic, Roche Pharmaceutical, to see how the medication can be developed and obtained at a lower price. It is important that we improve access to this life saving medication in low- and middle-income countries  . WHO has launched a call to manufacturers to submit biosimilar versions of this drug for approval or prequalification . This would allow global production to be ramped up so that more people can access the drugs."}

This would allow global production to be ramped up so that more people can access the drugs."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What is the EML antibiotic book?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book is a resource to help countries and health care systems implement responsible use of antibiotics recommended by WHO for specific infections and contained in the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines. The book provides recommendations on the choice of antibiotics for common infectious diseases These recommendations are complemented by other suggestions on management strategies for infectious diseases, most of which have been derived by ‘expert consensus’ as scientific evidence was limited or absent. However, in some instances, which are specifically highlighted in the book, the guidance in the EML antibiotic book is based on and in full alignment with recommendations in WHO guidelines (e.g. for sexually transmitted infections). The book will be finalized following feedback from a global public consultation. It is important that as many stakeholders as possible contribute their ‘real world’ input to the public consultation so that the guidance can be as close as possible to realities in different clinical settings."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What kind of information does the EML antibiotic book provide?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book provides information on which antibiotics to use for certain infections but, importantly, also emphasizes when disease management without antibiotics is the best approach. For example, the majority of upper respiratory tract infections, which are mostly viral and/or self-limiting, should not generally be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics may be necessary in some cases - e.g. signs and symptoms of severe infections, severe immunosuppression, etc. – and the book also outlines these."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How is the empiric use of Reserve antibiotics covered in the EML antibiotic book?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book has a section dedicated to Reserve antibiotics currently listed in the Model Lists of Essential Medicines. The book describes situations where empiric use of these last-resort antibiotics could be considered in clinical practice – e.g. seriously ill patients known to be colonized by multidrug-resistant organisms and who have not responded to other antibiotics and in whom other causes of treatment failure have been excluded."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How is the EML antibiotic book integrated with other WHO activities?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book integrates closely with other WHO activities and tools to address antimicrobial resistance, such as the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) , the Priority Pathogens List , the review of clinical and preclinical antibacterial pipelines and the antimicrobial stewardship toolkit ; as well as the WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics . All these activities have been taken into account in the development of the EML antibiotic book, and will integrate and influence each other into the future."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "In what settings is the EML antibiotic book intended to be used?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book is intended for use by clinicians in both the primary care and hospital settings worldwide. It includes 20 chapters in the primary health care section and 17 in the hospital facility section. It is acknowledged that the majority of antibiotic use happens in the community, but hospitals are an ideal place for transmission of resistance, so it is important to improve antibiotic use in both settings. However, for the hospital setting, the book focuses on community-acquired infections. Nosocomial infections are mentioned in the sections covering the use of Reserve antibiotics and may be addressed in more detail in future editions. The recommendations are equally relevant for physicians and health professionals from low-, middle-, and high-income settings. This handbook can make a greater impact in those care settings where currently no or limited guidance on the management of common infections exist."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What is AWaRe?", "answer": "AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) is a classification system of antibiotics developed by WHO in 2017 and updated in 2019 and 2021 aimed at optimizing antibiotic use taking into account what is best for patients in terms of clinical effectiveness and minimal toxicity, while minimizing the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance. According to this system, antibiotics can fall into one of three groups: Access : antibiotics with a narrow spectrum of activity and a lower potential for the development of antimicrobial resistance compared to antibiotics in other AWaRe groups. They are recommended for the empiric treatment of most infections and therefore should be widely available. Watch : antibiotics with a higher potential for the development of antimicrobial resistance with very limited recommended indications for empiric use. Their use should be carefully monitored to avoid overuse. Reserve : antibiotics that should only be used when antibiotics from the other two classes cannot be used (e.g. due to infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens). All antibiotics listed in the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines are classified according to the AWaRe groups but there are many more antibiotics classified as Access, Watch or Reserve that are not included on the Model Lists. The 2021 AWaRe classification of antibiotics is available here ."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What is the additional value of the EML antibiotic book?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book can supplement local guidance and help countries reach the target of 60% of antibiotic use coming from the Access group, established in the WHO 13th General Programme of Work (GPW 13) in 2018. The book puts a strong emphasis on symptomatic care for mild infections in otherwise healthy patients and on the use of Access antibiotics compared to other guidelines. It provides evidence-based guidance for the use of first and second-choice antibiotics for many common infections based on the AWaRe framework."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What does the EML antibiotic book add to AWaRe?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book is a simple clinical guidance on how to best use antibiotics on the Model Lists of Essential Medicines in children and adults both in primary health care and hospital settings based on the principles of the AWaRe framework in particular by favouring the use of Access antibiotics where appropriate. Where applicable, the book explicitly mentions the need to consider risk factors for infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens especially in very sick patients where an inadequate empiric treatment is most likely to negatively affect cure and survival. Additionally, GLASS surveillance data are referenced where applicable and situations when local surveillance could be useful to inform empiric treatment are highlighted."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What is the role of Access antibiotics in the management of infections in primary care?", "answer": "Many infections in primary care can be safely managed without antibiotics, namely most upper respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, when antibiotics are indicated, Access antibiotics remain “first choice”. Nine out of the ten most common infections in primary care are recommended to be managed with either no antibiotics or Access group antibiotics (the only exception being bacterial dysentery-bloody diarrhoea, where Watch antibiotics are recommended)."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How were the infections covered in the EML antibiotic book selected?", "answer": "The infections covered in the EML antibiotic book are those addressed in the current Model Lists of Essential Medicines. Antibiotic treatment of these infections has been comprehensively reviewed by the WHO EML antibiotics working group (a group of experts in infectious diseases and microbiology from around the world) and the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines. The book also includes guidance on the use of the Reserve antibiotics included on the current Model Lists."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What was the choice of antibiotic treatment options for the different infections based on?", "answer": "The antibiotic book gives guidance on first- and second-choice antibiotics for the empiric treatment of common infections in line with the recommendation in the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines. These recommendations are based on a deliberative, structured, evidence-based and transparent development process that included assessments of clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines. The quality of the evidence for each systematic review and meta-analysis was evaluated based on five factors: Conclusions of the original authors (e.g. including overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE assessment) Sample size of the studies Number of events Number of studies per outcome Publication year A rating of high, moderate, low, or very low quality was assigned for each of these five factors. Clinical practice guidelines were rated using 11 attributes: The overall objective(s) of the guideline is (are) specifically described The health question(s) covered by the guideline is (are) specifically described The population (patients, public, etc.) to whom the guideline is meant to apply is specifically described The guideline development group includes individuals from all the relevant professional groups Systematic methods were used to search for evidence The criteria for selecting the evidence are clearly described The strengths and limitations of the body of evidence are clearly described The methods for formulating the recommendations are clearly described The health benefits, side effects, and risks have been considered in formulating the recommendations There is an explicit link between the recommendations and the supporting evidence The guideline has been externally reviewed by experts prior to its publication Guidelines with scores of 70% or less were judged to be of low quality, while guidelines with scores of 80% or more were judged to be of high quality."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How were differences in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance among countries taken into account?", "answer": "The need to consider the local epidemiological context and individual risk factors is clearly highlighted in the book where relevant. However, the book does not give country-specific examples and users should take the local context into account in terms of when the use of an alternative empiric treatment may be preferable."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What was the choice of antibiotic dose and treatment duration based on?", "answer": "Treatment dose and duration are based on non-systematic reviews of the literature and expert opinion within the EML antibiotic working group. Formal assessments of the quality of the evidence were not performed. The dose and duration of treatment should take into account the specific characteristics of the patient, the clinical setting, the situation and the available resources. Wherever possible, short treatment durations are suggested, and the need to adapt treatment based on microbiology result and to switch patients from intravenous to oral treatment is emphasized."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How were differences in the availability of supportive tools (e.g. imaging, diagnostics) taken into account in the development of the EML antibiotic book?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book acknowledges that tests and imaging will differ based on local availabilities. For laboratory tests, the WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics was taken as a reference and only tests included in it are mentioned. For imaging, in general the most widely available and less expensive tests are suggested (e.g. ultrasound, X-ray)."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How does the EML antibiotic book help prescribers decide whether their patient needs antibiotics?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book presents the most common clinical presentations of a given syndrome, suggests diagnostic tests (based on the WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics) and imaging to better understand whether a bacterial infection is present and whether it is mild or severe. When available, the book also mentions scoring systems. However, it is clear that personal clinical judgement taking into account the circumstances of the individual patient remains key in terms of deciding how the case should be managed."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What should be the role of the EML antibiotic book in relation to existing local or national guidelines?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book is a complementary tool to fill potential gaps in existing guidelines. Furthermore, the antibiotic book with its focus on favouring the use of Access antibiotics could be used as a template for updating or adapting local guidelines to help reach the WHO target of 60% Access antibiotic use. Local specificities of the healthcare system, and prevalence of resistance among common pathogens causing infections should always be considered when using the book."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What if there are differences between the EML antibiotic book and existing WHO guidelines?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book is closely aligned with existing WHO guidelines (e.g. for sexually transmitted diseases, pneumonia in children and sepsis). If differences exist, these are clearly highlighted and justified in the text (e.g. changing prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens requiring different empiric treatment, new evidence from clinical trials of more effective and/or less toxic medicines). As new WHO guidelines may become available on topics covered in the book, these will ideally be incorporated in future updates of the book."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What if a medicine recommended as first choice treatment option is not available in a given country?", "answer": "Even though all antibiotics recommended in the book are on the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines and should therefore be usually available, it is acknowledged that availability may be a problem in some settings or circumstances. In many instances potential first-choice alternatives are highlighted in the book."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "How do the treatment recommendations in the EML antibiotic book take into account settings where the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms is very high?", "answer": "The EML antibiotic book covers empiric antibiotic treatment given when the diagnosis is based on the patient’s history and examination and test results are not yet available and its use in settings with a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms could require local adaptation based on local epidemiological data. Any decision to use antibiotics with broader spectrum (e.g. Watch antibiotics instead of Access antibiotics) should be based on solid data and should be balanced against the risk of further selecting for antibiotic resistance. To assist in this, the book explicitly mentions (where applicable) the need to consider risk factors for infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens especially in very sick patients where an inadequate empiric treatment is most likely to negatively affect cure and survival. Additionally, GLASS surveillance data are referenced where applicable and suggestions on when local surveillance could be useful to inform empiric treatment is given."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "Can the EML antibiotic book be adapted to the local setting?", "answer": "We encourage national and regional stakeholders to adapt the book or sections of it for their local use, taking into account the local microbiology epidemiology. However, despite the reality of differences in the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, there is a strong emphasis in the book in avoiding overtreatment of patients with antibiotics with an unnecessarily broad spectrum of activity especially for mild presentations in otherwise healthy patients with no known risk factors for infections caused by MDR pathogens and this is valid everywhere."}
{"topic": "/the-who-essential-medicines-list-antibiotic-book", "question": "What activities is WHO planning to help implement the use of the EML antibiotic book?", "answer": "WHO is currently planning the implementation phase and aims to assist countries in making use of the EML antibiotic book. WHO is committed to generating more evidence on how to improve antibiotic prescribing worldwide and will assist investigators in different settings in designing and analyzing studies about the impact of WHO recommendations on changing clinical decisions, reducing antimicrobial resistance, increasing knowledge about appropriate antibiotic appropriate use and enhancing quality of care."}

{"topic": "/hiv-aids-infant-feeding-and-nutrition", "question": "1. Can mothers living with HIV breastfeed their children in the same way as mothers without HIV?", "answer": "WHO recommends that all mothers living with HIV should receive life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) to support their health and to ensure the wellbeing of their infants. WHO released guidelines in July 2016 advising that, in countries that have opted to promote and support breastfeeding together with ART, mothers living with HIV who are on ART and adherent to therapy should breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months, and then add complementary feeding until 12 months of age. Breastfeeding with complementary feeding may continue until 24 months of age or beyond. Previously, WHO advice was to breastfeed for 12 months but then stop breastfeeding if a nutritionally adequate and safe diet could be provided. The new guidance is based on scientific evidence that shows ART is very effective at preventing HIV transmission through breastfeeding as long as the mother is adherent to therapy. The new evidence means that mothers living with HIV and their children can benefit from the many advantages of breastfeeding – such as improved growth and development – in the same way as mothers who do not have HIV and their children. WHO recommendations emphasise the need for health systems to therefore achieve quality HIV services that reliably provide ART and continue to care for mothers living with HIV."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids-infant-feeding-and-nutrition", "question": "2. Is mixed feeding better than no breastfeeding at all, if the mother is on HIV treatment?", "answer": "Yes. Mothers living with HIV can be reassured that ART reduces the risk of post-natal HIV transmission even when the baby is on mixed feeding. Although exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months, mixed feeding is better than no breastfeeding. Encouraging mothers living with HIV to breastfeed exclusively is still strongly advised because it benefits the infant in many ways including, reduced illness, and improved growth and development."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids-infant-feeding-and-nutrition", "question": "3. If a mother on HIV treatment plans to return to work or school, is a shorter duration of breastfeeding better than no breastfeeding at all?", "answer": "Yes. Mothers and health-care workers can be reassured that shorter durations of breastfeeding of less than 12 months are better than never initiating breastfeeding."}
{"topic": "/hiv-aids-infant-feeding-and-nutrition", "question": "4. What can be done to support breastfeeding among mothers living with HIV?", "answer": "Governments and local authorities should actively promote and implement services to create a supportive environment for mothers living with HIV to remain adherent to treatment and to breastfeed their infants in all settings: at work, at community centres, in health clinics, and in their homes."}
{"topic": "/q-a-inclusion-of-bupropion-and-varenicline-in-the-who-model-list-of-essential-medicines", "question": "What are bupropion and varenicline?", "answer": "Bupropion and varenicline are non-nicotine pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation. Bupropion may reduce cravings and symptoms of nicotine withdrawal through its competitive inhibitory effect on nicotinic receptors. Varenicline can reduce cravings and nicotine withdrawal symptoms through its ability to serve as a partial nicotine receptor agonist and a nicotine receptor antagonist."}
{"topic": "/q-a-inclusion-of-bupropion-and-varenicline-in-the-who-model-list-of-essential-medicines", "question": "How many tobacco cessation medications are on WHO Model List of Essential Medicines?", "answer": "In the latest edition of WHO EML, varenicline and bupropion are now listed under section 24.5 “Medicines for disorders due to psychoactive substance use”, together with nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum and patch).

Both medications are providing alternative treatment options, as an addition to nicotine replacement therapy, for people who want to stop smoking. Tobacco users are also recommended to use other quitting tools such as toll-free quit lines, chatbots and quit apps like WhatsApp, Viber and Florence."}
{"topic": "/q-a-inclusion-of-bupropion-and-varenicline-in-the-who-model-list-of-essential-medicines", "question": "What are the implications and policy recommendations of this announcement?", "answer": "The inclusion of two new non-nicotine smoking cessation medications on WHO EML calls for national governments to broaden the scope of tobacco cessation services provided. Countries should consider using WHO EML to update their national essential medicines lists and taking complementary measures such as voluntary licensing mechanisms, pooled procurement, and price negotiation to promote equitable and affordable access to three evidence-based smoking cessation medications. Countries should incorporate these medicines in more comprehensive approach to promote smoking cessation such as advice from physicians, national toll-free quit line and behavioral interventions delivered via mobile text messaging (mCessation). Countries should consider providing cost-coverage for the use of NRT, bupropion and varenicline by tobacco users. Countries should consider recommending NRT, bupropion and varenicline in their national clinical treatment guidelines for tobacco cessation following the upcoming WHO Clinical Treatment Guideline for Tobacco Cessation."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-and-national-tobacco-cessation-investment-cases", "question": "What is the global tobacco cessation investment case?", "answer": "There are 1.3 billion tobacco users in the world and most of them live in low- and middle-income countries. The global investment case provides sound economic arguments for why increased investment in comprehensive tobacco cessation services globally saves lives and money. These services include proven interventions like brief advice, quit lines, digital quit tools (mCessation), nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-and-national-tobacco-cessation-investment-cases", "question": "What are the main arguments for prioritising investments in tobacco cessation services?", "answer": "The global investment case is based on an analysis of the return on investment in 124 low- and middle-income countries. It shows that by the time the quitters reach 65 years, 16 million lives would be saved and each dollar invested would have yielded $7.50 in gains. Tobacco is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases, like cancer, lung disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which represent the highest burden of disease globally. Investing in tobacco cessation support saves lives, and fosters healthier populations and economies worldwide."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-and-national-tobacco-cessation-investment-cases", "question": "Why should countries develop national tobacco cessation investment cases?", "answer": "By building on the framework of the global investment case, the national investment cases represent a deep dive into economic and political contexts in countries and provides an economic rationale for national decision makers to invest in proven tobacco cessation interventions."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-and-national-tobacco-cessation-investment-cases", "question": "What are the implications and policy recommendations of the tobacco cessation investment case?", "answer": "It’s time to invest in tobacco cessation in LMICs. The case for investment in tobacco cessation has never been clearer- Investing 21 cents per capita annually for three population-level interventions can lead to 1.4 million lives saved by 2030; $1.68 per capita per year for comprehensive tobacco cessation interventions in 10 years saves 16 million lives. The national tobacco cessation investment case methodology incorporates both economic and political perspectives to ensure that the recommendations on domestic investment in tobacco cessation are made in the context of institutional capacities and economic and political environments."}

{"topic": "/who-cessation-consortium", "question": "What are the implications and policy recommendations of The Consortium?", "answer": "The Consortium can be used as WHO’s vehicle for market shaping of NRTs, bupropion and varenicline, the three essential medicines for tobacco cessation to make them accessible and affordable in countries. The Consortium could also be used as a tool to pool funds for WHO’s tobacco cessation activities worldwide. The Consortium will serve as the incubator and hub for innovative solutions including digital technology solutions, such as AI tool, working closely with the Be Healthy Be Mobile Initiative of WHO-ITU. The Consortium could provide guidance on R&D focused on tobacco dependence treatment. The Consortium is expected to serve as a knowledge hub for countries to obtain the necessary resources and guidance needed for scaling up cessation services, tools, including updating their national essential medicines lists in line with Model WHO\r\n        EML list. To this effect they could look at complementary measures such as voluntary licensing mechanisms, pooled procurement, and price negotiation to promote equitable and affordable access to various behavioral counselling tools and pharmacotherapies."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "What is myocarditis, pericarditis and myopericarditis?", "answer": "Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) and pericarditis is an inflammation of the membrane around the heart (pericardium). When both heart muscle and the membrane are inflamed, the condition is known as myopericarditis. The most\r\n    common cause of myocarditis is viral infection, but it can also be caused by a bacterial infection, a reaction to a drug or an autoimmune disease."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "How do I know if I have myocarditis or pericarditis? What are the symptoms?", "answer": "For both myocarditis and pericarditis, symptoms include new and persistent chest pain, shortness of breath and heart palpitations (racing or pounding heartbeat). If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "Can myocarditis and pericarditis be treated?", "answer": "The symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis are usually mild to moderate and respond well to treatment.

{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "Is there a link between some COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis and pericarditis?", "answer": "There have been reports of very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines ( Pfizer and Moderna ), most often after the second dose. While myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many factors, the currently available data suggest there is a potential relationship between these symptoms and the vaccines. More data are needed to understand this potential relationship better. Myocarditis and pericarditis are more likely to be caused by COVID-19 infection than COVID-19 vaccination. See reference Barda study"}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "How common is myocarditis and/or pericarditis after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines?", "answer": "Billions of people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19. Reports of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are very rare.  In August 2021, the number of cases of myocarditis reported after\r\n        vaccination for both COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the US was about 40 cases per million people vaccinated after the second dose, mostly in males aged 12-29 years. The number was lower in males older than 30 years and in females of any age. Preliminary\r\n        data suggest that the occurrence of myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA vaccines may be slightly higher with Moderna (Spikevax) than with Pfizer (Comirnaty) vaccine. Research is underway to understand and confirm these data."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "Is it safe for males under 30 and people of all ages to be vaccinated with mRNA vaccines?", "answer": "International regulatory agencies have assessed that the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalization and death greatly outweighs the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination in vaccine-eligible age groups. COVID-19 vaccines protect health and save lives. See ACIP benefit-risk example Even if preliminary data show that there is a slightly higher incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in young males up to 30 years old, cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination in this age group remain very rare."}

You can let your doctor know that you have recently been vaccinated against COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "Is it safe to exercise after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines?", "answer": "At present, there are limited data available on the impact of exercise following vaccination. There is no current evidence that exercising after vaccination is linked to myocarditis or pericarditis. WHO does not currently recommend against exercise following\r\n    vaccination with an mRNA vaccine in absence of any symptoms. Some people will experience mild side effects after vaccination including tiredness and body aches, which may make them less inclined to exercise, in which case they should rest and stay     well hydrated until these symptoms go away within few days."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "Has myocarditis or pericarditis been reported after third doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "WHO is still gathering data on whether any cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following third doses of COVID-19 vaccines and will update their recommendations as soon as there is sufficient evidence to inform policy. At present, WHO recommends that moderately and severely immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine as part of an extended primary series since these individuals are less likely to respond adequately to vaccination\r\n    following a standard primary vaccine series and are at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease.

{"topic": "/q-a-on-myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines", "question": "Would the chances of myocarditis/pericarditis decrease if I wait longer for the second dose?", "answer": "You should go ahead and get your second dose when it is recommended by your national authorities.  Waiting to get your second dose leaves you vulnerable to COVID-19. Countries schedule first and second dose vaccinations so as to obtain the best\r\n        possible protection for their populations while minimizing risks to recipients within the capacity of their immunization programmes. More information is being gathered to determine if the timing of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination affects the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis."}

These statements can\r\n        be found on the WHO website ( GACVS 09 July 2021 , GACVS 26 May 2021 ). WHO will update policies and recommendations if and when any changes are supported by new data. Additionally, WHO is preparing teaching aids and other guidance for healthcare professionals and the public to make them aware of the signs and symptoms for myocarditis and pericarditis. WHO will continue to monitor these and other events and recommends\r\n        that countries collect and share all reports of adverse events following immunization observed with the new COVID-19 vaccines."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "What are the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines?", "answer": "The updated WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) provide recommendations on air quality guideline levels as well as interim targets for six key air pollutants. They also offer qualitative statements on good practices for the management of certain types of particulate matter (PM), for example, black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms, for which there is insufficient quantitative evidence to derive AQG levels. Based on the extensive scientific evidence currently available, the guidelines identify the levels of air quality necessary to protect public health worldwide. The AQGs also serve as a reference for assessing if, and by how much, the exposure of a population exceeds levels at which it might cause health concerns. They cover some of the most monitored pollutants critical for health, for which evidence on health effects from exposure has advanced the most in the past 15 years. The guidelines focus on so-called classical pollutants, particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO). When action is taken to reduce these classical pollutants it also has an impact on other pollutants. Guideline levels for specified pollutants can be used as an evidence-informed reference to help decision-makers in setting legally binding standards and goals for air quality management at international, national and local levels. They are also a practical instrument with which to design effective measures to achieve pollutant emission and concentration reductions, and therefore, to protect human health. WHO periodically issues these health-based AQGs to assist governments and civil society in reducing human exposure to air pollution and its adverse effects."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "What is new in these guidelines?", "answer": "Since the last 2005 global update, there has been a marked increase in the quality and quantity of evidence that shows how air pollution affects different aspects of health. For that reason, and after a systematic review of the accumulated evidence, several\r\n    of the updated AQG values are now lower than 15 years ago. There are also now clearer insights about sources of emissions and the contribution of air pollutants to the global burden of disease. Recommended 2021 AQG levels compared to 2005 air quality guidelines. µg = microgram ᵃ 99th percentile (i.e. 3–4 exceedance days per year). ᵇ Average of daily maximum 8-hour mean O₃ concentration in the six consecutive months with the highest six-month running-average O₃ concentration. Note: Annual and peak season is long-term exposure, while 24 hour and 8 hour is short-term exposure. Compared to previous WHO guidelines, the new AQGs: use new methods for evidence synthesis and guideline development; reinforce evidence on health effects; provide higher certainty in the evidence of health effects occurring at lower levels than previously understood; offer additional AQG levels, such as for peak season O₃ and 24-hour NO₂ and CO, as well as some new interim targets; offer new good practice statements on the management of certain types of PM (i.e. black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms)."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "What is air pollution and where are these pollutants found in daily life?", "answer": "Air pollution is the contamination of the air we breathe, indoors or outdoors, by any chemical, physical or biological agent that is potentially threatening to human and ecosystem health. The pollutants with the most robust evidence for public health\r\n    concern include particulate matter (PM), ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO). The health risks associated with PM smaller than or equal to 2.5 microns (µm) in diameter (PM₂.₅) are of particular\r\n    public health relevance. PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and PM₂.₅ can even enter the bloodstream, primarily resulting in cardiovascular and respiratory impacts. In 2013, outdoor air pollution and PM were classified as\r\n    carcinogenic by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Air pollution originates from numerous sources of emission, both natural and anthropogenic (resulting from human activity). The main sources of anthropogenic air pollution can vary geographically, but include the energy sector, the transport sector, domestic cooking and heating, waste dump sites, and industrial activities and agriculture. The process of combustion is the greatest contributor to air pollution, in particular the inefficient combustion of fossil fuels and biomass to generate energy. In indoor environments, the use of solid fuels and kerosene in unvented heating and cooking stoves, tobacco combustion and combustion for other purposes, such as cultural or religious practices, are important as well."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "How were the recommended AQG levels determined?", "answer": "The development of WHO guidelines adheres to a rigorous process of reviewing and evaluating evidence, and involves several groups of experts with well-defined roles. A guideline development group defines the scope and key questions of the guidelines,\r\n    and develops the recommendations, based on the distilled evidence provided by the systematic review team. In addition, an external review group provides valuable comments, while the WHO steering group, composed of WHO staff from all regions, oversees\r\n    implementation of the project. For the AQGs, more than 500 papers were identified for systematic review and synthetized to get the most up-to-date evidence for establishing the new AQG levels. These guidelines do not include recommendations about any kind of multiple exposures. In everyday life, people are often exposed to a mixture of air pollutants at the same time. WHO acknowledges the need to develop comprehensive models to quantify the effects of multiple exposures on human health. However, as the main body of evidence on air quality and health still focuses on the impact of single air pollutants on health outcomes, the current guidelines provide recommendations for each air pollutant individually."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "Why are the AQGs so important for protecting health?", "answer": "The burden of disease associated with both ambient and household air pollution exposure is large and growing. This is partly due to increases in exposures in low- and middle-income countries, but in part also due to the rapidly increasing prevalence of\r\n    noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide as a result of population ageing and lifestyle changes. Air pollution especially increases morbidity and mortality from the noncommunicable cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that are the major causes\r\n    of global mortality; it also increases the disease burden from lower respiratory tract infections and increases preterm birth and other causes of death in children and infants, which remain a major cause of the disease burden in low- and middle-income\r\n    countries. WHO estimates show that around 7 million premature deaths, mainly from noncommunicable diseases, are attributable to the joint effects of ambient and household air pollution. Global assessments of ambient air pollution alone suggest hundreds of millions of healthy years of life lost, with the greatest attributable disease burden seen in low and middle-income countries. Although air quality has improved gradually in high-income countries, pollutant concentrations still exceed the 2005 WHO AQGs for several pollutants in many areas. More than 90% of the global population in 2019 lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 WHO air quality guideline for long-term exposure to PM₂.₅. Air quality has generally deteriorated in most low- and middle-income countries, because of large-scale urbanization and economic development that has largely relied on the inefficient combustion of fossil fuels, like coal, as well as inefficient residential fuel use and industry. However, disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide, particularly as low- and middle-income countries are experiencing growing levels of air pollution."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "How is the burden of poor air quality distributed globally?", "answer": "Exposure to air pollutants is heavily dependent on their ambient concentrations. For example, ambient PM₂.₅ concentrations vary substantially between and within regions of the world. Importantly, more than 90% of the global population in 2019 lived in\r\n    areas where concentrations exceed the 2005 WHO AQG level of 10 µg/m³ – and with the 2021 AQG level being lower there will subsequently be an increase in the attributable health burden in all countries. In 2019, annual population-weighted\r\n    PM₂.₅ concentrations were highest in the WHO South-East Asia Region and then in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Elevated concentrations were also observed in some western African countries, largely due to the impact of Saharan dust. Windblown desert\r\n    dust contributes to sometimes very high exposures to particles larger than 10 µm. This is a prominent issue in many arid areas in the Middle East, northern Africa, the Gobi Desert and elsewhere.. Many of the countries with the lowest national PM₂.₅ exposure levels were either in the WHO Region of the Americas or the European Region. Trends in PM₂.₅ indicate a relatively stable population-weighted global mean concentration, which reflects both\r\n    decreases in exposure in the European Region, the Americas and recently in some parts of the Western Pacific Region, and increases elsewhere."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "How can these guidelines be used?", "answer": "The AQGs provide robust evidence-informed guidance to protect public health from air pollution. Whereas guidelines are not legally binding recommendations, they can be used as an evidence-informed reference tool to help decision-makers in setting\r\n        legally binding standards and goals for air quality management at international, national and local level. Academic researchers and national and local authorities working in the broad field of air pollution may also find them useful for planning\r\n        and impact assessments, and they may stimulate further research and monitoring. They can also be used as an advocacy tool for protecting public health from air pollution, for example by civil society and academic groups."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "What is the difference between AQG levels, interim targets and good practice statements?", "answer": "The AQG levels provide evidence-informed quantitative recommendations, based on systematic review of the evidence of adverse health effects (including an indication of the shape of the concentration–response function)\r\n        for PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂, O₃, SO₂ and CO, for relevant averaging times and in relation to critical health outcomes. Interim targets serve to guide reduction efforts towards the ultimate and timely achievement of the AQG levels. Meeting the interim targets may have a notable benefit for health, especially in those regions where exposures far exceed interim targets. Good practice statements help to manage certain types of particulate matter (i.e. black carbon/elemental carbon, ultrafine particles, and particles originating from sand and dust storms), when numerical AQG levels can not be established in the absence of clear quantitative\r\n            evidence on independent health effects from these pollutants."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "How many lives could be saved or improved if countries achieve new AQG levels?", "answer": "Achieving the recommended AQG levels will deliver substantial health benefits globally. WHO has performed a rapid scenario analysis to assess the health gains attributable to improved annual ambient particulate matter concentrations, if the AQG levels\r\n        were achieved. Around 80% of deaths attributed to PM₂.₅ exposure in the world could be avoided if countries attain the annual AQG level for PM₂.₅. Reaching the interim targets also offers substantial benefits for health. For example, attainment\r\n        of interim target 4 for PM₂.₅ (the same level as the AQG from 2005), would result in a nearly 48% decrease in total deaths attributed to PM₂.₅ exposure. The highest impact would be observed in the South-East Asia and African regions (57% and 60%\r\n        reduction respectively). Results clearly demonstrate a major reduction in the estimated burden of disease, even if other analyses may yield different estimates due to different assumptions made. The WHO scenario analysis showed that if the interim targets were achieved, the greatest benefit in terms of reduced burden of disease would be observed in countries with high PM₂.₅ concentrations and with large populations. Results are significantly different for high-income countries, as in most cases the PM₂.₅ ambient concentrations in these areas are already below the interim targets."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "Is there a link between air quality and COVID-19?", "answer": "Poor air quality is an important risk factor for both acute (e.g. pneumonia) and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or stroke). People with underlying medical conditions are thought to be at a greater risk of developing severe disease from COVID-19 infection; thus, air pollution is most likely a contributing factor to the health burden caused by COVID-19. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, however, there has been an important, albeit short-term, reduction in concentrations of air pollutants across cities. This reduction was more prominent in the case of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), a pollutant very much related to traffic, which was dramatically curtailed by lockdown measures. European data for some cities has shown a reduction of around 50%, and in some cases up to 70%, in NO₂ levels compared to pre-lockdown values. COVID-19 has been a tragedy but, at the same time, the response measures have shown how policies related to transport and the way people work, study and consume, can contribute to a better air quality, something that should be taken into consideration for the post-pandemic recovery policies that many countries are already working on."}
{"topic": "/who-global-air-quality-guidelines", "question": "How does reducing air pollution also support climate action?", "answer": "Some air pollutants – particularly black carbon (a component of PM) and tropospheric (ground-level) ozone – are also short-lived climate pollutants, which are linked with both health effects and near-term warming of the planet. They persist in the atmosphere for as little as a few days or months and their reduction has co-benefits not just for health but also for the climate. Almost all efforts to improve air quality can enhance climate change mitigation, and climate change mitigation efforts can, in turn, improve air quality. Notably, reduction or phase-out of fossil and biomass fuel combustion will reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as health relevant air pollutants. By promoting environmental sustainability hand in hand with public health protection, we can make large steps towards mitigating climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-research-and-development", "question": "How is the research and development process being accelerated without compromising safety?", "answer": "WHO and its partners are committed to accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines while maintaining the highest standards on safety. Vaccines go through various phases of development and testing – there are usually three  phases to clinical trials, with the last one designed to assess the ability of  the product to protect against disease, which is called efficacy. All phases  assess safety. The last phase, phase III, are usually conducted in a large  number of people, often 10’s of thousands.   After that, the vaccine needs to go through a review by the national  regulatory authority, who will decide if the vaccine is safe and effective  enough to be put on the market, and a policy committee, who will decide how  the vaccine should be used. In the past, vaccines have been developed through a series of consecutive steps that can take many years. Now, given the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations are changing how vaccines are developed. This means that some of the steps in the research and development process have been happening in parallel, while still maintaining strict clinical and safety standards. For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time. It is the scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. However, this does not make the studies any less rigorous. The more vaccines in development the more opportunities there are for success. Any longer-term safety assessment will be conducted through continued follow up of the clinical trial participants, as well as through specific studies and general pharmacovigilance of those being vaccinated in the roll out.  This represents standard practise for all newly authorized vaccines. More information about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-research-and-development", "question": "What are human challenge studies? What is WHO’s view on these studies?", "answer": "In a regular vaccine study, one group of volunteers at risk for a disease is given an experimental vaccine, and another group is not; researchers monitor both groups over time and compare outcomes to see if the vaccine is safe and effective. In a human challenge vaccine study, healthy volunteers are given an experimental vaccine, and then deliberately exposed to the organism causing the disease to see if the vaccine works. Some scientists believe that this approach could accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development, in part because it would require far fewer volunteers than a typical study. However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed – particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study. For more information, see this WHO publication on the ethics of COVID-19 human challenge studies ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-research-and-development", "question": "Who should participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines?", "answer": "Small (phase I) safety studies of COVID-19 vaccines should enroll healthy adult volunteers. Larger (phase II and III) studies should include volunteers that reflect the populations for whom the vaccines are intended. This means enrolling people from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19. Including these groups in clinical trials is the only way to make sure that a vaccine will be safe and effective for everyone who needs it."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-research-and-development", "question": "How do I volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial?", "answer": "Opportunities to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial vary from country to country. If you are interested in volunteering, check with local health officials or research institutions or email rdblueprint@who.int for more information about vaccine trials."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation", "question": "As safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are approved, who should be the first to receive them?", "answer": "WHO believes that everyone, everywhere who could benefit from safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines should have access as quickly as possible, starting with those at highest risk of serious disease or death. WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) released two key documents to help guide the allocation and prioritization of populations to receive COVID-19 vaccines: The Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination , which offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries, and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while supply is limited. The Roadmap for Prioritizing Population Groups for Vaccines against COVID-19 , which recommends public health strategies and target priority groups for different levels of vaccine availability and epidemiologic settings. The SAGE Roadmap has now been updated and offers recommendations on how       vaccines should be prioritized in countries with limited supply for       maximum public health impact, taking into account the most recent       evidence on COVID-19 vaccines and on the ongoing supply constraint issues       faced by the COVAX Facility.  This       update reflects data that has become available from clinical vaccine       studies, as well as lessons learned from the early implementation of       programmes. The recommendations include expanding the       groups included in Stage II of the prioritization roadmap to include       pregnant women and children with underlying health conditions, and       updates regarding clinical trials for lactating women. In addition, WHO led the development of a Fair Allocation Framework that aims to ensure that successful COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries. This framework is a key part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator , a global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. The framework advises that as safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for use, all countries should receive doses in proportion to their population size to immunize the highest-priority groups. In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation", "question": "What is WHO doing to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be allocated fairly?", "answer": "WHO is one of the leaders of a global alliance known as COVAX , the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator collaboration, which is working to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that there is fair and equitable access to these vaccines for all countries. COVAX has allocated more than 170 million vaccines across 138 countries according to a framework developed by an expert group that includes ethicists, scientists, and other public health specialists  and vetted by WHO’s Member States. It continues to work to diversify both its portfolio of vaccines and channels for access to vaccines, Under this framework, COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, they have been allocated proportionally  to the population size to all participating countries at the same time, so as to protect those people at greatest risk of infection and of severe disease. In phase II, vaccine will be allocated to target countries with higher threat and vulnerability. WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has provided recommendations about which populations should be prioritized first. These include frontline health and care workers at high risk of infection, older adults, and those people at high risk of death because of underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes. In the second phase of the roll-out, as more doses are produced, vaccines can go to groups less at risk of being infected or of suffering badly. COVAX aims to provide at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 and 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022. The Facility has the possibility to increase those doses by another 1 billion as right of first refusal for several candidates in clinical trials supported by CEPI. Although these doses are not enough for everyone in all countries, it may be enough to end the acute stage of the crisis and put the world on the road to ending the pandemic. The number of countries willing to donate vaccine has been increasing. It is important that they do so using the COVAX mechanism so the vaccine are allocated to countries that need them most. At least one billion doses could be donated by high income countries in 2021. COVAX’s need for doses is greatest right now. Countries with higher coverage rates, which are due to receive doses soon should swap their places in supply queues with COVAX so that doses can be equitably distributed as quickly as possible. COVAX continues to be in close dialogue with countries who have expressed interest in sharing doses with the Facility and expects further announcements on this to take place over the coming weeks and months."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation", "question": "How is WHO helping countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccines rollouts?", "answer": "Along with accelerating COVID-19 vaccine research and helping scale up manufacturing capacity, WHO is working in close partnership with countries, regional colleagues, and other partners to develop needed policies, strengthen regulatory capacity, training courses, and guide countries in all the needed preparations for a programme to deliver COVID-19 vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, and partners are supporting countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine introduction. The Country Readiness and Delivery workstream – which is part of the ACT Accelerator – has developed a toolbox with guidance, tools, and trainings. WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) has issued interim policy recommendations for the rollout of all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use. These recommendations can guide and support country decision-making bodies, such as the National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups, on the optimal use of existing COVID-19 vaccines. WHO has also developed detailed technical guidance and adaptable planning tools and templates to help countries plan for COVID-19 vaccines considering the many aspects of readiness that need to be put in place. These areas include planning and implementation, data and monitoring, supply and logistics, and acceptance and demand. To support initial preparations, a vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool (VIRAT) has been developed and disseminated. It provides countries with an integrated roadmap of milestones and a framework for self-monitoring progress in preparing for vaccine introduction. This will help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines reach those in need as soon as they are available. WHO advises every country to develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines.  Having one plan in each country, that comprehensively describes all elements of the country’s approach to COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be crucial for a coordinated effort. Guidance on developing that plan is available from WHO, including all elements that a country needs to consider."}
{"topic": "/guideline-for-screening-and-treatment-of-cervical-pre-cancer-lesions-for-cervical-cancer-prevention", "question": "What are the recommendations using the “screen and treat” approach if", "answer": "A. HPV as the primary screening test is positive, and when acetic acid is placed on the cervix to determine treatment eligibility no lesion is seen, but the transformation zone (TZ) is incompletely visualized? (Type 3 TZ) When transformation zone is not fully visible because it is endocervical (type 2 or 3 transformation zone), then the patient should be referred for colposcopy and further evaluation The following criteria make a person eligible for ablative treatment. There is no suspicion of invasive cancer or glandular disease (i.e. adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma in situ, AIS). The transformation zone is fully visible, the whole lesion is visible, and it does not extend into the endocervix. The lesion is type 1 transformation zone. What to do when the patient is not eligible for ablation and colposcopy services are not available? Interventions may be constrained by feasibility, training, programme quality-assurance and resources. In the absence of certain infrastructure, such as the availability of colposcopes, large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) or of safe surgical settings, bridging strategies may be considered in carefully selected circumstances, to extend access to treatment rather than provide no treatment . For example, ablation may be an option for a carefully chosen, small type 2 transformation zone where the probe tip will achieve complete ablation of the squamocolumnar junction epithelium – that is, where it can reach the full extent, depth and upper limit of the transformation zone – and where adequate training for selection and follow-up is available. B. VIA is performed as the primary screening test, no lesion is seen, but the transformation zone (TZ) is incompletely visualized? (Type 3 TZ) As above after a VIA positive screening test, eligibility for ablative treatment needs to be assessed. When transformation zone is not fully visible because it is endocervical (type 2 or 3 transformation zone), then the patient should be referred for colposcopy and further evaluation. Note above (question 1A) the criteria to make a person eligible for ablative treatment and also what to do when the patient is not eligible for ablation and colposcopy services are not available."}

{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Does WHO recommend a specific caesarean section rate at country level?", "answer": "No, as explained in this statement ,\r\n WHO does not recommend a specific rate for countries to achieve at population level. The work conducted by WHO found that as countries increase their caesarean section rates up to 10%, maternal and neonatal mortality decrease. However, caesarean section\r\n    rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates. Despite this, mortality is not the only outcome to consider. Other important outcomes would be short- and long-term maternal and perinatal morbidity,\r\n    for example, obstetric fistula, birth asphyxia, or psychosocial implications regarding the maternal¬–¬infant relationship, women’s psychological health, women’s ability to successfully initiate breastfeeding and paediatric\r\n    outcomes. Lack of data prevented the inclusion of these and other outcomes in the WHO analysis."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Does WHO recommend a specific caesarean section rate at hospital level?", "answer": "No, WHO does not recommend a specific caesarean section rate in hospitals. The need for caesarean section at each hospital can vary dramatically depending of the type of population served by the hospital. For example, larger hospitals tend to receive referrals of most complicated pregnancies or deliveries which\r\n    in turn, may need more caesarean sections. On the other hand, some small facilities may not even be equipped to conduct caesarean sections. Recommending a caesarean section rate for all hospitals would be inappropriate."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why can’t a caesarean section rate at population level be applied or used at hospital level?", "answer": "In population-based studies, populations are often defined within geopolitical boundaries (e.g. state, country). A caesarean section rate at population level includes, thus, all deliveries in such a geopolitical area. On the other hand, the medical and obstetric characteristics of the women attending any particular hospital are often different from those of the overall population. This results in different needs for caesarean section, and also different caesarean section rates. For example, larger hospitals often receive referrals of most complicated pregnancies or deliveries which in turn, may need more caesarean sections. On the other hand, some smaller facilities may not be equipped to carry out caesarean sections."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why are more women giving birth by caesarean section nowadays?", "answer": "In the last decades, the proportion of birth by caesarean section has increased in an unprecedented way. This is due to many reasons, which may be country- and culture-specific. Some of the most omnipresent reasons behind this rise are: the fear of pain\r\n    during birth including the pain of uterine contractions; the convenience to schedule the birth when it is most suitable for families or health care professionals; and because caesarean section can be perceived as being less traumatic for the baby. In some cultures, caesarean section allows people to choose the date or day of the birth due to beliefs around luck or that a certain date or day is more auspicious for the child’s future. In a number of countries, there is societal pressure for a perfect birth outcome, and health professionals may be sued when the results of a vaginal delivery are not as expected, which fuels their fear of litigation. In addition, in some societies, delivery by caesarean section is perceived to better preserve the pelvic floor, resulting in less urinary incontinence, in addition to a more satisfactory return to sexual life."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why could caesarean sections be dangerous?", "answer": "When medically justified, caesarean sections can effectively prevent maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, there is no evidence showing the benefits of caesarean delivery for women or infants who do not require the procedure. Although\r\n    caesarean section has become a very safe procedure in many parts of the world, it is not without risk. As with any surgery, caesarean section is associated with short- and long-term risks with potential implications in future pregnancies. These risks\r\n    are higher in women with limited access to comprehensive obstetric care and in settings that lack the facilities and the capacity to properly conduct safe surgery and appropriately manage its complications."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why is a standardized system to classify caesarean sections necessary?", "answer": "Particularly in hospitals, it is important to be able to compare caesarean section rates and outcomes in a reliable manner. For example, doctors and midwives need tools to analyze the impact of their practices, clinical protocols and changes. Historically,\r\n    we have classified caesareans according to their indications or causes (e.g. intrapartum fetal distress, dystocia, failure to progress). The challenge with these types of systems is that their results are difficult to accurately reproduce as definitions\r\n    vary and different doctors may categorize the same caesarean section under different indications. This has prevented meaningful comparisons not only between hospitals but also within hospitals over time. The Robson (also known as the “10 groups”) Classification  system overcomes\r\n    some of the inherent problems of the indications classifications. It is simple, robust, reproducible, and clinically relevant. It allows comparisons and analysis of caesarean section rates more reliably across different facilities, cities and regions."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How can I implement the Robson classification in my hospital?", "answer": "WHO has published the Robson Classification Implementation Manual which will help you to implement and interpret the Robson Classification. The Robson Classification requires minimal resources and it is being implemented\r\n    in many facilities worldwide. The system organizes women into one of 10 categories for which only five obstetric characteristics are necessary. These variables are routinely collected in most maternities worldwide: Parity and previous caesarean section (nulliparous, multiparous with and without previous caesarean section); onset of labour (spontaneous, induced or pre-labour caesarean section); gestational age (preterm or term); foetal presentation/lie (cephalic, breech or transverse); number of foetuses (single or multiple). The use of a simple spreadsheet will allow you to calculate the proportion of women and caesarean section rates in each group."}
{"topic": "/who-statement-on-caesarean-section-rates-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What are the tools available to implement the Robson classification in my hospital?", "answer": "WHO has developed the Robson Classification Implementation Manual which will help you to implement and interpret the Robson Classification in your hospital. WHO has also developed the web-based Robson Platform . The Platform is a global interactive database aiming to facilitate global sharing of perinatal data according to the Robson classification. You can use this platform to share your data and to view and learn from data shared by other maternity units. You can start data-driven conversations with colleagues worldwide to compare, discuss and find insights to improve your practice. The Platform is an initiative of the WHO to increase access and expand the use of the Robson Classification system."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "How does contact tracing work?", "answer": "Contact tracing identifies, and monitors people who have been exposed to someone who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and involves several steps: Defining contacts: Contact definitions may vary by country. WHO defines a contact as a person who has been exposed to someone else who has had recent probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1. face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1  meter and for at least 15 minutes; 2. direct physical contact with a probable  or confirmed case; 3. direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed  COVID-19 disease without the use of recommended PPE; or 4. other situations as  indicated by local risk assessments. Exposure is considered any time between 2 days before to at least 13 days after the case started to show symptoms . For  asymptomatic cases, a contact is anyone who has been exposed between 2 days  before and 10 days after the date on which the sample that led to confirmation  of infection was taken . Identifying contacts: this is usually done through an interview with the person infected with SARS-CoV-2 to find out who they have been in contact with during the period of time described above.  There are other ways to identify contacts depending on the setting, for  example through membership or attendance lists of places the case visited  during the period described above, or through public notices. Digital  proximity tracing applications have also been developed to help identify and  notify contacts through automated processes. Informing contacts: each identified contact should be contacted to confirm whether they meet the definition of a contact. This  may be done through health authorities and/or via digital tracing proximity  applications. Cases may also be encouraged to  inform their own contacts. Each person identified as a contact will be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected), how to undertake quarantine and for how long, and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional information should be provided on symptoms to monitor throughout the quarantine period, and what to do if a contact returns  a positive test or become s unwell. Managing and monitoring contacts : contacts should be encouraged and supported during the quarantine period. WHO recommends that the q uarantine period ends 14 days after the contact was last exposed to the person who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 . However, the duration of the quarantine period may vary between countries. Data processes and analysis: The information collected from each contact is stored in a secure database . These processes vary from country to country. See question What should be considered for data protection?"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "Who is defined as a contact?", "answer": "A contact is currently   defined as anyone who had direct  contact with, or was  within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes, with a person who may be infected or  is infected with SARS-CoV-2 while they were infectious or potentially   infectious , even if the person with  the infection did not have symptoms. National and local public health   authorities may have additional considerations to define contacts according   to local risk assessments. Contacts should be supported  to quarantine to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection if they become ill. (The complete definition of a  contact can be found here )."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "What is backward contact tracing?", "answer": "Backward contact tracing refers to the process of trying to understand how the case   became infected, also known as case or source investigation. While   traditional contact tracing identifies people who were exposed to cases and may   become cases themselves, backward contact tracing or source investigation   looks back in time to identify settings or events where exposure to the virus   may have occurred. This may help public health authorities identify more cases (such as at an event or setting where the case may have   been infected) and identify settings that have led to infection. This can   inform the development of targeted public health and social measures to   reduce the overall number of cases."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "When should contact tracing be implemented?", "answer": "Comprehensive contact tracing should be implemented each time cases or clusters (groups of  linked cases) are identified. During intense transmission, contact tracing capacities may be overwhelmed, so contact tracing activities may focus on household contacts, healthcare workers contacts , contacts in high-risk closed settings ( such as dormitories, institutions, long-term living facilities ), and contacts at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. It is important to maintain contact tracing and quarantine of contacts even when the number of new cases may be decreasing, and/or public health and social measures may be being relaxed , in order to ensure that transmission continues to reduce."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "How do you form a contact tracing workforce?", "answer": "A contact tracing workforce can be   drawn from many settings, including individuals connected with local   government, civil society, non-governmental organizations, universities and   community volunteers. Ideally, a gender-balanced contact tracing team should   be recruited from the community and have general literacy, strong   communication skills, local language proficiency and an understanding of the   local context and culture. They should be provided with   adequate training to ensure efficiency, accuracy and good communication   skills when implementing case and contact investigations, and integrated   within the wider COVID-19 response team. Several training materials have   been developed by WHO and partners and may be adapted to local needs. Many   are available through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) knowledge platform , and OpenWHO . Training should include the basics of virus   transmission, prevention and control measures; how to monitor signs and   symptoms; and standard operating procedures for contact tracing, including   interview tips and ethics of public health surveillance and quarantine.   Contact tracers should also be briefed on their rights, roles and   responsibilities, including for occupational safety and health. It is important for public health   authorities to train the contact tracing workforce when there is no or low   transmission, and anticipate ways to be able to scale the size of the trained   contact tracing workforce, if transmission increases."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "What are some of the challenges to effective contact tracing for COVID-19?", "answer": "Some of the   challenges are the availability of a trained contact tracing workforce,   availability of resources for contact tracing and community engagement. Another main challenge is the intensity of the COVID-19   transmission. In situations of intense transmission, public health resources   can quickly become overwhelmed and often cannot cope with the workload of   identifying contacts and monitoring them. In such situations, WHO recommends   focusing on the contacts with highest exposure and those most at risk of   developing severe disease."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "What are some digital tools used to support contact tracing? How can they enhance contact tracing processes?", "answer": "Classic interview-based contact tracing  relies heavily on the presence of a trained workforce to carry out essential activities such as contact elicitation,  notification and follow-up. However, this workforce can be quickly overwhelmed  in the context of widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Electronic tools and information technology have been  used to enhance the efficiency of contact tracing processes, and are currently being used  in the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, no single digital tool addresses  all the steps required to monitor end-to-end contact tracing and quarantine of  contacts. Oversight from public health workforce is still required. The  technical and ethical requirements related to the use of such digital tools should be considered when making decisions as to the use of  these tools. Digital tools that support contact tracing processes may be  broadly divided into three categories based on their public health function  during specific steps of the contact tracing process: Identifying and  notifying contacts: These solutions are  intended for use by the general public, health professionals and the contact  tracing team. They include digital proximity tracing tools that use systems based on Bluetooth or GPS  location signaling, to notify users who have been in close proximity and  prolonged contact to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and  registered their status in the tool. There are also location-based digital contract tracing tools that use quick  response (QR) codes that can be scanned by smartphones users when they visit a  venue, so that if they later test positive for COVID-19, other application  users who attended the same venue, at the same time may be sent an alert, if  local public health authorities deem it necessary . Monitoring contacts : These tools are intended for use by those   identified as contacts, health professionals and the contact tracing team.   They include symptoms checker tools that can help contacts  to self-monitor   and report the presence or absence of symptoms to health professionals who may   conduct further assessments, health counselling and connect them with the public   health authorities for testing and other supportive services. These tools may   be particularly helpful in settings where contact tracing workforce personnel   may be limited and/or there are physical or security barriers preventing in-person   visits by contact tracing teams. Surveillance data management and analysis: These solutions   are used by public health professionals to collect, manage, analyse and   visualize data collected by contact tracing teams which link cases and   contacts. They include outbreak response tools (such as Go.Data, Commcare, SORMAS, etc.) that can be used   for case investigation, listing and monitoring of contacts, and analysis. It is important to note that these tools cannot  substitute a well-trained health and community workforce, qualified  supervisors, decentralized operations and good coordination; which are all  necessary criteria for successful and effective contract tracing. More information  on digital tools for contact tracing can be accessed here and ethical considerations to guide the use of digital proximity tracking  technologies is available here ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-contact-tracing-for-responders", "question": "What should be considered for data protection?", "answer": "The ethics of public health information, data protection, and data privacy must be considered at all levels of contact tracing activities, including training and use of tools. In particular: Safeguards must be in place to guarantee privacy and data protection in accordance with the legal frameworks of the countries where systems are implemented. Everyone involved in contact tracing must adhere to the ethical principles of handling personal information, to ensure responsible data management and respect for privacy throughout the process. How data will be handled, stored, and used needs to be communicated to those concerned in a clear and transparent manner. This is important for buy-in and engagement as well as to avoid misperceptions that could jeopardize the effectiveness of a contact tracing programme. Digital tools used for contact tracing should be assessed before use to ensure safeguarding data protection according to national regulations . See WHO’s interim guidance   on ethical considerations to guide the use of digital   proximity tracking technologies for COVID-19 contact tracing ."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "Can contact tracing help in controlling spread of the virus?", "answer": "Yes. Contact  tracing is an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease  outbreaks, such as those caused by the COVID-19 virus . Contact tracing can break the chains of transmission through the rapid identification, isolation and clinical care of cases, and providing supported quarantine of contacts, meaning that virus transmission can be stopped."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "Does contact tracing still work against new variants of the COVID-19 virus     ?", "answer": "Yes, the principles of contact tracing remain the same for  newly identified variants of the COVID-19 virus . While some of the variants of the virus are more transmissible, thorough and timely contact tracing and supported quarantine of contacts is even more important to control the spread of the virus."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "How do I know if I’m a contact? What should I do if I am?", "answer": "If you think you may be a contact of someone who has  recently been infected, you should be contacted by health authorities to  determine if you meet the contact definition. You may also be informed  directly by someone you were in contact with who later tested positive. If you  have downloaded a COVID-19 proximity tracing application, you may also get  notified through your mobile phone. If you are  identified as a contact, you should undertake quarantine, which means that you separate yourself from others in your household, stay there and monitor your health for any signs of illness. Some countries have set up dedicated  facilities to enable contacts to complete quarantine outside their household.  Contact your local health authorities to find out how you can safely  quarantine. WHO recommends that you stay in quarantine for 14 days after you were last in contact with the person infected with the COVID-19 virus,  but the duration of quarantine may vary by country. Check with your local or  national health authority."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "How is digital proximity tracing data stored and protected?", "answer": "The data storage for tracing apps can either be stored and processed on a central server managed by the national public health authority, or stored and processed on the users’ phones. There is a consensus by several data protection authorities that storing data on  users’ phones enhance s privacy, since users have greater control over the amount of information that they share with health authorities. The collection and use of such data by health authorities can therefore be limited to what is strictly necessary for the operation of a digital tracing system. Whichever approach is selected, governments and third parties should ensure digital tracing systems  follow WHO guidance on ethical considerations on the use of digital proximity tracing for COVID-19 contact tracing. Protecting the personal data and privacy of individuals participating in digital tracing is critical to ensure the protection of human rights and civil liberties as well as the establishment of public trust."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "What is quarantine? And how is it different from isolation?", "answer": "Quarantine is   the separation of contacts from others after exposure to a probable or   confirmed COVID-19 case – you may or may not be infected. Isolation is   the separation of people who are known to be infected with the COVID-19   virus from other who are not infected. Both quarantine and isolation help to stop the spread of the virus."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "How do I manage quarantine and how do I take care of myself during quarantine?", "answer": "WHO recommends   supported quarantine for 14 days from the last contact with a confirmed case   to minimize risk of infecting others. You should remain separated from others   in the household for the duration of quarantine. If you cannot be in a   separate room, stay at least one metre away from others, the farther the   better . Make sure you have enough food and water, and a way to communicate with others. The quarantine space should be well ventilated.   You should minimize your contact with others. If you do have someone visit   you during quarantine, you should both wear medical masks, keep windows  open if possible and clean your   hands before and after being together. Ideally, you should have only one visitor   provide food and supplies during the quarantine period and this should be   someone at low risk of developing severe COVID-19. Quarantine may cause   worry or anxiety, and this is normal. This can also be an opportunity to take time to care for yourself.   Consider reconnecting with loved ones via telephone or phone apps , watch movies or read books, exercise indoors, make   crafts, or catch up on things you haven’t had time for.  To help you get groceries, medicine and   other necessities, ask family and friends or use delivery services.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "What can I do as an individual to support contact tracing measures in my community?", "answer": "Everyone has a part to play to   bring COVID-19 under control, and contact tracing begins with informed, engaged and enabled communities. Understand the local public health and social measures and  collaborate with health authorities for case and contact investigation. Agree  to monitoring, report signs or symptoms of COVID-19  promptly, and be prepared to quarantine or go into isolation if you become a confirmed case of COVID-19. In addition, you can, while respecting physical distancing  and all other protective measures, provide support to relatives or friends who  have to be isolated or undertake quarantine. Check in on them by phone  or offer to bring supplies to their house, if needed. Transmission of the COVID-19 virus can only be stopped if we all play our role to protect our family, friends and community."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-contact-tracing", "question": "If I’m travelling outside my country, do I need to provide accurate information to contact tracing personnel at the airport or at my destination? What if I’m concerned about how my private information is going to be used?", "answer": "Yes, providing accurate information when requested is important to successful contact tracing   activities. National authorities may ask incoming travelers to report their   health status at the time of travel, possible exposures to confirmed or   probable COVID-19 cases within the previous two weeks, and to provide their contact   details so they can be located for health monitoring or international contact   tracing purposes. Authorities may also require arriving passengers to   download and use a national COVID-19 digital proximity tracing app on   arrival. Please consult national authorities/airline    companies to verify details before you travel."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "What are e-cigarettes?", "answer": "E-cigarettes are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars, e-pipes, e-shishas, etc.  ENDS heat a liquid to create an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, which is inhaled by the user. The aerosols also contain other toxic substances, such as formaldehyde which is a cancer-causing substance. These toxic substances are harmful to both users and those exposed to the aerosols secondhand."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "Are e-cigarettes harmful to health?", "answer": "E-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, lung disorders and other adverse effects. ENDS are often used as complements to cigarette smoking and not as substitutes, especially in smoke-free environments. In the USA, almost 70% of adult ENDS users also currently smoke cigarettes, while the percentage of dual users among young people is lower, at 33%.  Thus, dual use of ENDS and cigarettes sustains nicotine dependence. In combination with tobacco smoking, which is the practice among the majority of e-cigarette users, the health impacts are compounded subjecting the user to increased risk of a variety of diseases. E-cigarettes are particularly dangerous when used by children and adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and can have long-lasting, damaging effects on brain development. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence in some settings that never-smoker minors who use e-cigarettes at least double their chance of starting to smoke conventional tobacco cigarettes later in life."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "Are e-cigarettes cessation aids?", "answer": "The scientific evidence on e-cigarettes as cessation aids is inconclusive and still a subject of debate.  There is also a lack of clarity as to whether these products have any role to play in tobacco cessation at the population level. There is some evidence that smokers can be successful in switching to e-cigarettes but very few are able to stop using these products. Switching from conventional tobacco products to e-cigarettes is not quitting as it still exposes the user to the nicotine and the other toxic compounds in the aerosols of e-cigarettes. WHO relies on sound science and reliable country data to make evidence-based recommendations that best safeguard people’s health. Tobacco users who want to quit should use proven methods to quit tobacco: advice from healthcare workers, toll-free quit lines, mobile and digital cessation services, nicotine replacement therapy (gums and patches) and where recommended, pharmacotherapies (bupropion and varenicline)."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "What support is available to help you quit e-cigarettes?", "answer": "Many e-cigarettes users wanting to quit are already using existing tools such as toll-free quit lines, text message programmes and specialized tobacco dependence treatments to quit. Data from the largest quit line operator in the US (serving 23 States and over 700 employers and health plans) showed that among their 74,646 quit line participants enrolled January 2017-June 2020, 14% of them were using e-cigarettes, 2% of them were exclusive e-cigarette users."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "How effective are quit line services for quitting e-cigarettes?", "answer": "Tobacco quit line services may work well for e-cigarette users. A study conducted by the largest quit line operator in the U.S. compared 6-month quit rates (percentage of people reported free of any combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at 6 months follow-up) between 622 exclusive e-cigarettes users and 29,082 exclusive cigarette smokers who received quit line services during the same time period. The results showed that 16.3% of exclusive cigarette smokers and 19.6% of exclusive e-cigarette users were abstinent from cigarettes and e-cigarettes, respectively, at follow-up. Future research could look at the impact of different interventions including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "How effective are text message programmes for quitting e-cigarettes?", "answer": "Text-message based vaping cessation programmes are effective in promoting abstinence among young adult e-cigarette users. A randomized control trial conducted by the Truth Initiative in the U.S. compared 7-month quit rates (percentage of young adults who self-reported free of e-cigarettes in the last 30 days) between 1,304 participants who received\r\n    the text message support and 1,284 participants who were assessment-only controls during the same period. The results showed that quit rates were 24.1% among intervention participants and 18.6% among control participants, which are statistically significantly\r\n    different."}
{"topic": "/how-to-quit-e-cigarettes", "question": "How to access cessation services?", "answer": "There are many resources within your own community. Check out the WHO Quitting Toolkit to learn about support available\r\n        through healthcare providers, quit line counsellors, text message-based programmes, mobile applications and WHO’s first digital health worker, Florence. If you want to quit e-cigarette use, seek help from your healthcare provider. You can also start by following these four preparatory steps: - Set a quit date: now, today, or ideally within two weeks Tell family, friends and co-workers about quitting, and request understanding and support Anticipate challenges to the upcoming quit attempt, particularly during the critical first few weeks Remove nicotine products from your environment. Prior to quitting, avoid e-cigarette use in places where you spend a lot of time, like work, home or car. And make your home nicotine-free."}
{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What is gender?", "answer": "Gender refers to socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relations of and between groups of women and men [1] .  Gender norms, roles and relations vary from society to society and evolve over time. They are often upheld and reproduced in the values, legislation, education systems, religion, media and other institutions of the society in which they exist. When individuals or groups do not “fit” established gender norms they often face stigma, discriminatory practices or social exclusion – all of which adversely affect health. Gender is also hierarchical and often reflects unequal relations of power, producing inequalities that intersect with other social and economic inequalities. [1] World Health Organization. (‎2011)‎. Gender mainstreaming for health managers: a practical approach. Geneva : World Health Organisation."}
{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What is the difference between gender and sex?", "answer": "Gender interacts with but is different from sex. The two terms are distinct and should not be used interchangeably. It can be helpful to think of sex as a biological characteristic and gender as a social construct. Sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals. Sex is mainly associated with physical and physiological features including chromosomes, gene expression, hormone level and function, and reproductive and sexual anatomy. Sex is often categorized as females and males, but there are variations of sex characteristics called intersex. The term ‘intersex’ is used as an umbrella term for individuals born with natural variations in biological or physiological characteristics (including sexual anatomy, reproductive organs and/or chromosomal patterns) that do not fit traditional definitions of male or female [1] . Infants are generally assigned the sex of male or female at birth based on the appearance of their external anatomy/genitalia. [1] UN High Commissioner for Refugees. (2021).

{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What is the difference between gender, sex, gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation?", "answer": "Gender identity refers to a person’s innate, deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at birth. Gender expression refers to how an individual expresses their gender identity, including dress and speech [1] . Gender expression is not always indicative of gender identity. ‘Transgender’ is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity and expression does not conform to the norms and expectations traditionally associated with the sex assigned to them at birth; it includes people who are transsexual, transgender or otherwise gender non-conforming [2] . Sexual orientation refers to a person’s physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction (or lack thereof) towards other people [3] .  It encompasses hetero-, homo- and bisexuality and a wide range of other expressions of sexual orientation [4] . Sexual orientation cannot be assumed from one’s assigned sex at birth, gender identity or gender expression. [1] World Health Organization. (‎2016)‎.

{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "How do sex and gender influence health?", "answer": "Sex and gender interact in complex ways to affect health outcomes. Sex can affect disease risk, progression and outcomes through genetic (e.g. function of X and Y chromosomes), cellular and physiological, including hormonal, pathways. These pathways can produce differences in susceptibility to disease, progression of disease, treatment and health outcomes, and are likely to vary over the life-course.  For example, data shows that men experience more severe COVID-19 outcomes in terms of hospitalizations and deaths than women.  This is, in part, explained by higher quantities of angiotensin-converting enzyme found in men, which binds to the SARS-COV2 virus. Gender norms, socialization, roles, differentials in power relations and in access to and control over resources contribute to differences in vulnerabilities and susceptibilities to illness, how illness is experienced, health behaviours (including health-seeking), access to and uptake of health services, treatment responses and health outcomes. For example, gender can determine health risks faced and taken. Data show that men’s increased risk of acquiring SARS-COV2, is also linked to their lower rates of handwashing, higher rates of smoking and alcohol misuse and, related to that – higher comorbidities for severe COVID-19 symptoms as compared to women."}
{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "How else does gender link with health?", "answer": "Gender has implications for health across the course of every person’s life. Gender can influence a person’s experiences of crises and emergency situations, their exposure to diseases and their access to healthcare, water, hygiene and sanitation. Gender inequality disproportionately affects women and girls. In most societies, they have lower status and have less control over decision-making about their bodies, in their intimate relationships, families and communities, exposing them to violence, coercion and harmful practices. Women and girls face high risks of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, cervical cancer, malnutrition and depression, amongst others. Gender inequality also poses barriers for women and girls to access health information and critical services, including restrictions on mobility, lack of decision-making autonomy, limited access to finances, lower literacy rates and discriminatory attitudes of healthcare providers. Gender diverse people are more likely to experience violence and coercion, stigma and discrimination, including from health workers. Data suggests that transgender individuals experience high levels of mental health illness – linked to the discrimination and stigma they face from societies and in healthcare settings [1] .

{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What is intersectionality and why does it matter to gender and health?", "answer": "“Intersectionality” builds on, and extends, the understanding of how gender power dynamics interact with other power hierarchies of privilege or disadvantage, resulting in inequality and differential health outcomes for different people [1] . These factors include sex, gender, race, ethnicity, age, class, socioeconomic status, religion, language, geographical location, disability status, migration status, gender identity and sexual orientation. For example, indigenous women have worse maternal health outcomes than non-indigenous women and are less likely to benefit from health care services in Latin America and the Caribbean. Therefore, inequities in maternal health between different ethnic groups should be monitored to identify critical, modifiable, health system and community factors that could limit health care coverage, including language, religion, territory and place of residence. Monitoring health inequities is essential for designing more effective programmes and policies to reduce health risks among indigenous women [2] .

{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "Why is gender equality also men’s concern?", "answer": "Harmful gender norms – including those related to rigid notions of masculinity – affect the health and well-being of boys and men. For example, notions of masculinity encourage boys and men to smoke, take sexual and other health risks, misuse alcohol and not seek help or health care. Such gender norms also contribute to boys and men perpetrating violence against women and girls. They also contribute to violence perpetrated against men including homicide, youth and gang violence, which are among leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young men. Harmful masculinities also have grave implications for men’s mental health. Societal expectations and norms around “manhood” lead men to engage in risk-taking behaviors; for example, being encouraged to have multiple sexual partners. In addition to affecting men’s health, this also leads to negative outcomes for women and children due to increased interpersonal violence, the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. Men’s lack of participation in domestic and care work adds to the high burden of unpaid care work often performed by women [1] . [1] Pan American Health Organization. (2019). Masculinities and Health in the Region of the Americas . Washington, D.C.: PAHO."}
{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What are gender mainstreaming and gender analysis?", "answer": "Gender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications for women, men and gender diverse people of any planned action within a health system, including legislation, policies, programmes or service delivery, in all technical areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making the concerns and experiences of diverse women and men an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all spheres so that they benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. Gender mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a strategy, an approach and a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Gender analysis identifies, assesses and informs actions to address inequality and inequity [1] . It is used to systematically identify differentials between groups of women and men, whether related to sex or gender, in terms of risk factors, exposures and manifestations of ill-health, severity and frequency of diseases, health seeking behaviours, access to care and experiences in health care settings, as well as outcomes and impact of ill-health. Systematically collecting and analyzing data disaggregated by sex and additional factors such as age, ethnicity, socio-economic status and disability, is critical.

{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What does gender have to do with the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?", "answer": "Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ensuring health and well-being for all at all ages (SDG 3) cannot be achieved without addressing the specific barriers and challenges faced by women, men, girls, boys and gender diverse people. Gender equality (SDG 5) is a development goal in its own right and there are 45 targets and 54 gender-specific indicators addressing gender equality across all of the SDGs. Achieving these targets and closing gender inequalities will therefore create a multiplier effect across all of the SDGs and accelerate their achievement. WHO’s work on gender is aligned with and supports the advancement of the SDGs, especially SDG3 and SDG5. The achievement of SDG3 on universal health coverage and SDG 5 on gender equality are co-dependent – without strengthening gender equality in the health workforce, across communities and across the world, universal health coverage cannot be attained. The WHO is committed to non-discrimination and to leaving no-one behind and seeks to ensure that every person, regardless of gender or sex, has the opportunity to live a healthy life."}
{"topic": "/gender-and-health", "question": "What is WHO doing to advance gender equality and to mainstream gender across its work?", "answer": "WHO’s 13 th General Programme of Work (2019-23) recognizes the need to promote gender equality and to mainstream gender in all of the Organization’s work. WHO develops norms, standards and guidelines and delivers training on gender-responsive health service provision and delivery, and commissions research on issues focusing on gender equality, human rights and health equity. WHO also supports country-level action to strengthen health sector response to gender-based violence as well as to address gender equality in health workforce development and gender-related barriers to health services. WHO works to challenge gender stereotypes and to implement programmes, services and policies that promote gender equality in order to achieve health equity and Universal Health Coverage. WHO regularly reports on the UN System-wide Action Plan for Mainstreaming Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-SWAP) to foster accountability and monitor progress towards gender equality.  WHO is committed to increasing diversity and women’s meaningful participation within the Organization at all levels. Institutional policies to promote women’s career development, increase gender parity, end all-male panels, address work−life balance and prevent harassment in the workplace are being implemented in the Organization.

{"topic": "/national-reporting-instrument", "question": "What is the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel?", "answer": "The WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (“the Code”) was adopted by the 63rd World Health Assembly (WHA Res 63.16) in 2010 to strengthen the understanding and ethical management of international health personnel recruitment through improved data, information, and international cooperation. The Code was developed after a six-year negotiation process to address the growing concerns of the adverse effects of international migration of health personnel on source countries. The Code provides ethical principles for the international recruitment of health personnel in a manner that strengthens the health systems of countries, transitional economies and small island states. The Code is non-binding in nature but applies to Member States as well as all relevant stakeholders (health personnel, recruiters, employers, health professional organizations, relevant organizations, public, private and non-government sectors). Although adoption of the Code is voluntary, Member States are required to report on the implementation every three years. To date, Member states were asked to report using the National Reporting Instrument in 2012, 2015 and 2018."}
{"topic": "/national-reporting-instrument", "question": "What are the objectives of the Code?", "answer": "The objectives of the code are to: Establish and promote principles and practices for the ethical      international recruitment of health workers taking into account the      rights, obligations and expectations of source countries, destination      countries and migrant health personnel.

{"topic": "/national-reporting-instrument", "question": "What are the principles of the Code?", "answer": "The guiding principles of the Code are as follows: Member States should take the Code into account when developing their national health policies and      cooperating with each other . Voluntary international principles and the coordination of      national policies on international health personnel recruitment are      desirable to equitably strengthen health systems worldwide, mitigate the negative      effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing      countries, and safeguard the rights of health personnel. The specific needs of countries, especially developing      countries and transitional economies with health workforce vulnerabilities      and capacity limitations to implement the Code, should be considered. Developed countries should provide technical and financial assistance to these      countries to strengthen health systems, including health personnel      development. The right to the highest attainable standard of health of the      populations of source countries and individual rights of health personnel to leave      any country in accordance with applicable laws needs to be taken      into account. International recruitment of health personnel should be      conducted in accordance with the principles of transparency, fairness and      promotion of sustainability of health systems in developing      countries. Member States should strive, to the extent possible, to create      a sustainable health workforce and work towards establishing effective health workforce planning,      education and training, and retention strategies to reduce their need to recruit migrant health personnel. Effective gathering of national and international data, research and      sharing of information on international recruitment of health      personnel are needed to achieve the objectives of this Code. Member States should facilitate circular migration of health      personnel to that both source and destination countries benefit      from their skills and knowledge."}
{"topic": "/national-reporting-instrument", "question": "What are the main highlights of the Code?", "answer": "Ethical international recruitment: The Code discourages the active recruitment of health personnel from countries facing critical shortages of health personnel. Fair treatment of migrant health personnel: The Code emphasizes the importance of equal treatment for migrant health workers and the domestically trained health workforce. All health personnel should have the opportunity to assess the benefits and risks associated with different employment positions. Health personnel development and health systems sustainability: Countries should implement   effective health workforce planning, education, training and retention strategies to sustain a health workforce that is appropriate for the specific conditions of each country and to reduce the need to recruit migrant health personnel. International cooperation: The Code encourages collaboration between destination and source countries for both to derive benefits from the international migration of health personnel. Support to developing countries: Member States are encouraged to provide technical assistance and financial support to developing countries or transitional economies that are experiencing a critical health workforce shortage. Data gathering: Member States are encouraged to strengthen or establish health personnel information systems, including information on health personnel migration, and translate the data into effective health workforce policies and plans. Information exchange: Member States should periodically collect and report to the WHO Secretariat data on laws and regulations related to health personnel recruitment and migration, as well as data from health personnel information systems.  Member States are encouraged to promote information exchange on international health personnel migration and health systems both nationally and internationally. Monitoring of the Code’s implementation: Member States are encouraged to implement the Code in collaboration with all stakeholders. All parties should strive to work individually and collectively to achieve the objectives of the Code. Monitoring the implementation process: Member States should periodically report measures taken on the implementation of the Code, results achieved, difficulties encountered and lessons learnt to the WHO Secretariat. The WHO Director-General will subsequently report to the World Health Assembly on the effectiveness of the Code implementation in achieving its stated objectives and make suggestions for improvement."}

{"topic": "/national-reporting-instrument", "question": "What is the Designated National Authority (DNA)?", "answer": "As per Article 7 of the Code, the Designated National Authority (DNA) is the nominated individual by each Member State who has been authorized to share information on the implementation of the Code and data on international health personnel migration, both nationally and internationally. A registry of DNA is maintained by the WHO Secretariat that is regularly updated before sharing the new rounds of the NRI. The WHO Secretariat communicates with the DNA from each Member State to report on the implementation of the Code and to liaise with National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) focal point on health personnel migration data for consolidated reporting to WHO. The NHWA is a system by which countries progressively improve the availability, quality, and use of health workforce data through monitoring of a set of indicators to support achievement of UHC, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other health objectives. More information on the NHWA focal points are communicated to DNAs directly and also through the WHO regional and country offices."}
{"topic": "/national-reporting-instrument", "question": "What is the Health Workforce Support and Safeguards List?", "answer": "Following the decision of the 73rd World Health Assembly on the WHO Global Code of Practice ( 73/9 ), the WHO Secretariat updated the list of countries for targeted health workforce-support and safeguards to be used in conjunction with the Code .  It replaces the list of countries facing critical shortage of health workforce as identified by the 2006 World Health Report and will be updated every 3 years. The countries in the Health Workforce Support and Safeguard List, 2020 have a UHC Service Coverage Index lower than 50 and health workforce (doctors, nurses and midwives) density below the global median of 48.6 per 10,000 populations. The countries in the Health Workforce Support and Safeguard List should be prioritized for health personnel related development and health systems support, and provided with safeguards that discourage active international recruitment of health personnel. Furthermore, it is recommended that any government-to-government agreement on health worker mobility from these countries should be: Informed by a health labour market analysis to ensure adequate domestic health workers supply in countries; Explicitly engage health sector stakeholders, including ministries of health, in the dialogue and negotiation of relevant agreements; and Be notified to the WHO Secretariat through the respective National Health Workforce Accounts and Code reporting mechanisms."}

In 2016, 479 million people or 9% of the global population were working at least 55 hours/week. That percentage is growing. From 2000 to 2016, in relative terms, the proportion of the population working at least 55 hours/week has increased by 9%. In 2016, an estimated 745,000 deaths and 23.26 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs from ischemic heart disease and stroke were attributable to these long working hours. DALYs are a standard measure of the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. This total burden was roughly equally split between the two causes, with ischemic heart disease and stroke accounting for 47% and 53% of deaths, respectively."}

WHO and ILO established the database, which includes over 2,300 surveys from 154 countries with data on number of hours on average or actually worked per week. This data is almost exclusively collected by countries through their national statistical offices. WHO and ILO conducted two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, supported by a large number of individual experts. Key findings were: Compared with working 35-40 hours/week, working ≥55 hours/week may have led to a moderate increase of an estimated 17% in the risk of acquiring ischaemic heart disease, when followed up between one year and 20 years. This was based on a pooled analysis of 339,680 participants in 22 cohort studies. Compared with working 35-40 hours/week, working ≥55 hours/week may have led to a moderate increase by 35% in the risk of acquiring stroke. This was based on a pooled analysis of 162,644 participants in 7 studies."}

These WHO/ILO joint estimates provide the basis for this. Governments, employers and workers can take the following actions to protect workers’ health: Governments, in consultation with employers and workers, can introduce, implement and enforce laws, regulations and policies that ban mandatory overtime and ensure maximum limits on working time. Bipartite or collective bargaining agreements between employers’ and workers’ associations can arrange working time to be more flexible, while at the same time ensuring that maximum limits are not crossed. A heathy and green recovery from the labour consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could include a sharing of working hours between workers to ensure that numbers of hours worked do not climb above 55 or more per week, to prevent increased risk and burden of cardiovascular disease."}

The first is through physiological responses to psychosocial stress: working long hours continually activates the autonomic nervous system, immune system and, in turn, associated stress responses, with excessive release of stress hormones (e.g. adrenalin, noradrenalin and cortisol). This triggers reactions in the cardiovascular system (e.g., those that results in low heart rate variability and/or sustained high blood pressure) and lesions that cause a change in tissue (e.g., leading to the formation of fatty deposits in the arteries in coronary vessels). The second pathway is through health-harming behavioural responses to stress, which include tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and, in turn, impaired sleep and poor recovery, all established risk factors for ischemic heart disease and stroke."}

There has been a huge increase in teleworking. A 2017 Eurofound and ILO report highlighted the complex association between teleworking and working hours. 1 While partial and occasional forms of teleworking seemed to provide the best balance in terms of benefits and drawbacks, many workers have been teleworking for most of their working week. Teleworking can lead to longer working hours and work intensification. The National Bureau of Economic Research carried out research on 3.1 million workers in North America, Europe and the Middle East in 2020, before and after government-backed lockdowns, and found the average workday increased in length by 48.5 minutes (8.2%) during lockdowns. 2 In a different report, looking at the consequences of the recession in the late 2000s, they noted productivity increased despite a decline in the workforce – the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that one reason for this is that companies could be getting the same output from fewer workers. Further to this, the future of work may also increase workers’ exposure to long working hours. The number of people working in the gig and platform economies has been increasing – a trend that started even before the Covid-19 pandemic. The impact of the expansion of the gig and platform economies is difficult to predict. The possibility of gig work could offer flexibility for workers over their working hours, however, according to an ILO report from 2018, 4 work-time autonomy depends on the availability of work. Additionally, many workers use gig work to supplement their income. Further, the distinction between paid and unpaid work can be blurred for gig workers.  A 2020 paper that collected information from a small number of gig workers in Indonesia found the average working day was 12 hours. 5 They suggested that “platform work can be seen as the latest way for firms to evade employment regulation”, but that more research and evidence is needed."}

WHO supports the ambition of the VGFSyN to address the policy fragmentation across the food system, including its call for greater policy coherence also between agriculture, nutrition and health in line with Agenda 2030 and the SDGs approach. WHO appreciates their important consideration of environmental, social, and economic sustainability of food systems. WHO praises the Committee on World Food Security for its ongoing dialogue with all actors as it is required to ensure the food sector produces, transforms, and markets foods that ensure affordable healthy diets for all through sustainable food systems. The inclusive dialogue and voluntary actions do not replace the need for regulatory action (such as on nutrition labelling, economic tools including taxation, subsidies and other incentives, regulating marketing of foods, especially to children, mandating food fortification where needed, setting limits on the content of sodium, unhealthy fats and sugars in food, and standards for food served and sold in public settings) as part of a comprehensive approach for a successful food systems transformation."}

{"topic": "/sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-traditional-food-markets", "question": "Why are WHO, OIE and UNEP recommending countries suspend trade in live wild mammals for food and close sections of food markets selling these animals?", "answer": "Animals, particularly wild animals, are the source of more than 70% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Traditional food markets, where live animals are held, slaughtered and dressed, pose a particular risk to workers and customers alike. Captured wild mammals carry the highest risk of infections going undetected and affecting humans who are exposed to them through close contact. Suspending trade in these live wild mammals and closing those parts of the market where they are kept or sold will reduce the potential for new, dangerous viruses to emerge and infect humans. Millions of people around the world depend on traditional markets for their food and livelihoods. These measures will protect people’s health – both those working there and those shopping there."}
{"topic": "/sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-traditional-food-markets", "question": "Is the recommendation to suspend the sale of live wild mammals a temporary, emergency measure?", "answer": "WHO, OIE and UNEP recommend suspending the sale of all live wild mammals as an emergency measure. Calling for an emergency measure allows for a quick change to food regulations, which is typically a lengthy process. This suspension may be temporary while national authorities conduct a risk assessment of each market to identify critical areas and practices for improvement, and develop new regulations. These regulations should also include provisions for identifying the source of animals to ensure that live wild animals are not illegally introduced to wildlife farms, as mixing wild and farmed animals could further increase the risk of transmission of pathogens to humans."}
{"topic": "/sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-traditional-food-markets", "question": "Why are captured wild mammals sold in markets a risk to human health?", "answer": "Captured wild mammals come into markets without any way to certify if they carry dangerous viruses. Thus, there is a risk of direct transmission to humans from coming into contact with the saliva, blood, urine, mucus, faeces, or other body fluids of an infected animal, and an additional risk of picking up the infection from contact with areas where animals are housed in markets or objects or surfaces that could have been contaminated with such viruses."}
{"topic": "/sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-traditional-food-markets", "question": "What animals are a part of the suspension and what animals are not?", "answer": "The suspension covers captive live wild mammals, usually small animals, such as civet cats, bamboo rats, raccoon dogs and other small mammals. This does NOT cover farmed wild animals, fish or seafood of any kind, farmed or domestically raised animals (poultry, beef, pork, sheep, goats etc), sale of slaughtered wild animals or their meat."}
{"topic": "/sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-traditional-food-markets", "question": "Why are farmed wild mammals considered safer than those captured in the wild?", "answer": "Farming of wild animals is a common practice in many parts of the world. This is done as a means of providing wild meat (as opposed to, for example, domesticated beef and pork) under more controlled settings. Farms that produce captive wild animals need to be registered, approved, and inspected for animal health and welfare standards by the relevant competent authorities. These measures contribute to reducing the introduction and spread of zoonotic diseases. These controls are not possible with captured wildlife, since their exposure to pathogens cannot be monitored or regulated."}
{"topic": "/sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-traditional-food-markets", "question": "Should I no longer hunt in the wild and eat what I kill?", "answer": "This suspension only applies to commercially traded live wild animals.

{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "What is a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC)?", "answer": "Emergency operations centres (EOCs) perform a vital role in the coordination of information and resources for efficient and effective responses to emergency events. A PHEOC is a type of emergency operations centre that addresses the specific requirements for coordinating responses to public health emergencies such as communicable disease outbreaks. These centres are physical locations or virtual spaces in which designated emergency management functions are performed. An operations centre may be a temporary facility or may be established in a permanent location.  They are often referred to as operations centres, situation rooms or command centres. PHEOCs are supported by appropriate legal authority and regulations, and designed and resourced with sustainability in mind. Experience has shown that timely implementation of a well-resourced PHEOC provides an essential platform for the management of public health emergencies and can help avoid common failings such as lack of clear leadership leading to delayed decision making, mismanagement of resources and poor coordination."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "What is the emergency preparedness exercise?", "answer": "WHO, in collaboration with Member States and international health emergency management agencies, uses PHEOCs to run simulation exercises that act as dry runs to better prepare for health emergencies. The exercises include a variety of forms of training and evaluation, often through scenarios such as a simulated global public health event. Team members will respond to the simulated events in their normal roles in the centre, drawing on established plans, procedures and capabilities. This allows them to practice and maintain critical skill sets, assess the functionality and interoperability of the PHEOC, and to continuously improve the overall efficacy of emergency response."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "What is an example of an effective exercise?", "answer": "In 2018, WHO worked with Member States and international health emergency management agencies in a series of simulation exercises to allow participants to demonstrate and enhance their understanding of these events. In this example, the scenario involved the introduction of a novel virus causing severe acute respiratory symptoms (SAR) in a cluster of disease with high mortality and significant morbidity. Exercises like this provided valuable information used in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "Is the public affected by these exercises while they are taking place?", "answer": "Exercises, depending on the types, do not usually include the deployment of people or goods. They are not meant to affect public or official activity at all. Most personnel involved will participate in the exercises from the facilities they would normally occupy."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "What happens if there is a real-world emergency during an exercise?", "answer": "The exercise will be halted immediately. No essential personnel will be diverted from any type of actual emergency response during an exercise. Participating WHO units and Member States also have the option of withdrawing any of their players from the exercise at any time to address matters or concerns directly related to their public safety missions."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "Are countries required to have a PHEOC?", "answer": "Countries are not obligated to have a PHEOC. However, the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) requires that States Parties develop, strengthen and maintain their capacity to prevent, detect and respond promptly and effectively to public health risks and public health emergencies of international concern. To achieve the mandates of IHR (2005) and to address emergencies that have health consequences (which may be caused by any or all hazards), many Member States are establishing or improving their EOCs to strengthen communications and coordination for effective public health response. In 2012, WHO established the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre Network (EOC-NET) to identify and promote best practices and standards for EOCs and provide support to EOC capacity building in Member States. WHO has been working with EOC-NET partners in developing evidence-based guidance for building, operating and improving public health EOCs."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-simulation-exercises", "question": "What are the benefits of participation for agencies and Member States?", "answer": "These exercises provide an opportunity to test existing country’s plans, procedures and capabilities in a realistic environment to gain an in-depth experience that can only be achieved by practice. The experiences help to identify gaps and areas for opportunity that will ultimately help in the assessment and improvement of Member States’ readiness to respond jointly and effectively to global public health emergencies."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "What is serology?", "answer": "‘Serology’ is the study of antibodies in blood serum. ‘Antibodies’ are part of the body’s immune response to infection. Antibodies that work against SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – are usually detectable in the first few weeks after infection. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or no symptoms. ‘Seroprevalence studies’ are conducted to measure the extent of infection, as measured by antibody levels, in a population under study. With any new virus, including SARS-CoV-2, initial seroprevalence in the population is assumed to be low or non-existent due to the fact that the virus has not circulated before."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "What is the difference between molecular testing and serologic testing?", "answer": "‘Molecular testing’, including polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing, detects genetic material of the virus and so can detect if a person is currently infected with SARS-CoV-2. ‘Serologic testing’ detects antibodies against a virus, measuring the amount of antibodies produced following infection, thereby detecting if a person has previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests should not be used to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, as antibodies develop a few weeks after infection."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "What is the purpose of serologic testing?", "answer": "When a new disease, like COVID-19 emerges, initial surveillance and testing strategies focus initially on patients with severe disease and the use of molecular testing to measure acute infections, as these are the individuals who seek and require health care. This can often miss the fraction of mild or asymptomatic infections that do not require medical attention, and as such, the full extent of infection is not known early in an outbreak. Serologic testing helps retrospectively determine the size of an outbreak or extent of infection in a population under study. Seroprevalence studies give a more complete picture of how much of a population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and will capture unrecognized cases not identified through routine or active surveillance."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "Does the presence of antibodies mean that a person is immune?", "answer": "There are many studies underway to better understand the antibody response following infection to SARS-CoV-2.  Several studies to date show that most people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies specific to this virus. However, the levels of these antibodies can vary between those who have severe disease (higher levels of antibodies) and those with milder disease or asymptomatic infection (lower levels of antibodies). Many studies are underway to better understand the levels of antibodies that are needed for protection, and how long these antibodies last."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "Can people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection be re-infected?", "answer": "To date, there are some reports of individuals who have been reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.  There are likely to be more examples of reinfection reported and scientists are working to understand the role of the immune response in the first and second infection. WHO is working with scientists to understand each occurrence of reinfection and the antibody response during the first and subsequent infections."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "What are the results of seroprevalence studies published to date?", "answer": "There are now more than 200 peer-reviewed publications,  pre-prints,  manuscripts and government reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies. These studies vary in study design, populations under study, serologic tests used, timing of sample collection, and quality. Overall, the population-based seroprevalence reported across available studies remains low, at below 10%. Some studies conducted in areas of known high virus transmission and studies of health care workers in areas of known high transmission have reported seroprevalence estimates over 20%. Available study results indicate that, globally, most people remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology", "question": "What is herd immunity?", "answer": "'Herd immunity', also known as 'population immunity', is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths. Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease. Read the Director-General’s 12 October media briefing speech for more detail. Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as ‘antibodies’, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but – crucially – vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing on the pathogen, breaking any chains of transmission. Visit our webpage on COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail. To safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of a population would need to be vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. One of the aims with working towards herd immunity is to keep vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated (e.g. due to health conditions like allergic reactions to the vaccine) safe and protected from the disease. Read our Q&A on vaccines and immunization for more information. The percentage of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%. The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known. This is an important area of research and will likely vary according to the community, the vaccine, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors. Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.

{"topic": "/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19", "question": "What is WHO’s position on ‘herd immunity’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?", "answer": "Attempts to reach ‘herd immunity’ through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and unethical. Letting COVID-19 spread through populations, of any age or health status will lead to unnecessary infections, suffering and death. The vast majority of people in most countries remain susceptible to this virus. Seroprevalence surveys suggest that in most countries, less than 10% of the population have been infected with COVID-19. We are still learning about immunity to COVID-19. Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we don’t know how strong or lasting that immune response is, or how it differs for different people. There have also been reports of people infected with COVID-19 for a second time. Until we better understand COVID-19 immunity, it will not be possible to know how much of a population is immune and how long that immunity last for, let alone make future predictions. These challenges should preclude any plans that try to increase immunity within a population by allowing people to get infected. Although older people and those with underlying conditions are most at risk of severe disease and death, they are not the only ones at risk. Finally, while most infected people get mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and some experience no disease, many become seriously ill and must be admitted into hospital. We are only beginning to understand the long-term health impacts among people who have had COVID-19, including what is being described as ‘Long COVID.’ WHO is working with clinicians and patient groups to better understand the long term effects of COVID-19. Read the Director-General’s opening remarks at the 12 October COVID-19 briefing for a summary of WHO’s position."}
{"topic": "/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19", "question": "What do we know about immunity from COVID-19?", "answer": "Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks after infection. Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (‘asymptomatic’), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response. Globally, data from seroprevalence studies suggests that less 10% of those studied have been infected, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s population remains susceptible to this virus. For other coronaviruses – such as the common cold, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – immunity declines over time, as is the case with other diseases. While people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus develop antibodies and immunity, we do not yet know how long it lasts. Watch this conversation with Dr Mike Ryan and Dr Maria Van Kerkhove for more information on immunity."}
{"topic": "/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19", "question": "What is WHO’s position on ‘lockdowns’ as a way of fighting COVID-19?", "answer": "Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people. However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence. WHO recognizes that at certain points, some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures, to buy time. Governments must make the most of the extra time granted by ‘lockdown’ measures by doing all they can to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower and enable populations to drive the societal response and more. WHO is hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed, based on the local situation."}
{"topic": "/sars-cov-2-evolution", "question": "What does it mean to say a virus mutates or changes?", "answer": "When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit. These changes are called “mutations.” A virus with one or several new mutations is  referred to as a “variant” of the original virus. The more viruses circulate, the more they may change. These changes can occasionally result in a virus variant that is better adapted to its environment compared to the original virus. This process of changing and selection of successful variants is called “virus evolution.” Some mutations can lead to changes in a virus’s characteristics, such as altered transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease). Some viruses change quickly and others more slowly. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, tends to change more slowly than others such as HIV or influenza viruses. This could in part be explained by the virus’s internal “proofreading mechanism” which can correct “mistakes” when it makes copies of itself. Scientists continue to study this mechanism to better understand how it works."}
{"topic": "/sars-cov-2-evolution", "question": "Should I be concerned about SARS-CoV-2 changing?", "answer": "It is normal for viruses to change, but it is still something scientists follow closely because there can be important implications. All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, change over time. So far hundreds of variations of this virus have been identified worldwide. WHO and partners have been following them closely since January 2020. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect the virus’s properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread more easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more severe disease). WHO and its international network of experts, are monitoring changes to the virus so that if significant  mutations are identified, WHO can report any modifications to interventions needed by countries and individuals to prevent the spread of that variant.  The current strategies and measures recommended by WHO continue to work against virus variants identified since the start of the pandemic. See WHO’s Disease Outbreak News for reports on variants. The best way to limit and suppress the transmission of COVID-19 is for people to continue taking the necessary precautions to keep themselves and others safe."}
{"topic": "/sars-cov-2-evolution", "question": "What is WHO doing to monitor and understand the changes in SARS-CoV-2?", "answer": "Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has been working with a global network of expert laboratories around the world to support testing and better understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Research groups have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and shared these on public databases, including GISAID . This global collaboration allows scientists to better track the virus and how it is changing. WHO’s global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory network includes a dedicated SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group, which aims to detect new mutations quickly and assess their possible impact. WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible and share sequence data internationally to help one another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic."}
{"topic": "/sars-cov-2-evolution", "question": "How does SARS-CoV-2 change when it infects animals, and what are the implications?", "answer": "SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission, but there is evidence of transmission between humans and animals. Several animals like mink, dogs, domestic cats, lions, tigers and raccoon dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after contact with infected humans. There have been reports of large animal outbreaks in mink farms in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 can change while infecting minks. It has been observed that these mink variants are able to transmit back into humans through close contact with the mink. Preliminary results suggest that the mink variants infecting humans appear to have the same properties as other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further research is needed to better understand whether these mink variants will cause sustained transmission among humans and could have a negative impact on countermeasures, such as vaccines. See WHO’s Disease Outbreak News on Denmark ( 3 December 2020) WHO works closely with other organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organisation for Animal Health, to evaluate situations of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and transmission occurring between animals and humans."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Can adolescents catch COVID-19?", "answer": "Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19. While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, asthma, diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurological and developmental conditions are risk factors for severe disease and intensive care admission in children.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Can adolescents spread COVID-19 to other people even if they have mild or no symptoms?", "answer": "Yes. Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill. The virus is spread from person to person through liquid particles such as aerosols (smaller) and droplets (larger) from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from an adolescent infected with the virus.  Therefore, it is important to stay at least 1 meter away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "I was due to get vaccinated for HPV, meningitis or tetanus, but immunization services have been disrupted. Should I be concerned?", "answer": "WHO recommends that countries continue routine immunization services wherever feasible. For example, school-based vaccination initiatives should continue only if infection prevention and control measures are implemented to avoid increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus among the students, school personnel and health care providers. However, vaccines provided to adolescents have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer. It is most important that you receive the second dose at some point in time to be fully protected. Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Should I change anything?", "answer": "For people with chronic conditions such as such as asthma, diabetes, TB and HIV the most important thing is to continue your medication as prescribed, attend recommended check-ups and seek medical help if you have new symptoms. Check with your health authorities and health provider if your regular check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services, such as counselling, may be available remotely. For treatment of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic and ensure continuity of treatment, if movements are disrupted during the pandemic.  Seek advice from your health authorities and health care provider on how to be protected from COVID-19 and continue your treatment as prescribed.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "I am bored having to spend so much time at home. Since I am very unlikely to get severely ill even if I was to get COVID-19, why is it important that I follow the guidelines to prevent transmission such as keeping physical distance from other people?", "answer": "Spending more time at home is difficult and can get boring, but it may help to do something you enjoy. This could be reading a book, playing games or listening to music. Try to stay connected with friends and family every day either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can, or, if you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, by talking in-person while keeping your distance. You can also get involved with your community to help fight the transmission of the virus. At the same time, it is still really important that you reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by washing your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub as often as possible, keeping at least 1 metre (3 feet) from other people, and avoiding crowded places. Even if adolescents with COVID-19 usually do not have symptoms and have mild disease, you might be one of the unlucky adolescents who does get severely ill from COVID-19, or you could spread it to others and be responsible for them getting really ill or even dying. You have the power to make choices that could save lives and together young people can play an important part in fighting COVID-19. Find out more on our main public advice page .

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Some of my friends are not sticking to the rules about physical distancing. What should I do?", "answer": "Explain to your friends why it is important to protect themselves and others by washing their hands, avoiding touching their face, always coughing or sneezing into their elbow, sleeve, or a tissue, and cooperating with physical distancing measures and movement restrictions when called on to do so. Maybe you can share ideas for fun virtual activities that your friends can participate in, and you can encourage them to do them together with you or with other friends. For example, you can encourage them to join YouthAgainstCOVID19 campaign that aims to help teach young people around the world about COVID-19 and what they can do to keep their friends, families and communities safe. This way you are giving them alternatives rather than just telling them to stay at home. But, remember that you do not have control over other peoples’ actions so do not get into an argument or a fight to try to change their minds."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "I know there is a risk of getting COVID-19, but can I still play sports?", "answer": "Yes. You can play sports that are in line with the physical distancing measures and movement restrictions that are in place in your country. If you are able to go for a bicycle ride, or if you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Being physically active is good for your health, both physical and mental. Set up a regular routine to practice activities or sports that do not require close contact with others every day for 1 hour. You can do individual sports, like jogging, walking, dancing or yoga. There are many options to try. You can set up playground games indoors, such as jump rope and hop-scotch, play with your brothers and sisters, and practice some strength training activities, using improvised weights like bottles full of water or sand. If you have access to the internet, you can also join in online active games or fitness classes, or set up your own online physical exercises with your friends or classmates. Find an activity that is fun, can be done within the restrictions that are in place in your country, and makes you feel good. Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and follow the directions of your local health authority. Further resources: Read our Q&A on How to be active during COVID-19"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "COVID-19 makes me really anxious. I feel worried and at times have difficulty coping with stress. What should I do?", "answer": "In situations like a pandemic it is very normal to feel anxious and powerless, and that is ok. Here are a few suggestions on things that could help you proactively manage your anxiety: TIP 1: DO THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BODY AND MIND Your body and mind are connected. Here are some things you can do to keep them healthy: • Stay active! Being physically active is good for your body and can help your mind feel better too. If you can go outside, try a walk, run, bike ride, or any other sport. If indoors, try dancing, stretching, or any other movement you can do. Find what works for you – and do it! • Eat well! Try to make healthy choices about what you eat if you can. • Take notice of yourself and the world around you. This means becoming more aware of your breathing, your body and your surroundings. Try to BE PRESENT in the moment! • Sleep! Try to get the right balance of sleep each night. This will help you grow well, stay healthy, and keep clear thoughts. •  Find things that make you happy and do those things more! Listening to music, reading, playing games, chatting with friends, growing plants, cooking, drawing, playing sports…there are many possibilities! Perhaps even try something new! Just make sure that during these activities you respect physical distancing and other protection measures that are in place in your country. TIP 2: STAY CONNECTED TO LOVED ONES Keep in touch with your family and friends however you can. Use social media, email, phone calls, write a letter! Be creative. And if you can’t connect, then think about a memory of a shared time together. TIP 3: RECOGNISE HOW YOU ARE FEELING Understanding how you feel is important. Don’t ignore it. Sometimes writing your feelings down can help you to describe it. It might sound easy or simple, but try this “I feel ....... right now”. TIP 4: BE KIND TO YOURSELF It is okay to feel however it is that you’re feeling. Putting pressure on yourself to always ‘be happy’ or ‘stay positive’ or ‘stay productive’ can sometimes make you feel worse. Instead, if you notice you are experiencing difficult emotions, try telling yourself: “I feel worried and scared, but that does not mean I am not coping.” “It’s been a tough time, it’s okay to be upset.” “I am feeling [insert how you are feeling] and that is okay.” “These are difficult times, it’s normal to feel upset.” Or think of something to tell yourself that works for you. TIP 5: LISTEN TO YOUR BODY Our body experiences and reacts to how we feel. Do you often get headaches? Do your shoulders, chest, or stomach sometimes feel tense? Try closing your eyes, and listening to your own breathing. Notice how you feel in each part of your body, starting from your head down to your toes. Notice if you are feeling any tightness, pain, or pressure in your body. Being aware of where you are feeling tension can help you release it. TIP 6: TRY USING YOUR BREATH TO CALM YOURSELF Slow breathing is one of the quickest ways of calming down the body when we experience feelings such as fear, worry or anger. Close your eyes and think of a calm place. Imagine yourself there, feeling relaxed. • Focus on breathing slowly. • Breathe in for a slow count of 3 and out for a slow count of 3. • Practice this for a few minutes. How do you feel after? TIP 7: AVOID UNHEALTHY WAYS OF COPING WITH STRESS When you are experiencing difficult feelings, it is important to find healthy ways to take care of yourself.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Schools are reopening in some areas of my country. Is it safe to go back to school?", "answer": "A decision to reopen schools in every country and area is made based on careful assessment of the situation, with consensus among all the key parties involved, including the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents and health and community workers. In addition, reopening of schools is carefully planned and prepared, with all necessary measures in place to protect the safety and health of everyone in the school community. Therefore, if your school reopens, you should feel assured it is safe for you to go back to school – provided that you strictly follow the guidelines and rules that will be provided by your school. Of course, if you have any concerns with going back to school, do not hesitate to speak out to your teachers and parents or guardians.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "What should I do if I missed out on my education due to the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "Your school or place where you are studying are likely to make arrangements for you to catch up on what you have missed when your school was closed. Many schools have put in place accelerated learning modalities to help pupils catch up on learning loss. If your school is still closed, and you cannot attend classes in person, follow the procedures that your school has put in place to give you access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television). If you have access to the internet, you can also consult your teachers and other trusted adults to identify and access reliable online learning opportunities and resources, including those included in the distance learning solutions recommended by UNESCO , the United Nations agency that helps countries improve their education systems. In addition, UNESCO is collecting stories from students, teachers and parents about how they are coping and continuing to learn during school closures. Access those stories, they might inspire you. You can also contact UNESCO and share your story! Find out how to share it here . In places where internet connectivity is a problem, many governments have started to broadcast educational programmes on TV and radio channels during school closures. If you live in such a place, look out for educational programmes on your local TV and radio channels. Further resources: Studying at home due to coronavirus?

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Should I wear a mask at school or when playing sports?", "answer": "You should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise your breathing. However, remember to maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene. Regarding wearing masks in schools and other public places, WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of the virus and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, WHO and UNICEF advise decision makers to apply the following criteria for use of masks in schools (either in classes, corridors or communal areas) when developing national policies: • Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. • For children between six and 11 years of age, the decision to use a mask will vary from place to place, and will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of transmission in the area where the child lives, local norms that influence social interactions, the child’s capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision, and other factors. • Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults. Watch our ‘ How to wear a fabric mask ’ video for a demonstration. Watch our ‘ WHO’s recommended fabric mask materials and composition ’ video for more information.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "I am spending much more time online in social media, playing games and studying. Should I be worried about this?", "answer": "COVID-19 has abruptly pushed many people’s daily lives online, and you may be spending even more hours online than before. While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore, it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like going for a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches, and attention problems. If you experience these symptoms, seek help from your parents or a trusted adult.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "I heard I can be hurt by online contacts. What are my risks and how I can protect myself online.", "answer": "Since you might be spending even more time online than before, it is wise to be aware of some of the risks. First, be careful what content you share online. Risky behaviour, such as sexting or sharing of sexualized content, can expose you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams wear appropriate clothing and avoid using private instant messaging services in your communication with teachers. In addition, it’s important to note that some adolescents – for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online contact is never okay. If in doubt, or if you feel uncomfortable or distressed about some interactions you have online, tell a parent or another trusted adult immediately.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Since my parents stopped going out to work, they have been arguing with each other much more, and in some instances, I have seen one parent harm or hurt the other either verbally or physically. I don’t feel safe at home. What should I do?", "answer": "This is a difficult time. Many people – including perhaps your parents - are worrying about security, health, and money. When people are in cramped and confined living conditions, these tensions and stress can become even greater. It is normal to have disagreements. However, if the disagreements become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action. If you are worried about what is happening in your home, or don’t feel safe, talk to a trusted adult about what worries you, and seek their advice. During an argument or a fight, try not to draw attention to yourself so that you don’t end up getting hurt. It might be useful to have a safety plan in case the violence escalates. This includes preparing a bag with essential items, like clothing, documents and electric charger, and having a neighbour, friend, relative, or shelter identified to go to should you need to leave the house immediately for safety reasons. Arrange with the trusted adult to help you alert the relevant authorities who can help you stay safe, including the police, emergency health services and social services. In many of the countries that have been most affected by COVID-19, essential services are still available, including shelters or protection services. If there are no trusted adults for you to share your concerns with, your country may have helplines, including text services so that you can communicate with someone who can help you or give you advice.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "Is it safe to have sex at this time?", "answer": "There is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through semen or vaginal fluids. However, having sex with someone means that you are very close to them. This puts one person at risk if the other person has COVID-19. Masturbation does not involve another person and carries no risk of COVID-19. Depending on the government guideline, there might be restrictions in place to meet people outside your household, so it is important you follow these guidelines. Your risk of COVID-19 is not increased if you already live in the same household as your sexual partner and you are both taking steps to protect yourself from the virus. Make sure to use condoms and contraception to avoid sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "I don’t like the way someone touches me at home and we are both at home all the time because of the pandemic. What should I do?", "answer": "It is wrong for anyone to do this. And it is not your fault in any way. If you are staying in the same house as the person and/or are dependent on him (it will usually be a man), that may make some of the things that you could do difficult, especially during stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19. Here are some things that you can consider doing to improve your safety while in the house. You could      tell him politely but firmly that you do not want him to touch you and ask      him to please stop. You could      inform your parents or other caregivers or trusted adult in the house      about what is happening. You could      inform a trusted adult outside your home such as a neighbour or a teacher      or family friend or relative. If you have      access to a phone, you could call or text for help and support. This      includes calling hotlines/helplines for children and women who are in need      of help or feeling distressed or subjected to abuse, or calling a child      protection service in your area. Be careful not to leave your phone calls      or text messages where anyone else could access them. If you need      to leave the house immediately because he is hurting or harming you, think      of discretely (without him overhearing) pre-arranging with a neighbour or      trusted relative or family friend to help you leave the house and stay      with them until it is safe for you to return home. If you have been sexually abused or raped and need urgent medical help or care, go as soon as possible to the nearest hospital or clinic to ask for medical care.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "When will this pandemic end so things can go back to normal?", "answer": "We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every person’s contribution in helping stop the spread of the virus. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by not going to school for a while, and other activities, are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures have helped to limit the damage the virus can cause, and bought us time to learn more about the virus and find solutions so that we can get back to a more familiar way of living. This is why it was possible to reopen schools and businesses in many places. It is important that you continue to practice the recommended measures and encourage your friends to do the same to prevent the situation from getting worse.

I am not able to apply for the jobs I wanted, and now that I have a new job I find it hard to be noticed when remote working", "answer": "The anonymity of working from home is really taking a toll on people and it is normal if you are feeling a bit forgotten and lost. It can feel difficult to get the attention you deserve and get your work noticed, especially if this is a new job and you do not yet know your manager and other colleagues well.  If you have a comfortable relationship with your supervisor it may be helpful to discuss whether adjustments to your workload, work schedule or other work-related matters can be made. This conversation could also be held with the person responsible for human resources at work. There are many things you can do to feel more comfortable in the new job while working remotely. Ask your supervisor to access a training on remote working and personal effectiveness skills.  Using your time to access learning and training opportunities can not only help you develop skills for your current role but also prepare you for future roles you may desire. Agree with your manager to have regular check-in calls where you can keep your supervisor aware of accomplishments with an informative summary. If you have regular team meetings use this as an opportunity to flag your key successes, and let your co-workers to know you better. Invite your colleagues with whom you haven’t connected yet to virtual coffee dates. Don’t be shy to volunteer for new projects, and offer help to your colleagues when you can. When solutions to problems are hard to find, it can help to talk through with people who you trust, who may be able to help or can be a person to discuss ideas with - ranging from friends, to our work colleagues or supervisors or HR or to external advisors such as career guidance and job-seeking support. Many public employment offices have moved their services online and can offer you great insights about the labour market, vacancies and training opportunities. If you feel your mental health is taking a big toll and its affecting you much more than expected (such as affecting how well you work) then consider the following 1) engaging in stress management techniques – as reduced stress can help to improve our problem solving thinking (see Doing What Matters in Times of Stress and Managing work-related psychosocial risks during the COVID-19 pandemic ); 2) if you are still in work, consider reaching out to your staff health or human resources services who may be able to help you find to mental health and psychosocial support at work or through your local health services including online support.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-adolescents-and-youth", "question": "What can we do so that other diseases like COVID-19 do not affect us in future?", "answer": "COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease which means that it existed naturally in animals before it spilled over to humans. Most new or emerging infectious diseases —whether in wildlife, domestic animals, plants or people — are driven by human activities that lead to environmental degradation. Human pressures, from deforestation, to intensive and polluting agricultural practices, to unsafe management and consumption of wildlife, increase the risk of new or emerging infectious diseases. This is why the number of emerging infectious disease outbreaks has increased steadily since 1980. To prevent the disastrous effects of emerging infectious diseases, we have to recognize that human health is intimately connected to the health of animals and our shared environment, and take action. Millions of young people have already mobilized to demand action not only on climate and biodiversity - but also for the right to breathe clean air, and for their future on a liveable planet.

{"topic": "/what-is-dual-use-research-of-concern", "question": "What is dual-use research of concern?", "answer": "Dual-use research of concern (DURC) describes research that is intended to provide a clear benefit, but which could easily be misapplied to do harm. It usually refers to work in the life sciences, but the principles are also applicable to other fields including engineering and information technology. It encompasses everything from information to specific products that have the potential to create negative consequences for health and safety, agriculture, the environment or national security. The possibility that research might be misused, either intentionally or accidentally, is a long-standing concern of science. It can have implications in ethics and wider societal issues, and involves not only research communities and public health, but also donors, scientific publishing and public communication. One example is research into viruses and other pathogens. Scientists often create modified versions of dangerous viruses in laboratories to study how they behave in humans and animals, and ultimately how to fight them. While this is a necessary step in biological research, the modified viruses also pose safety concerns and have the potential to cause great harm if not controlled correctly or used to intentionally infect people or animals. Another example is pharmaceutical research and development. Scientists researching asthma have developed aerosol methods that help deliver drugs deeper into the lungs. While this research may hold great benefits for people with asthma and other respiratory issues, they could also be used to increase the damage of biological weapons such as anthrax."}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "What are soil-transmitted helminths (STH)?", "answer": "Helminth is a technical name for worm. There are 3 species of STH which are particularly critical in terms of public health: Roundworm, Whipworm and Hookworm."}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "How do I get soil-transmitted helminths (STH)?", "answer": "A person who is infected with STH has parasite eggs in their faeces. In areas where there is no proper latrine system, the soil around the village or living area becomes contaminated with faeces containing these worm eggs. In the soil the eggs mature: this takes from between 2 and 4 weeks. They can then infect humans in two ways: eggs stick to vegetables grown in the area. If the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled, the eggs are ingested and infect the person; young children often play in the soil and put their hands in their mouths without washing them. In this way they ingest the eggs and become infected. You can also become infected by: drinking unclean water which has STH eggs in it; >walking barefoot on contaminated soil. The eggs hatch into larvae which can penetrate the skin of people walking barefoot (this is only true for hookworms)."}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "How do I avoid getting STH?", "answer": "Drink clean water and wash, cook or peel food carefully before eating it. Wash your hands before eating. Wear shoes. There is no direct person-to-person transmission, or infection from fresh faeces, because eggs passed in faeces need about 3 weeks to mature in the soil before they become infective."}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "What are the symptoms of STH?", "answer": "Most of the symptoms of STH infections are very nonspecific and \r\nonly become evident when the infection is particularly severe. The \r\nnonspecific symptoms include nausea, tiredness, abdominal pain and loss \r\nof appetite. Sometimes you will see worms in your faeces."}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "What are the health problems caused by STH?", "answer": "Anaemia: Hookworms live in the intestine. They attach \r\nthemselves to the intestine wall and feed on blood from the cut vessels \r\nand mucosal tissues. This blood loss causes anaemia. Vitamin A deficiency: Worms need vitamin A to live. In \r\nmany countries, people do not eat enough vitamin A-rich foods. In these \r\nsituations, the limited amount of vitamin A that is eaten is taken by \r\nthe worms. Learning: Worm infected children are less able to concentrate or memorize information. They score less well in school tests. Intestinal obstruction: If a person is constantly infected\r\n over a long period of time, the number of worms in that person's \r\nintestine steadily increases. Eventually the number of worms can become \r\nso great that they block the intestine and the only option at that stage\r\n is surgery. This is usually the case for small children whose \r\nintestines are still relatively narrow."}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "If I think I have STH, how do I treat them?", "answer": "Treatment is very simple and safe. Take one dose of any of the following four drugs. If you live in an area where worms are a problem, it is a good idea to treat yourself regularly (e.g twice a year). Dose by age 1−2 years 2 years upwards Albendazole ( 400 mg tablet ) 1/2 tablet 1 tablet Mebendazole ( 500 mg tablet ) 1 tablet Dose by age 1−5 years 1−12 years 12 years upwards Levamisole (40 mg tablet) 2.5mg/kg 2 tablets 2.5mg/kg Pyrantel (250 mg tablet) 10mg/kg"}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "If I am pregnant, is it safe to take the drugs?", "answer": "Yes, the drugs are safe and WHO recommends that if you have worms, you should be treated, even if you are pregnant. As a general precaution, WHO recommendations state that all drugs should be taken after the first trimester"}
{"topic": "/soil-transmitted-helminths", "question": "I am going on holiday to a country where I think worms are a problem, should I be concerned ?", "answer": "First, you can easily avoid getting schistosomiasis by not swimming in fresh water in areas where schistosomiasis is likely to occur. Second, worms (both schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths \r\n(STHs) do not cause a life-threatening disease for someone who is \r\ngenerally healthy and then becomes infected. The disease is only serious\r\n for people living in endemic areas who become constantly reinfected and\r\n have no access treatment. Third, if you get infected, the treatment is easy and safe."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "Why is environmental surveillance of wastewater important during disease outbreaks?", "answer": "Testing wastewater has a long history of use in public health. Environmental surveillance is already used to detect poliovirus in high risk settings, monitor antimicrobial resistance and complement surveillance for other public health programmes."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "How is wastewater testing used for COVID-19?", "answer": "Wastewater testing can be used to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in untreated sewage.  Several countries are monitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, in a range of locations for different purposes. These include: early warning for COVID-19 cases in a community; detection of COVID-19 in locations with weak clinical surveillance; monitoring circulation of the virus during outbreaks; or to trigger case-finding in locations where there are or may be suspected cases, such as quarantine hotels, university campuses or prisons. Some countries are also analysing historical wastewater samples for evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 circulation."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "What does it mean when a wastewater sample tests positive for SARS-CoV-2?", "answer": "Molecular tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus via fragments of genetic material (RNA) in wastewater. Finding this RNA in wastewater means that one or more people in the community likely excreted virus through urine, faeces or by coughing or sneezing. The RNA suggests that the virus was in the community at the time it was excreted. However, the wastewater test does not identify who was or is infected or indicate if the persons excreting the virus are still infectious to others."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "Can I get sick with COVID-19 through contact with urine, faeces or sewage?", "answer": "While fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) have been detected in the urine or faeces of some patients, there have been no reports to date of transmission of COVID-19 through urine or faeces. It remains important to protect yourself with personal protective equipment whenever contact with bodily fluids may occur and to clean your hands frequently Infectious SARS-CoV-2 has also not been detected in wastewater, suggesting transmission through contact or contamination with sewage is highly unlikely. Guidance for water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management can be found here."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "Can I get sick with COVID-19 from swimming in the sea, rivers, lakes or swimming pools?", "answer": "Available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not spread from water. Natural bodies of water and swimming pools do not appear to pose a risk for COVID-19 transmission even if polluted by faeces or wastewater. Pools are usually treated regularly to prevent contamination with a range of pathogens which could be present. However, crowded beaches or swimming pools do pose a risk of spreading COVID-19 through close contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. To reduce the risk of this transmission, clean hands frequently, stay at least 1 metre away from others in and out of the water, and wear a mask when this distancing is not possible."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "Can I get sick with COVID-19 from drinking water?", "answer": "The risk coronaviruses pose to drinking water is considered to be low and SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in drinking water supplies. Drinking water treatment methods neutralize infectious pathogens present in the water. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, which means it has a fragile fatty envelope that is easily destroyed by the treatment process. Therefore, treated drinking water does not pose a risk for COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "Can wastewater testing be conducted in low-resource settings?", "answer": "Putting in place wastewater testing requires a good understanding of how environmental surveillance could add value in monitoring the spread of disease. The laboratory capacity needed to test wastewater samples may be limited in some settings. Clinical testing and epidemiological surveillance are higher priority strategies, as they lead directly to public health measures that can reduce transmission. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities are also top public health priorities, such as ensuring access to hand washing facilities for all. The cost-benefit of wastewater testing relative to other public health measures should be carefully evaluated."}
{"topic": "/environmental-surveillance", "question": "Does WHO recommend environmental surveillance of wastewater for COVID-19?", "answer": "At present more evidence is needed regarding use of environmental surveillance for COVID-19. Wastewater monitoring may be considered as an optional and complementary approach to COVID-19 surveillance in addition to more standard clinical surveillance.  Scientists and public health authorities continue to assess effectiveness and validate testing methods in different settings. WHO encourages efforts to continue to explore potential uses of wastewater testing and recognizes its potential as an emerging tool for improving control of COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/why-is-the-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-important", "question": "Why is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities important?", "answer": "There are around 1 billion people with disability in the world. They are often the poorest of the poor. The stigma and discrimination they suffer are common in all societies. People with disability are often denied chances to work, attend school and participate fully in society - which creates barriers for their prosperity and well-being. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is important because it is a tool for ensuring that people with disability have access to the same rights and opportunities as everybody else. The Convention is a human rights treaty designed by representatives of the international community - including people with disability, government officials, representatives of nongovernmental organizations and others - to change the way people with disability are viewed and treated in their societies. The Convention challenges people worldwide to understand disability as a human rights issue. The Convention covers many areas where obstacles can arise, such as physical access to buildings, roads and transportation, and access to information through written and electronic communications. The Convention also aims to reduce stigma and discrimination, which are often reasons why people with disability are excluded from education, employment and health and other services. For the first time, a legally binding international instrument now exists to guarantee that States that have ratified the treaty will promote and protect the rights of people with disability. These States will next work on passing their own national civil rights legislation to improve the lives of people with disability."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What is the role of National Regulatory Authorities for implementing universal health coverage and achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030?", "answer": "Effective regulatory systems are essential for strengthening health systems and contribute to better public health outcomes. Similarly, regulators are essential to include in the health workforce. Inefficient regulatory systems constitute a barrier to\r\n    access safe, effective and quality medical products. Thus, effective regulatory systems are necessary for implementing universal health coverage, responding to the dual burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases, and achieving the United Nations\r\n    (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, namely, SDG 3.8 which relates to ‘access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all’."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "How do the World Health Organization Prequalification and the Regulatory System Strengthening programmes contribute to equitable access to safe, effective, quality and affordable medical products?", "answer": "As an agency of the United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO) plays a pivotal role in supporting countries to strengthen their regulatory systems for medical products and in promoting equitable access to safe, effective, quality and affordable\r\n    medical products. The WHO Constitution affirms that ‘the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being’. Towards this end, the Constitution calls for the Organization to address\r\n    the request by Member States to strengthening their health services. The WHO Prequalification Programme (PQP) is on mechanism to ensure that medical products purchased by UN and other procurement agencies are of assured quality. The WHO Regulatory\r\n    Systems Strengthening (RSS) Programme supports Member States to develop and expand access to quality, safe and efficacious medical products."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What are the objectives of the WHO Prequalification Programme?", "answer": "WHO Prequalification programme, aims at ensuring that medical products meet global standards of quality, safety and efficacy; thereby, optimizing the use of health resources and improving health outcomes. The Prequalification process consists of a transparent, scientifically sound assessment that includes dossier review, consistency testing, performance evaluation, and site visit to manufacturers. These and other procurement criteria are used by the UN and other procurement agencies to make evidence-based decisions on purchasing assured quality medical product."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What is the WHO mandate to strengthen regulatory systems in Member States?", "answer": "Several are the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions that mandate WHO to address the need to promote and monitor the quality, safety, efficacy and affordability of medical products. However, WHA67.20 specifically mandates WHO to assists Member States\r\n    in strengthening their regulatory system via: evaluating national regulatory systems; applying WHO evaluation tools; generating and analysing evidence of regulatory system performance; facilitating the formulation and implementation of institutional development plans; and providing technical support to national regulatory authorities and governments."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What is the current link between the WHO Regulatory System Strengthening and the Prequalification Programmes?", "answer": "The WHO Regulatory System Strengthening programme aims at building regulatory capacity in Member States most in need. Currently, the WHO Prequalification (PQ) programme relies on acceptable minimum regulatory capacity (formerly called ‘functionality’)\r\n    as one of the eligibility criteria for vaccine prequalification. At present, the WHO PQ of other product streams i.e. medicines, medical devices and diagnostics is de-linked as eligible criteria for the RSS programme."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What is the WHO model to build regulatory capacity in Member States?", "answer": "The WHO capacity building model of regulatory systems consists of five steps: Development and maintenance of a benchmarking tool for assessing NRAs; Benchmarking of the regulatory system; Formulation of Institutional Development Plans (IDP); Building capacity through technical support, training, and networking; and Continuous monitoring and documentation of programme outcomes and impact. The WHO National Regulatory Authority (NRA) Global benchmarking Tool (GBT) is a corner stone of the capacity building model to strengthen regulatory systems in implementation of WHA 67.20."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What is the objective of WHO benchmarking?", "answer": "The objective is to strengthen regulatory systems in Member States to achieve minimum regulatory capacity for medical products that meets acceptable internationally recognized standards. The WHO Prequalification Programme for vaccines recognizes the minimum\r\n    regulatory capacity as one of the eligibility criteria for prequalification. Concepts of cooperation, convergence, transparency, networking, and work-sharing are embedded the WHO benchmarking. Using the WHO Global benchmarking tool, regulatory strengths,\r\n    areas for improvement with recommendations are identified in the form of Institutional Development Plans (IDP) for implementation by the Member State with technical support by WHO."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What are the targeted medical products for WHO RSS programme?", "answer": "They are medical products and health technologies that include medicines, vaccines, medical devices and diagnostics."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What are the regulatory functions benchmarked by WHO to ensure an independent and competent regulatory oversight of medical products?", "answer": "WHO recommends a set of regulatory functions to be undertaken by National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) that support all medical products. These regulatory functions operate under the umbrella of a national regulatory system. Common regulatory functions\r\n    include registration and marketing authorization, pharmacovigilance, market surveillance and control, licensing premises, regulatory inspection, laboratory access and testing, and clinical trials oversight. A  unique function for vaccines and\r\n    blood products is lot release. All functions can be assessed using the GBT and catered to relevant priorities and expectations of the Member State."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "How does the WHO benchmarking process work?", "answer": "The WHO benchmarking represents a continuous process that starts with a pre-visit which progresses towards self-benchmarking, formal benchmarking, and follow-up visits. In accordance with the benchmarking policy, benchmarking is not only used for initial\r\n    fact finding, but also for monitoring progress in the regulatory systems through periodic follow ups. Activities complementing the WHO benchmarking includes pharmacovigilance field visits and GMP observed audits."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What are the expected outcomes in WHO benchmarking?", "answer": "Benchmarking is not an objective in itself, rather, it is a means by which the status of the regulatory system is assessed and documented; strengths and gaps are highlighted; and most importantly, an institutional development plan (IDP) is formulated.\r\n    As such, the benchmarking outcomes extend beyond the responses to assessment criteria supported by evidence, to encompass the IDP or roadmap to implement recommendations to strengthen the regulatory system."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "What is the expected impact of the Regulatory Systems Strengthening programme?", "answer": "The main expected impact is to raise and/or maintain the functionality of the regulatory systems up to a minimal/ optimal capacity level that meets WHO standards. Sustainability of impact is a goal for WHO in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This\r\n    may be achieved for certain regulatory areas by relying or recognizing advanced regulatory system that perform at higher maturity levels. Achievement of regulatory maturity level 3 by the national regulatory authority of a Member State in the area of vaccine regulation, allows domestic vaccine manufacturers to apply for WHO vaccine prequalification. This event alone will have an important\r\n    impact on global access to affordable and assured quality vaccines."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "Is there guidance for performing WHO benchmarking?", "answer": "Guidance on organization, preparation, conduct and reporting of the benchmarking activities exists. The benchmarking manual outlines clear roles and responsibilities of WHO levels (Headquarters, Regional Offices, and Country Offices) as well as guidance\r\n    on the use of the WHO Global Benchmarking Tool. The manual is complemented with other manuals for relevant benchmarking activities (e.g. self-benchmarking workshop, observed audit and vigilance field visits). The manual and factsheets provide clear\r\n    and detail information to organizers, assessors and NRAs. Furthermore, the benchmarking guidance incorporates the WHO or other internationally recognized references and standards."}
{"topic": "/q-a-rss", "question": "How long does it take for a regulatory system to reach minimum capacity that meets internationally recognized standards?", "answer": "It depends on existing regulatory capacity, availability of resources and political commitment. Other factors include the scope of regulatory activities (i.e. medicines, vaccines), size of the market and organizational structure that affect timelines\r\n    for improvements.  For low resource regulatory systems, it may be a long process to reach a system which meets minimum capacity. Therefore, developing a medium to long term strategic plan aligned with national health and medicine policy is a\r\n    critical step towards having a functional system."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "When should a UTN be obtained?", "answer": "It is recommended that the UTN be obtained as soon as the first draft of the protocol has been compiled, although it can be obtained either sooner or later. For example: as soon as an investigator has an idea as soon as the idea becomes a research proposal at the time the first draft of the protocol is compiled at the time the first meeting is held to discuss the protocol at the time the first meeting of potential investigators is held A UTN may be obtained later in the trial's history (e.g. at the time of submission to the first ethics committee, or at the time of submission to a funding agency). It is likely to be more effective in unambiguously identifying a trial, though, if it is obtained early."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "How can we obtain a UTN?", "answer": "Go to https://trialsearch.who.int/utn.aspx and follow the instructions. The process of obtaining a UTN involves 2 stages: applying for and obtaining a security code applying for and obtaining the UTN To apply for the security code, the applicant will need to provide: the name of the individual submitting the request (Requestor) the email address of the individual submitting the request the Requestor's organization An email containing a secure hyperlink will then be sent to the email address entered. You should click on the hyperlink which will take you to the 'Get UTN' web site, where you should click on 'Get UTN'. The UTN will then be sent to you in an email."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "Who should obtain the UTN?", "answer": "The Sponsor, the Principal Investigator or other appropriate person (for example, the administrator of a collaborative trials group) should obtain a UTN for each trial."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "How many UTNs should a trial have?", "answer": "One only."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "What should we do with the UTN?", "answer": "You should use it every time you need to identify the trial. The UTN should be submitted whenever the trial is registered. It may be entered into a field dedicated specifically to the UTN, or it may be entered into the secondary identifier field."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "Is the UTN mandatory?", "answer": "No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries may choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a trial on their registry."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "What should we do if a trial registry does not have a separate field for the UTN?", "answer": "If a trial registry does not have a specific field for the UTN, enter it in the secondary identifier field."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "How will the UTN work?", "answer": "The UTN will be one of many identifiers that a trial may have, just as a driving license number may be one of many identifiers that an individual human has. Even though a single object has multiple identifiers, each one may play a role in helping to identify the object. When an individual applies for a passport, for example, they may be required to show 3 forms of identification (such as driving license number, a credit card number, a utilities bill number) to verify that an individual exists. Similarly, when a trial is registered, multiple identifiers may be able to help us to verify that a trial exists. The UTN will help us to unambiguously identify a trial by enabling us to link (or \" bridge \") multiple records on the same trial together on the ICTRP search portal."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-number", "question": "What if my trial was registered before the UTN?", "answer": "We recognize that in some circumstances, a trial registered prior to the inception of the UTN may request retrospective assignment. UTN numbers may be issued for previously registered trials. In order to avoid duplication of records and permit accurate record bridging on the ICTRP, it is strongly suggested that only the coordinating centre apply for the UTN. Once the UTN has been assigned, the coordinating centre should update all records within primary registers and on all other documentation (e.g., ethical review committee submissions, letters, etc) to reflect the UTN. Remember a trial, no matter how many sites should have only one UTN. Circumstances where retrospective UTN applications may be considered are: proposal, registered (not yet enrolling) trial registered and enrolment terminated trial registered, still enrolling, no new sites trial registered, still enrolling, adding a new site As the primary purpose of the UTN is to identify a trial through stages of a clinical trial (including registration, approvals, trial recruitment, and participant follow up), the utility of a UTN following trial completion and/or publication is currently limited. While it is possible to apply for a UTN, it is again strongly suggested that this be a centralized process and that all documentation be linked to the UTN, retrospectively."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "What are persistent organic pollutants (POPs)?", "answer": "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals of global concern due to their potential for long-range transport, persistence in the environment, ability to bio-magnify and bio-accumulate in ecosystems, as well as their significant negative effects on human health and the environment. The most commonly encountered POPs are organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT, industrial chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) as well as unintentional by-products of many industrial processes, especially polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF), commonly known as dioxins."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "How are people exposed to POPs?", "answer": "Humans are exposed to these chemicals in a variety of ways: mainly through the food we eat, but also through the air we breathe, in the outdoors, indoors and at the workplace. Many products used in our daily lives may contain POPs, which have been added to improve product characteristics, such as flame retardants or surfactants. As a result, POPs can be found virtually everywhere on our planet in measurable concentrations. POPs bio-magnify throughout the food chain and bio-accumulate in organisms. The highest concentrations of POPs are thus found in organisms at the top of the food chain. Consequently, background levels of POPs can be found in the human body. Human exposure - for some compounds and scenarios, even to low levels of POPs - can lead to many health effects including increased cancer risk, reproductive disorders, alteration of the immune system, neurobehavioural impairment, endocrine disruption, genotoxicity and increased birth defects."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "Are POPs found in breastmilk?", "answer": "Through its GEMS/Food Programme, WHO has collected and evaluated information\non levels of persistent organic pollutants in foods, including breastmilk,\nsince 1976. Over the period 1987-2003, it has coordinated three international\nstudies of breastmilk to assess the levels and trends of polychlorinated\ndibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated\nbiphenyls. Analysis of breastmilk, maternal blood and adipose tissue are all\nrelevant matrices for assessment of body burdens for persistent organic\npollutants. However, breastmilk is recognized as the preferred matrix because\nhas several important advantages. Biomonitoring of breastmilk data can provide\ninformation on the exposure of the mother as well as the infants. Furthermore,\nsuch information provides guidance on the need for measures to reduce levels of\nthis substances in food, which is the main source of exposures for most people.\nMore recently, it has been recognized that breastmilk is an ideal matrix to\ngenerally monitor levels of persistent organic pollutants in the environment. In 2004, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was\nratified by governments to decrease environmental and human exposure to twelve\npriority substances in this class. The revised WHO guidelines for developing a\nnational protocol describe the basic study design that can be used to monitor\nhuman exposure over time in order to, among other things, see if the Stockholm\nagreement is actually effective in reducing the release of these chemicals into\nthe environment. These guidelines continue to support the monitoring of\npersistent organic contaminants for human health and food-chain contamination\npurposes. The protocol was designed based on the advice of experts in the field\n(see ad hoc WHO Breastmilk Survey Advisory Group) and on extensive experience\nof certain countries in undertaking similar surveys using human samples,\nincluding breastmilk. In order to promote reliability and comparability,\nparticipating countries are encouraged to adhere as closely to this protocol as\npossible. Ethical issues, including informed consent of donors and\nconfidentiality, are major considerations in this protocol. Given that\nbreastfeeding reduces child mortality and has health benefits that extend into\nadulthood, every effort has been made to protect, promote and support\nbreastfeeding in the context of these studies."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "Are PCBs and dioxins found in salmonour food supply?", "answer": "A survey reported in the journal Science (09 January 2004) compared\nthe level of organochlorine contaminants, including PCBs and dioxins, in farmed\nversus wild salmon collected from around the world. Most organochlorine\nsubstances analysed in the study show a significantly higher level of\ncontamination in farmed than in wild salmon. This study is the largest conducted so far, in particular relating to the\ndirect comparison between farmed and wild salmon. The results reported\nspecifically for dioxins and PCBs are well within the range of previous\nstudies. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are important substances that can\naffect human health. They are persistent environmental pollutants that enrich\nvia the food chain. Dioxins and PCBs are associated with industrial discharges,\nincluding discharges into the sea, and ocean fish have varying levels of these\nsubstances often directly related to the proximity of their habitat to\ndischarge areas. The level in farmed fish normally reflects the contamination\nlevel of the feed used, which has been also shown in above mentioned study by\nthe detection of dioxins and PCBs in commercial fish feed."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "Is it safe to consume foods contaminated with POPs?", "answer": "WHO, in collaboration with FAO, has considered dioxins and dioxin-like\ncompounds on several occasions. Most recently in June 2001, the Joint FAO/WHO\nExpert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) examined new evidence on the\ntoxicity of these chemicals and established a Provisional Tolerable Monthly\nIntake (PTMI) of 70 picograms of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. When evaluating\nstandard diets in different parts of the world the results indicated that the\nestimated intakes of these chemicals approach or exceed this PTMI. Based on the\nmean contamination levels reported in above study, eating one or two portions\nper week of farmed salmon would result in a monthly intake below this level.\nHowever, an overall dietary risk assessment would require inclusion of other\ndietary sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "What is being done to prevent POPs contamination?", "answer": "To address the risks associated with these substances, several steps have\nbeen taken to reduce or eliminate emissions of dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and\nother related persistent organic pollutants. Many countries have now\nimplemented the Stockholm Convention on POPs (2001), which suggests ending\ncommercial use of 12 POPs and reduce or eliminate their emission into the\nenvironment. To monitor reduction in human exposure WHO and UNEP run a\nmonitoring program for POPs in breastmilk. A steady decline in levels has been\nobserved since 1980 for most countries. In regard to food contamination, the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission,\nwhich is a risk management body comprised of 169 member countries, is\ndeveloping a draft code of practice for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food,\nwhich identifies source-directed measures to reduce their presence in food,\nincluding fish, as well as a position paper, which provides an evaluation of\nthe need for possible regulatory measures, such as limits in food and feed. The results of this new study in salmon and other studies should be used to\nmaintain the focus on reducing the exposure of humans to dioxins and\ndioxin-like PCBs. Specifically, efforts to reduce the level of such substances\nin animals used for human consumption should be actively supported, in\nparticular source-directed measures such as reduction of contamination levels\nin animal feed. FAO and WHO consider fish to be an important component of a nutritious diet,\nand that the risk of consuming contaminated fish must be weighted in view of\nthe beneficial nutritive effects of fish. FAO and WHO plan to develop general\nguidance for such risk-benefit considerations, with the contamination of fish\nas case studies."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-persistent-organic-pollutants-(pops)", "question": "What are toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and similar compounds?", "answer": "Dioxins occur as a complex mixture in the environment and in food. More than\r\n90% of human exposure is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and\r\nshellfish. In order to assess the potential health risk of the whole mixture, the\r\nconcept of toxic equivalence has been applied to this group of structurally and\r\nbiologically related contaminants. TCDD, the most toxic member of the family,\r\nis used as reference compound, and all other dioxins are assigned a toxic\r\npotency relative to TCDD, based on experimental studies. These international\r\nTEFs have been developed for application in risk assessment and management, and\r\nhave been adopted formally for regulatory purposes by a number of countries and\r\nregional bodies, including Canada, the European Union, Japan and the United\r\nStates of America. During the last 15 years, WHO, through the International Programme on\r\nChemical Safety (IPCS), has established and regularly re-evaluated toxic\r\nequivalency factors (TEFs) for dioxins and related compounds through expert\r\nconsultations. WHO-TEF values have been established in 1998 which apply to\r\nhumans, mammals, birds and fish. The last consultation was held in 2005 to\r\nupdate human and mammalian TEFs. Details on the process and outcome can be\r\nfound through the links below."}
{"topic": "/healthy-diet-keys-to-eating-well", "question": "What is a healthy diet for breastfeed babies and young children?", "answer": "From birth to 6 months of age, feed babies exclusively with breast milk (i.e. give them no other food or drink) and feed them on demand (i.e. as often as they want, day and night). At 6 months of age, introduce a variety of safe and nutritious foods to complement breastfeeding, and continue to breastfeed until babies are 2 years of age or beyond. Do not add salt or sugars to foods for babies and young children."}
{"topic": "/healthy-diet-keys-to-eating-well", "question": "Why should babies be breastfed exclusively?", "answer": "On its own, breast milk provides all the nutrients and fluids that babies need for their first 6 months of healthy growth and development. Exclusively breastfed babies have better resistance against common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, respiratory infections and ear infections. In later life, those who were breastfed as infants are less likely to become overweight or obese, or to suffer from noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke."}
{"topic": "/healthy-diet-keys-to-eating-well", "question": "Why is it important to eat a variety of foods?", "answer": "Eating a variety of whole (i.e. unprocessed) and fresh foods every day helps children and adults to obtain the right amounts of essential nutrients. It also helps them to avoid a diet that is high in sugars, fats and salt, which can lead to unhealthy weight gain (i.e. overweight and obesity) and noncommunicable diseases. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is especially important for young children's development. It also helps older people to have healthier and more active lives. WHO recommends that people eat a combination of different foods, including staple foods (e.g. cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice, or starchy tubers or roots such as potato, yam, taro or cassava), legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), vegetables, fruit and foods from animals sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk)."}
{"topic": "/healthy-diet-keys-to-eating-well", "question": "What are the benefits of eating plenty of vegetables and fruit?", "answer": "WHO recommends that people eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruit. For snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruit, rather than foods that are high in sugars, fats or salt. Avoid overcooking vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins. When using canned or dried vegetables and fruit, choose varieties without added salt and sugars Vegetables and fruit are important sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, plant protein and antioxidants. People whose diets are rich in vegetables and fruit have a significantly lower risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer."}
{"topic": "/healthy-diet-keys-to-eating-well", "question": "Is it healthy to eat moderate amounts of fats and oils?", "answer": "Moderate amounts of fats and oils are part of a healthy diet. Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy, and eating too much fat, particularly the wrong kinds of fat, can be harmful to health. For example, people who eat too much saturated fat and trans-fat are at higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Trans-fat may occur naturally in certain meat and milk products, but the industrially produced trans-fat (e.g. partially hydrogenated oils) present in various processed foods is the main source. Use unsaturated vegetable oils (e.g. olive, soy, sunflower or corn oil) rather than animals fats or oils high in saturated fats (e.g. butter, ghee, lard, coconut and palm oil). When possible, choose white meat (e.g. poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fats, rather than red meat. Eat only limited amounts of processed meats because these are high in fat and salt. Try also to opt for low-fat or reduced fat versions of milk and dairy products. Avoid processed, baked and fried foods that contain industrially produced trans-fat."}
{"topic": "/healthy-diet-keys-to-eating-well", "question": "How can I reduce my intake of salt and sugar?", "answer": "People whose diets are high in sodium (including salt) have a greater risk of high blood pressure, which can increase their risk of heart disease and stroke. Similarly, those whose diets are high in sugars have a greater risk of becoming overweight or obese, and an increased risk of tooth decay. People who reduce the amount of sugars in their diet may also reduce their risk of noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and stroke. When cooking and preparing foods, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce and fish sauce). Also, try to avoid foods like snacks that are high in salt and sugars. Limit intake of soft drinks or soda and other drinks that are high in sugars (e.g. fruit juices, cordials and syrups, flavoured milks and yogourt drinks), and choose fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What is ionizing radiation?", "answer": "Ionizing radiation is radiation with enough energy that to remove tightly bound electrons from the orbit of an atom, causing that atom to become charged or ionized. Here we are concerned with only one type of radiation, ionizing radiation, which occurs in two forms: waves or particles. There are several forms of electromagnetic radiation, which differ only in frequency and wavelength: heat waves radio waves infrared light visible light ultraviolet light X rays gamma rays. Longer wavelength, lower frequency waves such as heat and radio have less energy than shorter wavelength, higher frequency waves like X and gamma rays. Not all electromagnetic (EM) radiation is ionizing. Only the high frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes X rays and gamma rays, is ionizing."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What makes radiation wave-like?", "answer": "Most of the more familiar types of electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light and radio waves, exhibit “wave-like” behaviour in their interaction with matter. This energy is carried by oscillating electrical and magnetic fields that travel through space. This form of radiation is measurable though things like reflection and diffraction (ie: how particles pass around and through matter), and the transmission of radio signals that occurs when these waves transfer energy to the electrons in the material through which they are passing. These waves of electromagnetic radiation occur in packets called a photon. Photons are chargeless bundles of energy that travel in a vacuum at the speed of light, which is roughly 300 000 km/sec."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What is the particle form of radiation?", "answer": "Particulate radiation is a form of ionizing radiation. This consists of atomic or subatomic particles (electrons, protons, etc.) that carry kinetic energy, or mass in motion. This comes in several forms, including alpha and beta particles. Alpha particles and beta particles are considered directly ionizing because they carry a charge and can, therefore, interact directly with atomic electrons through coulombic forces (i.e. like charges repel each other; opposite charges attract each other). The neutron is an indirectly ionizing particle because it does not carry an electrical charge. Ionization is caused by charged particles, which are produced during collisions with atomic nuclei. The third type of ionizing radiation includes gamma and X rays, which are electromagnetic, indirectly ionizing radiation. These are indirectly ionizing because they are electrically neutral (as are all electromagnetic radiations) and do not interact with atomic electrons through coulombic forces."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What are isotopes?", "answer": "Atoms in their normal state are electrically neutral because the total negative charge of electrons outside the nucleus equals the total positive charge of the nucleus. Atoms with the same number of protons and different number of neutrons are called isotopes. An isotope may be defined as one, two or more forms of the same element having the same atomic number (Z), differing mass numbers (A) and the same chemical properties. These different forms of an element may be stable or unstable (radioactive). However, since they are forms of the same element, they possess identical chemical and biological properties. The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom. It has one electron orbiting a nucleus on one proton. Any atom with one proton in the nucleus is a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen-2 is called deuterium, hydrogen-3 is called tritium. However, while their chemical properties are identical their nuclear properties are quite different as only tritium is radioactive."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What does activity mean when discussing radioisotopes?", "answer": "The activity of a radioisotope is simply a measure of how many atoms undergo radioactive decay per a unit of time. The International System of Units (SI) unit for measuring the rate of nuclear transformations is the becquerel (Bq). The becquerel is defined as 1 radioactive disintegration per second. The old unit for this is the curie (Ci), in honour of Pierre and Marie Curie, who discovered radium and polonium. The curie is based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226, i.e. 3.7 x 1010 radioactive disintegrations per second."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What is a dose of radiation and how is it measured?", "answer": "Only the energy from ionizing radiation that is imparted to (or absorbed by) the human body can cause harm to health. To understand its biological effects, we must know (or estimate) how much energy is deposited per unit mass of the part of our body with which the radiation is interacting. The international (SI) unit of measure for an absorbed dose is the gray (Gy), which is defined as 1 joule of energy deposited in 1 kilogram of mass. The old unit of measure for this is the rad, which stands for radiation absorbed dose. One gray is equal to 100 rads. The biological effect of this radiation depends not only on the amount of the absorbed dose but also on the intensity of the ionization in the living cells caused by different types of radiation. This is known as the equivalent dose. For example, neutron, proton and alpha radiation can cause 5-20 times more harm than the same amount of the absorbed dose of beta or gamma radiation. The unit of equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv). The old unit of measure is the rem. One sievert is equal to 100 rems."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ionizing-radiation", "question": "What are the sources of radiation exposure?", "answer": "Radiation is permanently present throughout the environment - in the air, water, food, soil and in all living organisms. In fact, a large proportion of the average annual radiation dose received by people results from natural environmental sources. Each person is exposed to an average of 2.4 mSv per year of ionizing radiation from natural sources. In some areas around the world the natural radiation dose may be 5 to 10-times higher for large number of people."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-pesticides", "question": "What are pesticides?", "answer": "Pesticides are chemical compounds that are used to kill pests, including insects, rodents, fungi and unwanted plants (weeds). Over 1000 different pesticides are used around the world. Pesticides are used in public health to kill vectors of disease, such as mosquitoes, and in agriculture to kill pests that damage crops."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-pesticides", "question": "Are pesticides harmful to human health?", "answer": "By their nature, pesticides are potentially toxic to other organisms, including humans, and need to be used safely and disposed of properly. They are among the leading causes of death by self-poisoning, and this burden is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries. Many of the older, cheaper (off-patent) pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and lindane, can remain for years in soil and water. These have adverse effects on larger parts of the ecosystem and can accumulate in the food chain. These chemicals have been banned by countries who signed the 2001 Stockholm Convention."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-pesticides", "question": "Who is at risk?", "answer": "The general population is exposed to low levels of pesticides through food and water, and these are not typically cause for concern. People at higher risk of adverse health effects are those who work directly with pesticides, such as agricultural workers, and those who are in the immediate area when pesticides are applied. People not involved with applying the pesticide should avoid the area during and immediately after its use."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-pesticides", "question": "How can I protect myself when handling or applying pesticides?", "answer": "WHO recommends reducing the use of pesticides when possible. First, determine to what extend the use of pesticides are actually needed. Look for ways to solve the issue with non-chemical pest management where possible. If pesticides are necessary, seek products with the lowest risk to human health and the environment. When using pesticides, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and personal safety. In many cases, personal protective equipment (PPE) is appropriate to avoid direct contact with the pesticide and minimize exposure during handling and application."}
{"topic": "/chemical-safety-pesticides", "question": "Are there international agreements about the use of pesticides?", "answer": "International conventions, such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent, provide a means for countries to protect their populations from exposure to toxic pesticides. Successful implementation of these conventions requires information about the incidence and circumstances of pesticide exposures, and about the health impact of exposure. In many countries such information is still lacking."}
{"topic": "/healthy-ageing-and-functional-ability", "question": "What is healthy ageing?", "answer": "Every person – in every country in the world – should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life. Yet, the environments in which we live can favour health or be harmful to it. Environments are highly influential on our behaviour, our exposure to health risks (for example, air pollution or violence), our access to quality health and social care and the opportunities that ageing brings. Healthy ageing is about creating the environments and opportunities that enable people to be and do what they value throughout their lives. Everybody can experience healthy ageing. Being free of disease or infirmity is not a requirement for healthy ageing, as many older adults have one or more health conditions that, when well controlled, have little influence on their wellbeing."}
{"topic": "/healthy-ageing-and-functional-ability", "question": "What is functional ability and how does it relate to healthy ageing?", "answer": "WHO defines healthy ageing as “the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older age.” Functional ability is about having the capabilities that enable all people to be and do what they have reason to value. This includes a person’s ability to: meet their basic needs; learn, grow and make      decisions; be mobile; build and maintain      relationships; and contribute to society. Functional ability consists of the intrinsic capacity of the individual, relevant environmental characteristics and the interaction between them. Intrinsic capacity comprises all the mental and physical capacities that a person can draw on and includes their ability to walk, think, see, hear and remember. The level of intrinsic capacity is influenced by several factors such as the presence of diseases, injuries and age-related changes. Environments include the home, community and broader society, and all the factors within them such as the built environment, people and their relationships, attitudes and values, health and social policies, the systems that support them and the services that they implement. Being able to live in environments that support and maintain one’s intrinsic capacity and functional ability is key to healthy ageing."}
{"topic": "/healthy-ageing-and-functional-ability", "question": "What are the key considerations for healthy ageing?", "answer": "Diversity: There is no typical older person. Some 80-year-olds have levels of physical and mental capacity that compare favourably with 30-year-olds. Others of the same age may require extensive care and support for basic activities like dressing and eating. Policy should be framed to improve the functional ability of all older people, whether they are robust, care dependent or in between. Inequity: A large proportion (approximately 75%) of the diversity in capacity and circumstance observed in older age is the result of the cumulative impact of advantage and disadvantage across people’s lives. Importantly, the relationships we have with our environments are shaped by factors such as the family we were born into, our sex, ethnicity, level of education and financial resources."}
{"topic": "/healthy-ageing-and-functional-ability", "question": "How does healthy ageing differ from active ageing?", "answer": "Healthy ageing is the focus\r\nof WHO’s work on ageing between 2015 – 2030. Healthy\r\nageing replaces the World Health Organization’s previous focus on active ageing, a policy framework\r\ndeveloped in 2002. Healthy ageing,\r\nlike active ageing, emphasizes the need for action across multiple sectors and\r\nenabling older people to remain a resource to their families, communities and\r\neconomies."}
{"topic": "/climate-change-land-degradation-and-desertification", "question": "What is land degradation?", "answer": "Land degradation is caused by multiple forces, including extreme weather conditions, particularly drought. It is also caused by human activities that pollute or degrade the quality of soils and land utility. It negatively affects food production, livelihoods, and the production and provision of other ecosystem goods and services. Desertification is a form of land degradation by which fertile land becomes desert."}
{"topic": "/climate-change-land-degradation-and-desertification", "question": "What are the threats to land integrity?", "answer": "Land degradation has accelerated during the 20 th and 21 st centuries due to increasing and combined pressures of agricultural and livestock production (over-cultivation, overgrazing, forest conversion), urbanization, deforestation and extreme weather events such as droughts and coastal surges, which salinate land."}
{"topic": "/climate-change-land-degradation-and-desertification", "question": "What does land degradation mean for the planet?", "answer": "These social and environmental processes are stressing the world's arable lands and pastures essential for the provision of food and water and quality air. Land degradation and desertification can affect human health through complex pathways. As land is degraded and deserts expand in some places, food production is reduced, water sources dry up and populations are pressured to move to more hospitable areas."}
{"topic": "/climate-change-land-degradation-and-desertification", "question": "What effect does desertification on human health?", "answer": "The potential impacts of desertification on health include: higher threats of      malnutrition from reduced food and water supplies; more water- and food-borne      diseases that result from poor hygiene and a lack of clean water; respiratory diseases caused      by atmospheric dust from wind erosion and other air pollutants; the spread of infectious      diseases as populations migrate."}
{"topic": "/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder", "question": "What is gaming disorder?", "answer": "Gaming disorder is defined in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as a pattern of gaming behavior (“digital-gaming” or “video-gaming”) characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months."}
{"topic": "/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder", "question": "What is the International Classification of Diseases?", "answer": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the basis for identification of health trends and statistics globally and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions and by researchers to categorize conditions. The inclusion of a disorder in ICD is a consideration which countries take into account when planning public health strategies and monitoring trends of disorders. WHO released the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in mid-2018."}
{"topic": "/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder", "question": "Why is gaming disorder being included in ICD-11?", "answer": "A decision on inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 is based on reviews of available evidence and reflects a consensus of experts from different disciplines and geographical regions that were involved in the process of technical consultations undertaken by WHO in the process of ICD-11 development. The inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 follows the development of treatment programmes for people with health conditions identical to those characteristic of gaming disorder in many parts of the world,  and will result in the increased attention of health professionals to the risks of development of this disorder and, accordingly, to relevant prevention and treatment measures."}
{"topic": "/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder", "question": "Should all people who engage in gaming be concerned about developing gaming disorder?", "answer": "Studies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital- or video-gaming activities. However, people who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities,  particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "What is adolescence?", "answer": "Adolescence is a period of life with specific health and developmental needs and rights. It is also a time to develop knowledge and skills, learn to manage emotions and relationships, and acquire attributes and abilities that will be important for enjoying the adolescent years and assuming adult roles. All societies recognize that there is a difference between being a child and becoming an adult. How this transition from childhood to adulthood is defined and recognized differs between cultures and over time. In the past it has often been relatively rapid, and in some societies it still is. In many countries, however, this is changing."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "Is adolescence defined by specific ages?", "answer": "Age is a convenient way to define adolescence, but it is only one characteristic that delineates this period of development. Age is often more appropriate for assessing and comparing biological changes (e.g. puberty), which are fairly universal, than the social transitions, which vary more with the socio-cultural environment."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "What physical changes occur in adolescence?", "answer": "Adolescence is one of the most rapid phases of human development. Although the order of many of the changes appears to be universal, their timing and the speed of change vary among and even within individuals. Both the characteristics of an individual (e.g. sex) and external factors (e.g. inadequate nutrition, an abusive environment) influence these changes."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "Are there neurological changes during adolescence?", "answer": "Important neuronal developments also take place during the adolescent years. These developments are linked to hormonal changes but are not always dependent on them. Developments occur in regions of the brain, such as the limbic system, that are responsible for pleasure seeking and reward processing, emotional responses and sleep regulation. At the same time, changes occur place in the pre-frontal cortex, the area responsible for what are called executive functions: decision-making, organization, impulse control and planning for the future. The changes in the pre-frontal cortex occur later in adolescence than the limbic system changes."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "How about psychological and social changes?", "answer": "Linked to the hormonal and neurodevelopmental changes of adolescence are psychosocial and emotional changes and increasing cognitive and intellectual capacities. Over the course of the second decade, adolescents develop stronger reasoning skills, logical and moral thinking, and become more capable of abstract thinking and making rational judgements. Changes in the adolescent’s environment both affect and are affected by the internal changes of adolescence. These external influences, which differ among cultures and societies, include social values and norms and the changing roles, responsibilities, relationships and expectations of this period of life."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "How does adolescence affect one’s health and behaviour?", "answer": "In many ways adolescent development drives the changes in the disease burden between childhood to adulthood – for example, the increase with age in sexual and reproductive health problems, mental illness and injuries. The appearance of certain health problems in adolescence, including substance use disorders, mental disorders and injuries, likely reflects both the biological changes of puberty and the social context in which young people are growing up. Other conditions, such as the increased incidence of certain infectious diseases, for example, schistosomiasis, may simply result from the daily activities of adolescents during this period of their lives. Many of the health-related behaviours that arise during adolescence have implications for both present and future health and development. For example, alcohol use and obesity in early adolescence not only compromise adolescent development, but they also predict health-compromising alcohol use and obesity in later life, with serious implications for public health."}
{"topic": "/adolescent-health-and-development", "question": "How should adolescence be considered in health policies and programmes?", "answer": "The changes that take place during adolescence suggest nine observations with implications for health policies and programmes: adolescents need explicit attention; adolescents are not all the same, some adolescents are particularly vulnerable, adolescent development has implications for adolescent health; adolescent development has health implications throughout life; the changes during adolescence affect how adolescents think and act; adolescents need to understand the processes taking place during adolescence; to contribute positively, adults need to understand the processes taking place during adolescence; and public health and human rights converge around concepts of adolescent development."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "What is the EUL?", "answer": "The WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a procedure for assessing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics and in vitro diagnostics during public health emergencies with the ultimate goal of expediting the availability of these products to people who need them."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "When can the EUL be used?", "answer": "The EUL is used during public health emergencies. When products are not licensed yet (still in development), WHO will assess the quality, safety and efficacy (or performance) data generated during development and conduct a risk-benefit assessment to decide if they can be used outside clinical trials."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "Do the eligibility criteria for EUL apply to COVID-19 products?", "answer": "Yes, all eligibility criteria are applicable. These are: the disease may cause an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic; there are no products available capable of eradicating or preventing the disease; products are manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practices; and the applicant undertakes to complete the development of the product and apply for prequalification once it is licensed."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "Does the EUL provide for products developed after a public health emergency has been declared?", "answer": "Yes. The procedure provides for a situation where the vaccine can be assessed after the public health emergency of international concern/pandemic has been declared. In this particular instance, WHO may select a group of experts from the pre-established roster to accelerate the assessment and issue a recommendation within a short timeline."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "How soon can a vaccine against Covid-19 be assessed under the EUL?", "answer": "The EUL provides an assessment pathway for investigational products. The development of vaccines against Covid-19 did not start until after the outbreak, as the disease is caused by a novel virus. An unprecedented global effort has seen multiple vaccine candidates move into clinical trials (human studies). Early discussions between vaccine developers and WHO PQ are strongly encouraged. For an investigational vaccine to be considered fit for use in a public health emergency, data should demonstrate that there is a benefit in the target population that outweighs the risk of its use."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "Does WHO need to evaluate a product that has already been approved by a WHO listed authority for use during public health emergencies ?", "answer": "When a product submitted for EUL has been assessed through other emergency mechanisms by a WHO Listed authority, WHO does not intend to duplicate work. However, WHO will assess the suitability of products from a global public health perspective and, on a case-by-case basis, may assess aspects of the quality, safety, efficacy and performance of the products ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "Do clinical trials continue after a product has been assessed and listed under the EUL procedure?", "answer": "Yes. The fact that the vaccines are granted a recommendation to be used in a public health emergency whilst they are still under development is only a temporary measure to ensure availability of preventive tools that present a favorable benefit-risk ratio in the context of the public health emergency (PHE). However, manufacturers commit to continue with the development and if completed successfully, will submit the product for registration and apply for prequalification. Manufacturers are expected to provide detailed guidance and a risk management plan."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "Will the evaluation of Covid-19 vaccines continue after the PHE is no longer in effect?", "answer": "Once the PHE is no longer in effect, those products assessed during the pandemic are expected to continue their development. Therefore, new quality, safety and efficacy data should be made available for assessment and the risk benefit assessment will be updated. If such products are registered, they will be eligible for prequalification and not for EUL assessment."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "Does the EUL procedure ensure rapid availability?", "answer": "The EUL allows products in development (not licensed) to be assessed by WHO for listing. WHO review is expedited to ensure timely evaluation. The manufacturer’s diligence in addressing WHO’s questions influences the assessment timelines as well. The procurement and distribution processes that have an impact on the timeline for availability of listed products is beyond the scope of the EUL procedure."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-use-of-emergency-use-listing-procedure-forvaccines-against-covid-19", "question": "How will WHO interact with National Regulatory Authorities?", "answer": "WHO actively promotes the principles of reliance for interactions with NRAs based on facilitated regulatory pathways, as was done for Ebola virus disease vaccine. Virtual meetings will be organized with the NRAs from target countries for vaccine deployment. However, identifying the target countries may be complex due to the changing Covid-19 situation. In addition, WHO is mapping the regulatory requirements of countries for emergency use of vaccines during a PHE. Further, subject matter experts from NRAs, and regulatory networks, will be involved in the EUL assessment process of candidate vaccines."}
{"topic": "/abortion-safety", "question": "Which health care workers can provide medical abortion services?", "answer": "Abortions are safe when they are carried out with a method that is recommended by WHO and that is appropriate to the pregnancy duration, and when the person carrying out the abortion has the necessary skills. In addition to non-specialist and specialist doctors, a wide range of health worker cadres – such as auxiliary nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, nurses, midwives, associate/ advanced associate clinicians, pharmacists and doctors of complementary\n    medicine – can provide various aspects of medical abortion services."}
{"topic": "/abortion-safety", "question": "Can medical abortion be self-managed by the client herself?", "answer": "When using the combination mifepristone and misoprostol regimen, the medical abortion process can be self-managed for pregnancies up to 12 weeks of gestation, including the ability to take the medications at home, without direct supervision of a health-care\n    provider."}
{"topic": "/abortion-safety", "question": "Is an ultrasound routinely required for the provision of abortion?", "answer": "Ultrasound scanning is not routinely required for the provision of abortion. A physical examination to assess uterine size, determine the last menstrual period and identify symptoms of pregnancy are usually adequate."}
{"topic": "/abortion-safety", "question": "Can unsafe abortions be prevented?", "answer": "Unsafe abortions can be prevented through: Comprehensive sexuality education Prevention of unintended pregnancy through use of effective contraception, including emergency contraception Provision of legal safe abortion. A safe abortion is an abortion carried out with a method that is recommended by WHO and that is appropriate to the pregnancy duration; and for which the person carrying out the abortion has the necessary skills."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "Are children at lower risk of COVID-19 than adults?", "answer": "So far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years represent about 8.5% of reported cases, with relatively few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical conditions have been suggested as a risk factor for severe disease and intensive care admission in children. Further studies are underway to assess the risk of infection in children and to better understand transmission in this age group."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "What is the role of children in transmission?", "answer": "The role of children in transmission is not yet fully understood. To date, few outbreaks involving children or schools have been reported. However, the small number of outbreaks reported among teaching or associated staff to date suggests that spread\r\n    of COVID-19 within educational settings may be limited. As children generally have milder illness and fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data from studies suggest that infection rates among teenagers may be higher than in younger children. Considering that many countries are starting to slowly lift restrictions on activities, the longer-term effects of keeping schools open on community transmission are yet to be evaluated. Some modelling studies suggest that school re-opening might have\r\n    a small effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood. Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. WHO is collaborating with scientists around the world\r\n    to develop protocols that countries can use to study COVID-19 transmission in educational institutions.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "Should children with underlying health conditions (asthma, diabetes, obesity) return to school?", "answer": "Whether a child should go to school depends on their health condition, the current transmission of COVID-19 within their community, and the protective measures the school and community have in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. While current evidence suggests that the risk of severe disease for children is lower overall than for adults, special precautions can be taken to minimize the risk of infection among children, and the benefits of returning to school should also be considered. Current evidence suggests that people with underlying conditions such as chronic respiratory illness including asthma (moderate-to-severe), obesity, diabetes or cancer, are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death than people without other health conditions. This also appears to be the case for children, but more information is still needed."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "Should teachers and other staff with underlying health conditions return to school?", "answer": "Adults 60 years and older and people with underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe disease and death. The decision to return to a teaching environment depends on the individual and should include consideration of local disease trends, as well as the measures being put in place in schools to prevent further spread."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "What is the incubation period for children?", "answer": "The incubation period for children is the same as in adults. The time between exposure to COVID-19 and when symptoms start is commonly around 5 to 6 days, and ranges from 1 to 14 days."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "What should be considered when deciding whether to re-open schools or keep them open?", "answer": "Deciding to close, partially close or reopen schools should be guided by a risk-based approach, to maximize the educational, well-being and health benefit for students, teachers, staff, and the wider community, and help prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19 in the community. Several elements should be assessed in deciding to re-open schools or keep them open: The epidemiology of COVID-19 at the local level: This may vary from one place to another within a country Benefits and risks: what are the likely benefits and risks to children and staff of open schools? Including consideration of: Transmission intensity in the area where the school operates: No cases, sporadic transmission; clusters transmission or community transmission Overall impact of school closures on education, general health and wellbeing; and on vulnerable and marginalized populations (e.g. girls, displaced or disabled) Effectiveness of remote learning strategies Detection and response: Are the local health authorities able to act quickly? The capacity of schools/educational institutions to operate safely Collaboration and coordination: Is the school collaborating with local public health authorities? The range of other public health measures being implemented outside school"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "What benefits would school re-opening provide?", "answer": "School closures have clear negative impacts on child health, education and development, family income and the overall economy. The decision to reopen schools should include consideration of the following benefits: Allowing students to complete their studies and continue to the next level Essential services, access to nutrition, child welfare, such as preventing violence against children Social and psychological well-being Access to reliable information on how to keep themselves and others safe Reducing the risk of non-return to school Benefit to society, such as allowing parents to work"}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "What are the prevention and control measures to be prepared and put in place in schools?", "answer": "There are several actions and requirements that should be reviewed and put in place to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in schools and into the community; and to ensure the safety of children and school staff while at school. Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions. WHO recommends the following: Community-level measures: Carry out early detection, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts; investigate clusters; ensure physical distancing, hand and hygiene practices and age-appropriate mask use; shield vulnerable groups. Community-led initiatives such as addressing misleading rumors also play an important role in reducing the risk of infection. Policy, practice and infrastructure : Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure, are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk. Behavioral aspects : Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks. Safety and security : School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off. Hygiene and daily practices at the school and classroom level : Physical distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals including spacing of desks, frequent hand and respiratory hygiene, age-appropriate mask use, ventilation and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touches surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks. Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff : Schools should enforce the policy of “staying home if unwell”, waive the requirement for a doctor’s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival. Protection of individuals at high-risk: Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and se of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Communication with parents and students : Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support. Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes : Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support. Physical distancing outside classrooms : Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible. Physical distancing inside classrooms: In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms. In areas with cluster-transmission of COVID-19, a risk-based approach should be taken when deciding whether to keep a distance of at least 1 metre between students. Staff should always keep at least 1 metre apart from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical. In areas with sporadic cases/no cases of COVID-19, children under the age of 12 should not be required to keep physical distance at all times. Where feasible, children aged 12 and over should keep at least 1 metre apart from each other.  Staff should always keep at least 1 metre from each other and from students and should wear a mask in situations where 1-metre distance is not practical. Remote learning : Where children cannot attend classes in person, support should be given to ensure students have continued access to educational materials and technologies (internet, texting radio, radio, or television), (e.g. delivering assignments or broadcasting lessons). Shutting down educational facilities   should only be considered when no alternatives are available."}

Promote and put in place respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing measures and use of masks in transportation such as school buses, in accordance with local policy. Provide tips for how to safely commute to and from school, including for public transportation. Organize only one child per seat and ensure physical distancing of at least 1 metre between passengers in school buses, if possible. This may require more school buses per school. If possible and safe, keep the windows of the buses, vans, and other vehicles open."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "Does WHO recommend staff and children to wear masks at school? And if yes, what type of masks?", "answer": "In countries or areas where there is intense community transmission of COVID-19 and in settings where physical distancing cannot be achieved, the following criteria for use of masks in schools are recommended: 1. Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. 2. For children between six and 11 years of age, a risk-based approach should be applied to the decision to use a mask, considering: intensity of transmission in the area where the child is and evidence on the risk of infection and transmission in this age group. beliefs, customs and behaviours. the child’s capacity to comply with the correct use of masks and availability of adult supervision. potential impact of mask wearing on learning and development. additional considerations such as sport activities or for children with disabilities or underlying diseases. 3. Children and adolescents 12 years or older should follow the national mask guidelines for adults. 4. Teacher and support staff may be required to wear masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others or there is widespread transmission in the area. Types of mask: Fabric masks are recommended to prevent onward transmission in the general population in public areas, particularly where distancing is not possible, and in areas of community transmission. This could include the school grounds in some situations.\r\n    Masks may help to protect others, because wearers may be infected before symptoms of illness appear. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering should be in line with national or local guidelines. Where\r\n    used, masks should be worn, cared for and disposed of properly. The use of masks by children and adolescents in schools should only be considered as one part of a strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "Are there any specific recommendations on school ventilation and air conditioning use?", "answer": "Yes, ensure adequate ventilation and increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible. Clean, natural ventilation (i.e., opening windows) should be used inside buildings where possible, without re-circulating the air. If heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are used they should be regularly inspected, maintained and cleaned. Rigorous standards for installation, maintenance and filtration are essential to make sure they are effective and safe. Consider running the systems at maximum outside airflow for two hours before and after times when the building is occupied, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-schools", "question": "What should be monitored after re-opening of school?", "answer": "The following should be monitored: effectiveness of symptoms-reporting, monitoring, rapid testing and tracing of suspected cases the effects of policies and measures on educational objectives and learning outcomes the effects of policies and measures on health and well-being of children, siblings, staff, parents and other family members the trend in school dropouts after lifting the restrictions the number of cases in children and staff in the school, and frequency of school-based outbreaks in the local administrative area and the country.

The package will guide countries to take strategic and targeted action, and drive investments, by consolidating the best technical practices to strengthen health information systems using universally accepted standards and tools."}
{"topic": "/score-technical-package", "question": "What is the SCORE global report on health data systems and capacity, 2020?", "answer": "The SCORE global report on health data systems & capacity, 2020, launched on 1 February 2021, is a key component of the SCORE Technical Package. The report places countries at the centre to address gaps and inequalities in health information systems. It presents assessment results from 133 country health information systems covering 87% of the global population and highlights the need for greater investment in key areas.  Additional countries are anticipated to be included in future releases . The report represents the results of country health information system assessments conducted by WHO between 2018 and 2020 using the WHO SCORE Assessment Instrument. This is a global monitoring tool that can be used as a basis for countries to collect data on their health information systems. The report provides concrete recommendations and guidance for countries to invest in health information system priority areas that can achieve greatest impact to improve heath data collection, quality control, synthesis, analysis and the use of health data."}
{"topic": "/score-technical-package", "question": "How many countries were covered by the report?", "answer": "The SCORE global report required great commitment and efforts to collect and validate the large amount of data across a wide spectrum. 133 countries made the cut-off point and were included in this first report; we look forward to including the more countries in future assessments."}
{"topic": "/score-technical-package", "question": "What are the key findings of the SCORE global report?", "answer": "The SCORE global report shows key health information system areas that have benefited from efforts made over time, but also highlights critical areas in need of strengthening that require focused national and international collaboration. Globally, 68% of countries have well-developed and sustainable capacity for public health threat surveillance . Yet this varies between regions and income groups. Most countries maintain a census or population registry and 86% conducted a census in the last 10 years, providing important baseline data for many health estimates. However, only half of the countries provided disaggregated population projections, limiting the use of these data. High-quality data are not routinely collected in sufficient detail to allow effective assessment of health trends and health inequalities at various levels. The divide between high and low-income countries is reflected in many key areas, including the counting of births, deaths and causes of death. Nearly 40% (4 in 10) of the world’s deaths remain unregistered. The current COVID-19 pandemic has brought this into focus, whereby countries face serious challenges in both measuring the full burden of the virus as well as accurately counting deaths. Optimizing health service data is critical to ensure equitable, quality services for all. Yet nearly 50% of countries have limited or less capacity for systematic monitoring of quality of care. The report illustrates the high availability of data on immunization, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS although less coverage of mental health and cancer. For instance, only 48% of countries report national facility data on severe mental health disorders. Data coverage is usually better at national and subnational levels, but less so when disaggregated by sex and age. Approximately 60% of 133 countries have a well-developed or sustainable system for conducting analytical reviews of progress and performance of their health sector to make informed decisions, representing more than 75% of the world population. An environment that enables data use for policy and action is critical for ensuring the effective use of health data. Almost 60% of countries have good capacity for using data and evidence to drive policy and planning, but only 42% of countries have good capacity for data access and sharing; 32% of the countries have good capacity for a national digital health strategy based on recommended standards. In summary, while some countries have achieved a sustainable capacity in key areas, no country has a fully mature health information system capable of meeting its evolving needs."}
{"topic": "/score-technical-package", "question": "What are the recommendations of the SCORE global report?", "answer": "All countries to conduct post-enumeration surveys after each census. Countries should strengthen their death registration systems. Improve health data disaggregation to identify health gaps among underprivileged groups and address inequalities. Investments should be made across all major health programmes to strengthen countries’ general health data systems, rather than specific programmes. Strong data governance regulations are also needed to improve data access and sharing, and to translate data into policies."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-at-hotels-and-accommodation-establishments", "question": "What precautions should everyone take in a hotel or other accommodation establishment?", "answer": "Everyone should follow basic precautions: Wash all parts of your hands frequently (at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, and at least 40 seconds with soap and water), including after exchanging objects such as money or credit cards. Look for hand sanitizer stations and use them before going into dining halls, restaurants or bars. Cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and throw away the tissue in a closed bin. Maintain at least a 1 metre distance from staff and other guests. This includes avoiding hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you can’t guarantee the distance, wear a mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-at-hotels-and-accommodation-establishments", "question": "Are there precautions to take while eating in a restaurant?", "answer": "There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted by food, including fresh fruits and vegetables. The virus can be killed while cooking food at temperatures of at least 70°C. Food buffets are not recommended because of the risk of close physical contact with others, shared serving implements and multiple people touching the surfaces on the buffet. Indoor dining spaces should have a maximum of 4 people in 10 square metres. The distance from the back of one chair to the back of another chair should be at least 1 metre apart for both indoor and outdoor dining, and guests that face each other should also be at this distance. Guests should be reminded when entering and leaving the area to clean their hands. When the physical distance of at least 1 metre cannot be guaranteed, masks are recommended to be worn by staff and guests. More on masks, including who should wear what kind and when, is available here ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-at-hotels-and-accommodation-establishments", "question": "Is it safe to use fans or air conditioning in an accommodation?", "answer": "Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading. Recirculated air from split air conditioning units, fan coils or any system that runs with a recirculation mode should be avoided where possible, unless in a single occupancy room with no one else present. If recirculation is unavoidable, increase outdoor air exchange by opening windows, if possible and safe to do so, and minimize air blowing from one person directly at another. Floor or ceiling fans can provide ventilation when the people occupying the room are from the same household, but are not recommended when travelers from different households are together."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-at-hotels-and-accommodation-establishments", "question": "Can you get the virus from people who were in the room previous to you?", "answer": "Hotels and other accommodations should have procedures for cleaning, disinfecting and ventilating the room properly between every guest’s stay. These processes allow the accommodations to be used immediately afterward. If these procedures are followed, there is no need to leave the room empty between guests."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-at-hotels-and-accommodation-establishments", "question": "What should travellers do if they get sick while at an accommodation facility?", "answer": "If a guest develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should notify the facility manager and seek medical advice by contacting local health authorities. The guest should isolate from others, including fellow travellers. If the guest cannot be isolated or staff need to enter the room, the ill person should put on a medical mask, and people nearby should also wear a mask.  If the medical mask cannot be tolerated by the ill person, then he or she should cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or use tissues to cover the mouth, and discard the tissue immediately into a closed waste bag."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-working-in-hotels", "question": "What can staff do to stay safe while working at a hotel or other accommodation establishment?", "answer": "Everyone should follow basic precautions: Wash all parts of your hands frequently (at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, and at least 40 seconds with soap and water), including after exchanging objects such as money or credit cards with guests. Cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue and throw away the tissue in a closed bin. Maintain at least a 1 metre distance from other staff and guests. This includes avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you can’t guarantee the distance, wear a fabric mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks. Staying behind plexiglass boards at reception and concierge desks can prevent droplet transmission. Teleworking may be a possibility for some jobs, which can help reduce physical contact with others."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-working-in-hotels", "question": "Should staff wear a mask while working?", "answer": "In areas where the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating, staff aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. Staff under the age of 60 and who are in general good health can wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1 metre distance from others. This is particularly important for staff who are in close contact or potential close contact with others. Everyone should follow local policies and regulations."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-working-in-hotels", "question": "What should staff do if a guest becomes sick at an accommodation establishment?", "answer": "If a guest at the accommodation develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, staff at the accommodation establishment should contact the local health authority and follow their instructions. The sick person should be isolated in a room, alone, or at least 1 metre away from others, according to local health authorities’ instructions. No visitors should be permitted to enter the room occupied by the affected guest. Staff should also move people traveling with the sick person to a different room, if possible. It is usually the relevant public health authority, not the management of the hotel and accommodation establishment, which has the authority to demand sick guests to temporarily remain in their room or to prevent them from receiving visits from other guests. National law will guide the rights of the guests to refuse or not the recommended measures. Staff entering the room of an ill person should maintain at least a 1 metre distance from the ill person, and request that the ill person put on a medical mask. If staff need to assist an ill guest within a 1 metre distance, they should clean their hands before putting on appropriate personal protective equipment (medical mask and eye protection, gloves and isolation gown), and clean their hands after providing assistance. Training should be provided on how to avoid contaminating themselves."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-working-in-hotels", "question": "What should staff do if they have symptoms?", "answer": "If staff develop COVID-19 symptoms while at work, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should immediately stop working, put on a medical mask and isolate in a suitable room while medical services are notified. Disposable tissues and an appropriate waste bin with a lid should be available in the designated isolation area while waiting for medical assessment or transfer to an assessment facility. If staff develop symptoms while at home, they should stay at home and seek medical attention, following instructions from a health worker that will include a period of time for self-isolation away from others, including family members, according to local guidance.  The staff member should inform the management accordingly."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "How many malaria-affected countries have reported cases of COVID-19?", "answer": "Malaria-endemic countries in all WHO have regions have reported cases of COVID-19. In the WHO African Region, which carries more than 90% of the global malaria burden, there have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. The latest situation reports on the COVID-19 pandemic are available on the WHO website."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "Should core malaria vector control interventions be maintained in view of the rapid global spread of COVID-19?", "answer": "As of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible. Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response includes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities. The document is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "Should WHO-recommended preventive therapies be maintained in sub-Saharan Africa?", "answer": "Yes, delivery of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) should be maintained provided that best practices for protecting health workers – and other front-line workers – from COVID-19 are followed. Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response , developed by WHO and partners , includes guidance on how to deliver preventive therapies for pregnant women and young children in ways that protect health workers and communities against potential COVID-19 transmission."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment?", "answer": "WHO guidance remains the same. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease. As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?", "answer": "In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible. Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "What are the key considerations for countries that are working to eliminate malaria or prevent re-establishment of transmission?", "answer": "All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas?", "answer": "Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries. A modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April , found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic. In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "Have there been disruptions in the global supply of key malaria-related commodities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "Yes. Since the early days of the pandemic, there have been reports of disruptions in the supply chains of essential malaria commodities – such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medicines – resulting from lockdowns and from a suspension of the importation and exportation of goods in response to COVID-19. WHO and partners are working together to ensure the availability of key malaria control tools, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease, and that efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 do not compromise access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?", "answer": "WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including the more than 80 studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. To date, 3 large randomized controlled trials, including the WHO Solidarity trial, have failed to show that the use of hydroxychloroquine among hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 can prevent death or disease progression. Additionally, 3 trials of patients with mild or moderate disease failed to show a significant benefit in prevention of respiratory failure through the use of hydroxychloroquine. Thus, there is now growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This evidence will inform the next update of WHO guidance on therapeutics. Studies on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent individuals, particularly those at high risk such as health care workers, from contracting COVID-19 are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to assess the protective efficacy of either of these medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 infection or disease. WHO cautions physicians against administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 outside the context of a clinical trial. Individuals are also advised against self-medicating with these drugs. For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "What is WHO’s position on the use of Artemisia plant material for the prevention or treatment of malaria and/or COVID-19?", "answer": "The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua . There have been reports that products or extracts (e.g. herbal teas or tablets) made from Artemisia plant material may have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. However, available in vitro data suggests that purified artemisinin compounds or A. annua plant product or extracts do not have an appreciable effect against COVID-19 at concentrations that could be safely achieved in humans. As such, current evidence does not support the use of artemisinins or A. annua products or extracts as an antiviral for COVID-19. WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement , there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from Artemisia -based plant material."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-malaria-and-covid-19", "question": "What is WHO doing to support malaria-affected countries in the context of COVID-19?", "answer": "The WHO Global Malaria Programme is leading a cross-partner effort to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus in malaria-affected countries and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response. The work is being carried out in close collaboration with colleagues based at WHO headquarters, regional offices and country level. In March 2020, before the pandemic had secured a strong footing in Africa, WHO sounded an urgent call for maintaining core malaria prevention and treatment services while protecting health workers and communities against COVID-19 transmission. The findings of a modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published in April, reinforced the WHO call for continuity of malaria services during then pandemic. In collaboration with partners, WHO developed technical guidance for countries on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-for-consumers", "question": "Can I get COVID-19 from food?", "answer": "There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food or food packaging.

An assessment about home care for each patient should be based on the following factors: Clinical evaluation of the patient. Evaluation of the patient’s home setting according to infection prevention and control (IPC) criteria (e.g., ability to carry out hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental cleaning, adequate ventilation, limitations on movement around or from the house). Presence of vulnerable people at higher risk of COVID-19 in the home. Ability of a caregiver to provide care and closely monitor the evolution of the patient’s health, at least once per day, and to recognize signs and symptoms of any worsening of the health status. Availability of trained health workers to support the patient and caregiver (home-based, phone, telemedicine, trained community workers or outreach teams). If adequate isolation from others in the home and infection prevention control measures cannot be ensured, then isolation in designated community facilities or a health facility may need to be arranged, with consent from the patient and in agreement with the caregiver and household members. It is important to note that in areas with other endemic infections that cause fever, such as influenza, malaria, dengue, etc., febrile patients should seek medical care, be tested and treated for those endemic infections per routine protocols, irrespective of the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms. Home care does not replace healthcare by professionals. Those patients who receive homecare should be regularly monitored by health workers."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-health-workers-and-administrators", "question": "What additional factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the home setting to determine if it is safe for patients and families to remain at home?", "answer": "There are a number of environmental and social factors to consider for patients to safely remain at home with their families or household members. An overall needs assessment of the patient and family that includes the availability of trained health workers\r\n    for support should be conducted.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-health-workers-and-administrators", "question": "What precautions should health workers take when providing care to patients in home settings?", "answer": "Health workers should take the following precautions: Perform a risk assessment to select the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown when caring for the patient. Implement infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene. Ensure the room where the patient is cared for is well ventilated, opening windows if necessary. Provide instructions to caregivers and household members on cleaning and disinfection in the home, and on management of waste, laundry and utensils related to the patient. Request the patient to wear a medical mask when providing care or within a 1-metre distance. Request limiting the number of household members during visits and maintaining at least a 1-metre distance. Remove PPE and discard what is disposable, then perform hand hygiene before leaving the home. Make sure that the waste generated from providing care to the patient be placed in strong bags or safety boxes as appropriate, closed completely, disposed as infectious waste and removed from the home."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-home-care-for-health-workers-and-administrators", "question": "Can children be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?", "answer": "Children should be kept together with their parents or caregivers wherever possible. Children with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they are not obese, do not smoke, and do not have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or immunosuppression. Caregivers of children with COVID-19 should monitor for signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration requiring urgent re-evaluation. These include difficulty breathing/fast or shallow breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed), blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to awaken/not interacting when awake, inability to drink or keep down any liquids. If caregivers are suspected or have confirmed COVID-19 infection, medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account due to the negative and possible long-term consequences of even a short period of family separation. Community protection focal points and caseworkers should help families plan–in advance–agreements for the care of children in case the caregiver becomes ill.  Children living with primary caregivers who are elderly, disabled or have underlying health conditions should be prioritized."}
{"topic": "/emergency-health-kits", "question": "What sort of supplies are in a standard emergency health kit?", "answer": "WHO has standardized medicines and medical supplies needed in emergencies to allow swift, efficient and effective response to the need for medicines and medical supplies. This has led to the supply of standard, pre-packed kits that can be kept in readiness to meet priority health needs in emergency. WHO uses standardized medical kits of different profiles. They are primarily intended for affected or displaced populations without medical facilities. They can also be used for initial supply of primary health care facilities where the normal system of provision has broken down. The most common emergency health kits are: Trauma Emergency and Surgery Kit (TESK 2019) Replaces the trauma A&B, SSK and Anaesthetic kit. To guide you during the transition phase to the TESK 2019, please read the technicalnote available on the WHO kit website: https://www.who.int/emergencies/supplies/trauma-emergency-surgery-kit-who-tesk-2019 Target and use: The TESK 2019 kit aims at providing drugs and health supplies meeting the needs of 50 patients requiring surgical care in emergency situations, (average of 2 operations per patient = 100 interventions).

{"topic": "/preventing-protecting-against-attacks", "question": "What work is WHO doing for the prevention of attacks on health care?", "answer": "WHO has put considerable effort in documenting the problem to inform the global response to attacks on health care. The Surveillance System for Attack on Health Care (SSA) is the primary tool collecting and sharing data about incidents of attacks in emergency countries. Through the SSA, WHO has established the first body of verified and reliable evidence, which can be used to generate analyses and reports to better understand attacks on health care. In addition, WHO advocates at the global and local levels to promote behaviour change. The global level strategy includes the organization of high-level events about attacks on health care, collaborations with partners involved in this field and social media campaigns. At the local level, WHO raises awareness about the importance of addressing attacks, distributes and shares information to support the response, negotiates for better access to health and collaborates with partners who have activities at the operational level. Finally, WHO has invested in the development of a body of research looking at the impact of attacks on health care and the documentation of good practices for prevention and protection measures. These aim to support health care providers in designing effective responses to attacks on health care."}
{"topic": "/preventing-protecting-against-attacks", "question": "What work is WHO doing to understand the consequences of attacks on health care?", "answer": "As the full extent of the impact of attacks on health care is not yet known, WHO is investing in researches on the different aspects of attacks as well as their short, mid and long term consequences. Through its research, WHO aims to provide more information about the impact of attacks on health care to the health of the affected populations as well as health service delivery, availability and accessibility."}
{"topic": "/preventing-protecting-against-attacks", "question": "How can attacks on health care be addressed?", "answer": "Addressing attacks on health care is a complex and challenging task. During emergencies, attacks come in so many shapes and forms that solutions to address them must be locally adapted in order to be effective. When addressing attacks on health care, it is important to keep in mind that incidents of attacks should not be viewed as isolated events, but as one piece of a larger problem. By conducting thorough context analyses, health care providers can adapt their protective measures to address the challenges posed by the local political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical contexts in which they operate. For this reason, WHO is conducting research on drivers of violence in various contexts and will provide a framework to conduct context analyses in emergency countries. Furthermore, WHO documents good practices undertaken by various actors to prevent attacks and mitigate their impact in emergency countries. Although each “practice”\r\n    is dependent on the context in which they occur, there are aspects that can be generalized across operations to allow for better protection against attacks.  These resources will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors, authorities, communities and other stakeholders to generate effective solutions to address attacks on health care at country-level."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What is hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection?", "answer": "Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can cause both acute and chronic infection.  Most people with HBV infection do not experience any symptoms when newly infected. A proportion of people develop chronic infection, which can then lead to progressive liver disease and result in cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. Chronic infection occurs in the majority (90%) of infants infected from their mothers or before 5 years of age. Those infected after the age of five years are much less likely (<5%) to develop a chronic infection."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What is the global burden of HBV?", "answer": "Worldwide, WHO estimates that 257 million people are currently living with chronic HBV infection worldwide, placing them at risk of serious illness and death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Each year, WHO estimates that chronic HBV infection causes nearly 900 000 deaths, mostly through complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The countries with the highest prevalence are in the WHO African and Western Pacific Regions, and the countries with the lowest prevalence are in the Region of the Americas and the European Region."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "How is HBV infection diagnosed?", "answer": "It is not possible, on clinical grounds, to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viruses. Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is therefore needed. Chronic infection is diagnosed by a positive test for the surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg). When a person tests positive for HBsAg, an HBV DNA test should also be done to determine how high the viral load is. Those with a high HBV viral load and with raised liver enzymes may need to be put on long-term antiviral treatment for their own health. Persons with cirrhosis are also in need of treatment. However, only a proportion of people with chronic HBV infection will require treatment. If the HBV DNA test is not available, a test for e-antigen of HBV (HBeAg) is sometimes used to give a less accurate indication of the level of virus in the blood."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "How is HBV transmitted and who is most at risk of contracting HBV infection?", "answer": "Hepatitis B is spread mainly through exposure to various body fluids, including blood, saliva, menstrual, vaginal, and seminal fluids. Worldwide, the virus is most commonly spread from mother-to-child during birth (vertical transmission) as well as through horizontal early childhood transmission, and these routes of HBV transmission are responsible for most chronic infections. Transmission can also result from unsafe injections and poor infection control practices during medical, surgical, and dental procedures, sexual transmission among men who have sex with men, and through unscreened blood donations."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "How important is mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B?", "answer": "Worldwide, the most common route of transmission of hepatitis B is mother-to-child during birth (vertical transmission) as well as through horizontal early childhood transmission. These routes of HBV transmission are also responsible for most chronic\n    infections. Therefore, prevention of these infections from mother-to-child or early childhood transmission is the most important strategy to control the HBV epidemic. Transmission of HBV from mother to child is more common in children born to women\n    who have a high level of hepatitis B virus in the blood (known as HBV viral load). In the absence of any preventive interventions, the risk of transmission from mother to child ranges from 70% to 90% for mothers with high HBV viral load (or are HBeAg-positive) and from 10% to 40% for those that are HBeAg negative. These high maternal concentrations of HBV DNA (viral load) are associated with an elevated risk of transmission, even among infants who receive the hepatitis B vaccine. For this reason, pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels may benefit from antiviral prophylaxis during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and protect their infants from becoming infected."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "Can HBV infections be prevented?", "answer": "Yes, there is a safe and effective vaccine. Three doses provide 98%-100% protection against HBV infection. WHO recommends that all infants receive a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours. This birth dose should be followed by at least 2 additional doses, given at least 4 weeks apart. Protection lasts at least 20 years and is probably lifelong. Since 1992, WHO has recommended the inclusion of the hepatitis B vaccine as part of routine vaccination services through the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Infant hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) prophylaxis (preventive treatment) shortly after birth and preventive maternal peripartum prophylaxis (preventive treatment) antivirals can provide additional protection to that provided by a timely birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "Globally, what proportion of children have received the hepatitis B vaccine?", "answer": "Major progress in the global response to HBV infection has been made through the expansion of routine hepatitis B vaccination. In 2019, coverage of 3 doses of the vaccine reached 85% worldwide compared to around 30% in 2000. However, coverage of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose remains uneven. For example, coverage of the birth dose is 43% globally and only 6% in the WHO African Region. According to latest WHO estimates, the proportion of children under five years of age chronically infected with HBV dropped to just under 1% in 2019 down from around 5% in the pre-vaccine era (the period between the 1980s and the early 2000s)."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "Why are new guidelines on use of antivirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission needed?", "answer": "WHO already recommends that all infants receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours, and that the birth dose be followed by at least 2 additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine, administered at least four weeks apart. In the 2015 WHO guidelines for prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic HBV infection, no recommendation was made for the additional use of antiviral therapy to prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission. This was because of the still limited and low-quality evidence base with several ongoing trials, and the lack of consensus as to the programmatic implications of a policy for more widespread use of antivirals in pregnancy. The new recommendations were prompted by 3 key developments. First, additional evidence has become available on the efficacy and safety of antiviral prophylaxis in pregnant women and their children. Second, WHO has received requests for updated guidance from countries and regions that had already achieved high birth dose and infant vaccination coverage but had not yet achieved the 2030 WHO elimination target of less than 0.1% prevalence of HBV in 5-year-old children. Third, data from epidemiological studies and modelling suggest that infant vaccination alone would insufficient to reach the WHO goal of 0.1% HBsAg prevalence in children by 2030, and that antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women may also be needed in some contexts."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What are the new WHO recommendations for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection?", "answer": "There are 2 new recommendations: In addition to the series of hepatitis B vaccinations (including a first dose within 24 hours of birth), WHO now recommends that pregnant women testing positive for HBV infection (HBsAg positive) with an HBV DNA viral load threshold of ≥5.3 log10\n        IU/mL (≥200,000 IU/mL) receive tenofovir prophylaxis; the preventive therapy should be provided from the 28 th week of pregnancy until at least birth. (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence ). In settings where antenatal HBV DNA testing is not available, WHO now recommends the use of HBeAg testing as an alternative to determine eligibility for tenofovir prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HBV ( conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). This is because some settings have poor access to tests that quantify an individual’s HBV viral load and determine whether a pregnant woman would be eligible for preventive treatment or prophylaxis. This\n        is especially the case in low-income settings or, rural areas where many antenatal care visits take place. Pregnant women should first be assessed for eligibility for long-term antiviral treatment based on their own health needs. If this is the case, the treatment they will receive will also ensure prophylaxis.  The indications for treatment in HBV-infected pregnant women are the same as that for non-pregnant adults, and are outlined in the 2015 Guidelines for the prevention, care and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection"}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What is the evidence to support these new recommendations?", "answer": "Evidence to inform the recommendations included two commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses, impact and cost-effectiveness modelling, an assessment of the overall balance of benefits and harms (at individual and population levels), patient/health worker values and preferences, resource use, cost-effectiveness, considerations on equity and human rights, and considerations of feasibility across the different WHO regions. A WHO-commissioned systematic review of 129 studies showed a substantial protective effect of using antiviral prophylaxis in preventing mother-to-child transmission in infants born to HBV-infected women, regardless of the antiviral used. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the medicine of choice for treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection and also prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and has a high barrier to development of drug resistance. Use of TDF was also safe. The Guidelines Development Group also determined an HBV DNA viral load threshold of ≥5.3 log10 IU/mL (≥200,000 IU/mL) at which pregnant women are eligible to receive tenofovir prophylaxis. This is because pregnant woman with a viral load above this level may transmit HBV to their infant even when the infant receives the timely birth dose vaccine, HBIG and completes the full hepatitis B vaccine series. Although HBV DNA measurement is the reference method to determine eligibility for tenofovir prophylaxis, the use of HBeAg was recommended as an acceptable alternative test in settings where access to HBV DNA quantification is limited. This was based on a further systematic review that showed the overall sensitivity and specificity of HBeAg for diagnosis of high HBV viral load (defined as ≥5.3 log10 IU/mL) was 88.2% (95% CI: 83.9–91.5) and 92.6% (95% CI: 90–94.5) respectively. Overall, HBeAg has a high sensitivity but lower specificity for predicting the risk of mother-to-child transmission. A global values and preferences survey showed a broad level of acceptability of HBV testing in pregnant women with use of antivirals in those eligible, but concerns about potential costs."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "How feasible will it be to implement these new recommendations?", "answer": "Experience from elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis suggests that providing testing for pregnant women followed by antiviral prophylaxis for eligible women to prevent infection is feasible. Programmes aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV are the most mature and have shown remarkable success. For example, by the end of 2018, approximately 79% of pregnant women globally knew their HIV status, and 82% of those who tested positive for HIV received treatment. However, although the majority of women are offered HIV testing at antenatal care visits, the same is not yet true for syphilis or HBV testing. An online consultation held in 2019 as part of the guidelines development process among 153 health care workers, 56 programme managers and 81 civil society representatives reported that 77% of respondents felt it was feasible to provide HBV testing and offer eligible pregnant women tenofovir prophylaxis. Challenges reported by stakeholders included the high cost and low availability of HBV viral load assessment, inadequate training of health care workers, limited knowledge of HBV infection among women living with HBV infection, and a lack of capacity and infrastructure to test and treat pregnant women. These issues will need to be addressed to enable full implementation of routine testing of all pregnant women, as well as the use of antivirals in those with high HBV viral load or HBeAg status."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What are the key messages for countries and regions?", "answer": "WHO regions are faced with different scenarios with respect to prevalence of HBV infection, service coverage of immunization (including birth dose), and in availability of commodities for diagnostics, antiviral prophylaxis and treatment. The implementation of the different recommendations to prevent mother-to-child transmission may therefore vary by region. Universal immunization of infants with the HBV vaccine, including a timely birth dose, is the foundation of programmes to prevent HBV infection at birth and in the first years of life in all settings. Countries that have not yet reached the 2020 goal of 1% HBsAg prevalence among children aged 5 years through vaccination should focus their efforts on increasing their coverage of infant hepatitis B vaccination, and a timely birth dose. This applies particularly to the African and Eastern Mediterranean region. However, for regions and countries that have already achieved a high coverage of hepatitis B infant vaccination, and the birth dose, implementation of these new recommendations for peripartum tenofovir prophylaxis in pregnant women with high viral loads would help further prevent perinatal HBV infections. This applies particularly to countries in the Regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia. In the Americas and the European region, testing in view of prophylaxis is already been used and these guidelines can provide an additional reference."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What are the cost-effectiveness considerations?", "answer": "Scaling up access to a timely birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is the most cost-effective option for preventing infection; this single intervention delivers the greatest health benefit for the lowest cost. However, in countries that have already achieved high hepatitis B vaccination coverage and, as a result, reduction in infections due to horizontal transmission in early childhood, mother-to-child vertical infections now account for a higher proportion of the remaining transmission. In these settings, routine testing for HBV infection among pregnant women, and providing tenofovir prophylaxis for those who are eligible, is an additional opportunity to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV. This complementary intervention may be cost-effective in some regions depending on the costs of diagnostics (ie. HBV DNA or HBeAg), and on how such a strategy is implemented."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "Are any countries already implementing the new recommendations?", "answer": "Countries in several regions with a low burden of HBV infection have gained some experience in the use of peripartum prophylaxis, especially in the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe. Further expanded implementation of the recommendations for peripartum prophylaxis would prevent more perinatal HBV infections. In the WHO Region of the Americas , in 2017, 24 countries were routinely testing pregnant women for HBsAg, and 22 countries providing HBIG for exposed newborns. In the WHO European Region (mostly high-income countries with low baseline prevalence of HBV infection) some countries have not implemented universal hepatitis B vaccination but instead rely on testing all pregnant women and then providing targeted birth dose vaccine to children born to HBsAg-positive mothers. In the WHO South East Asian Region , antiviral prophylaxis has been used in certain countries where HBV is highly endemic and mother-to-child transmission is common, such as in Thailand. In the WHO Western Pacific Region , despite achieving overall high vaccination coverage including birth dose, there are some countries that still have a very high HBV prevalence in the general population and also large populations. As a result, breakthrough infections that occur despite vaccination still account for a significant number of mother-to-child infections.  A number of these countries have spearheaded efforts to further reduce mother-to-child transmission, including the use of antiviral prophylaxis and follow up of exposed infants. For example, in China, universal antenatal testing for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis has been offered since 2011, and comprehensive interventions including antiviral prophylaxis were established in three provinces as part of pilot projects on triple elimination. Other countries, have established pilot projects for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HBV in four states (Malaysia), updated national guidelines for EMTCT to include HBV and HCV (Mongolia), developed triple elimination national action plans (Cambodia and Vietnam) or frameworks (Philippines and Papua New Guinea). In the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions , experience with peripartum prophylaxis is still very limited, and the priority is to expand coverage of vaccination that remains heterogeneous."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus", "question": "What is ‘triple elimination” and are any regions implementing triple elimination of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B?", "answer": "‘Triple elimination’ is an initiative that promotes the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of three infections - HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus, which are all prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Two WHO regions – the Region of the Americas and also the Western Pacific Region – have triple elimination plans and a framework for triple elimination. In 2016, the WHO Region of the Americas endorsed “EMTCT Plus,” a new framework for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, HBV, syphilis, and Chagas disease. Several countries in this region have introduced antiviral prophylaxis for pregnant women. In 2017, the WHO Regional Committee of the Western Pacific Region endorsed the Regional framework for the triple elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis in Asia and the Pacific, 2018–2030. The framework proposes a coordinated approach to combatting these 3 diseases through access to quality reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care. A number of countries in the region including China are spearheading this effort and have developed triple elimination national action plans and frameworks."}

{"topic": "/attacks-on-healthcare-initiative-documenting-the-problem", "question": "What are attacks on health care?", "answer": "WHO defines an attack on health care as any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services during emergencies. The nature and types of attacks vary across contexts and can range from violence with heavy weapons to psychological threats and intimidation. Examples of types of attacks on health can include: Violence with individual weapons Violence with heavy weapons Psychological violence/threat of violence/intimidation Obstruction to delivery of care Assault without weapons Sexual assault Denial of access to services Armed or violent search of health resource Removal of health care assets Setting fire to health resources Militarization of health care facility Removal of health care assets"}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-healthcare-initiative-documenting-the-problem", "question": "What is the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care?", "answer": "The Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) is a global, standardized monitoring system to collect primary data of attacks on health care. WHO works closely with partners on the ground to gather relevant information, which is then reviewed by the WHO country office, and published in near-real time to the publicly available website: ssa.who.int . The SSA is used in emergency-affected countries and fragile settings that are priority areas of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme. As of December 2023, there are 21 reporting countries. Furthermore, the SSA website aggregates the global data and allows users to filter the data for tailored analysis: Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) dashboard ."}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-healthcare-initiative-documenting-the-problem", "question": "Is all of the data publicly available?", "answer": "The SSA publishes data that is collected and verified by WHO on the affected health resources, types of attacks and number of affected personnel. Information such as the date of an attack, the country in which it occurred and its associated certainty\r\n    level is also available. Furthermore, the SSA website aggregates the global data and allows users to filter the data for tailored analysis. The SSA has specific measures in place to protect the confidentiality of sources and to prevent any further harm to survivors of an attack and affected population. For this reason, WHO does not share data beyond information published on the SSA. The SSA methodology paper can be downloaded from WHO’s publication platform."}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-healthcare-initiative-documenting-the-problem", "question": "Does WHO seek to identify the perpetrators of the attacks? Why or why not?", "answer": "WHO does not collect nor verify information on perpetrators as WHO does not have the mandate nor the capacity to address the question of perpetrators of attacks. WHO’s objective is not to instigate action in relation to accountability but to increase awareness of the issue by highlighting the extent and consequences of the problem, so as to instigate action to prevent attacks from occurring."}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-health-care-initiative", "question": "What is the Attacks on Health Care Initiative?", "answer": "Background In 2012, World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 was adopted. In this resolution, Member States requested WHO to provide leadership at the global level in collecting and disseminating information on attacks on health care in complex humanitarian emergencies. WHO subsequently created the Attacks on Health Care (AHC) initiative to systematically collect evidence on attacks on health care, to advocate for the end of such attacks, and to promote best practices for protecting health care from attacks. Goal The vision of the initiative is to ensure provision of essential life-saving health services to emergency-affected populations unhindered by any form of violence or obstruction. Ultimately, WHO seeks to ensure that: Health workers everywhere can provide health care in a safe and protected environment; Health workers are protected, resilient and equipped with knowledge and resources; Parties to conflict understand and uphold their responsibilities under International Humanitarian Law; Health care delivery is not disrupted by attacks; and All forms of violence against health care stop. Objectives To achieve this mission, three main objectives and work streams of the initiative have been established: Develop a body of evidence on the nature and extent of attacks on health care; Increase commitment to action through strong advocacy to end attacks; Assess the impact of attacks on health care delivery, and document good practices to prevent and mitigate consequences of attacks."}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-health-care-initiative", "question": "Why has WHO undertaken the Attacks on Health Care initiative?", "answer": "WHA Resolution 65.20 (2012) called on WHO’s Director-General to provide global leadership in the development of methods for systematic collection and dissemination of data on attacks on health facilities, health workers, health transport and patients in complex humanitarian emergencies, in coordination with other relevant United Nations bodies and partners. The initiative was created in response to this resolution with the understanding that data collection needs to be supported by other areas of work, such as strong advocacy and guidance on how to prevent attacks and increase resilience of health systems, in order to adequately address the issue."}

{"topic": "/attacks-on-health-care-initiative", "question": "What health resources can be affected by attacks on health care?", "answer": "All health resources can suffer from attacks. Health resources include all personnel, supplies, facilities, transport and warehouses that play a role in the delivery of health services, as well as patients themselves."}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-health-care-initiative", "question": "What are the reasons behind attacks on health care?", "answer": "During emergencies, attacks on health care come in many shapes and forms and stem from various reasons depending on the context in which they took place. To better understand these reasons, it is important to first consider and analyse each attack within their context. Although understanding the context of an attack alone will not answer the full question of why attacks on health care occur, it provides the necessary tools to investigate the roots of the problem. To illustrate, the reasons behind the destruction of a health facility in Libya may be drastically different from those that motivated the destruction of a health centre in DRC during an Ebola outbreak. In Libya, the shelling of a health facility occurs against the backdrop of years of violent conflict, in which attacks on health care have become one of its manifestations. On the other hand, the attacks that took place in DRC during the 2014 Ebola outbreak seem to have targeted health facilities as a reaction to imposed public health measures. At this stage, more research is needed to identify drivers of violence against health care, but looking at the local contexts in which they occur already provides useful clues."}
{"topic": "/attacks-on-health-care-initiative", "question": "What are the consequences of attacks on health care?", "answer": "Attacks not only endanger health care providers; they can also deprive people of urgently needed care. The full extent of the impact of attacks on health care is not yet known. The short-term and more immediate effects are better understood in terms of the facilities or health workers lost, but a more in-depth investigation of the mid- to long-term impact is required. WHO aims to better understand these consequences as defined under the third objective of the initiative- investigating the impact of attacks on health care to the health of the affected populations and health service delivery, availability and accessibility. Furthermore, WHO seeks to document good practices undertaken by various actors to prevent attacks and mitigate the consequences of attacks. These findings will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors to implement at the country level."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "Which parasite causes HAT?", "answer": "The disease is caused by trypanosomes that are unicellular parasitic protozoa. A large number of species and subspecies of trypanosomes have been described, but only two subspecies can cause HAT. Different species of trypanosomes infect a variety of different vertebrates, including animals and humans. Most species are transmitted by insects. HAT occurs only in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei brucei , namely Trypanosoma brucei gambiense ( T.b. gambiense ) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense ( T.b. rhodesiense )."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "Why do we specify human in African trypanosomiasis?", "answer": "African trypanosomiasis also occurs in animals. Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is caused by other trypanosome species and subspecies than those affecting human beings. All these diseases have an important economic impact on the development of agriculture in Africa. Those affecting cattle are undoubtedly the most important economically since they are a major cause for reduced meat and milk production and draught power for agricultural production. Occasional infections in humans with these trypanosomes have been described."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "How is the parasite that causes HAT transmitted to humans?", "answer": "Trypanosomiasis is transmitted to humans and animals by a blood‐sucking insect, the tsetse fly. Both male and female tsetse flies can transmit the infection. Tsetse flies include all the species in the genus Glossina, but not all the species are recognized as vectors of sleeping sickness. Tsetse flies are found on the African continent south of the Sahara. Wild and domestic animals can host these parasites and may represent a reservoir of infection for the tsetse flies. Vertical transmission (mother to child) can happen in infected pregnant women. Blood transfusion and laboratory infection have been described but they are rare."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "Are there differences between the sleeping sickness caused by T.b. gambiense and T.b. rhodesiense?", "answer": "Yes, there are several differences between these two forms of the disease. First, the transmission circuit differs. T.b. gambiense is transmitted mainly from an infected human to a tsetse fly and then to another human. The transmission cycle of T.b. rhodesiense involves to a great extent domestic and wild animals that act as a reservoir of infection for the tsetse flies. Humans may act as a reservoir also when transmission is intensified during epidemics. Secondly, there are major differences in the symptoms. Infection with T.b. rhodesiense is acute, lasting from a few weeks to several months, while T.b. gambiense infection is chronic, generally progressing slowly over several years."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "What are the symptoms of sleeping sickness?", "answer": "HAT progresses in two stages. Following the bite of the infected fly, the parasite multiplies in the lymph and the blood of the person bitten, causing unspecific symptoms and signs such as headaches, fever, weakness, pain in the joints and lymphadenopathy. People who become infected may or may not show signs of illness immediately. Over time the parasite crosses the blood–brain barrier and migrates to the central nervous system. This second stage causes various neurological changes including sleep disorders (hence the name “sleeping sickness”), deep sensory disturbances, abnormal tone and mobility, ataxia, psychiatric disorders, seizures, coma and ultimately death."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "How is sleeping sickness diagnosed?", "answer": "Diagnosis requires parasitological tests to confirm the presence of the parasite in any body fluid, usually in the blood and lymph. The disease stage (haemo-lymphatic or meningo-encephalitic) is determined by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. Lumbar puncture for staging is usually performed immediately after parasitological diagnosis of trypanosome infection or when indications of infection are present that justify this invasive intervention (e.g. indicative clinical signs or strong serological suspicion)."}
{"topic": "/neglected-topical-diseases-sleeping-sickness-(human-african-trypanosomiasis)", "question": "Can sleeping sickness be treated?", "answer": "Sleeping sickness is difficult to treat because of the toxicity and complex administration of the medicines currently available for treatment. Furthermore, parasite resistance to existing medicines is always a risk. Five medicines are registered for the treatment of HAT: pentamidine, suramin, melarsoprol, eflornithine and fexinidazole. A sixth medicine, nifurtimox, is used in combination under special authorizations. However, none of them are anodyne as all have a certain level of toxicity."}
{"topic": "/polio-transition", "question": "What is polio transition planning?", "answer": "Transition planning is a critical part of preparing for the polio-free world. As we come closer to achieving eradication, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) will scale down its operations, and will come to a close soon after certification of eradication. Over three decades of operation, GPEI funding has helped build significant infrastructure for disease surveillance, social mobilization, and vaccine delivery; developed in-depth knowledge and expertise; and learned valuable lessons about reaching the most vulnerable and hard-to- reach populations on earth. Some of the key functions, infrastructure, and knowledge supported by GPEI will need to be transitioned into other programme areas, either within the national governments or at WHO. Essential polio functions needed at the country-level for implementing the polio post–certification strategy, that are currently financed by GPEI, will also need to be transitioned to national governments or supported by WHO in the medium term."}
{"topic": "/polio-transition", "question": "Why do we need to transition polio assets?", "answer": "The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategy identifies three main aims of transition planning: Keep the world polio free After polio has been eradicated, some activities and functions of the polio programme will need to continue to make sure the world stays polio-free. These include: Proper containment of the virus in essential facilities so it isn’t accidentally or intentionally released Disease surveillance, to rapidly detect the re-emergence of the virus Outbreak response capabilities, for quick and effective response to any polio events Continued vaccination, so that people are protected in the event of an outbreak A governance and management structure for these ongoing essential functions National governments, WHO and other GPEI partners must plan for some essential functions and activities to be incorporated into existing public health programs in order to keep the world polio-free. In consultation with key stakeholders, GPEI is developing a polio Post-Certification Strategy to define, at a global level, the technical standards that will be needed in order to maintain a polio-free world. Transition polio assets to support other health priorities GPEI funds have established an extensive infrastructure of global disease surveillance systems, vaccine supply and logistics networks, and a network of more than 140 polio laboratories. These capacities help reach populations in areas with little to no infrastructure. Given that GPEI-funded infrastructure already supports a wide range of health initiatives like routine immunization, measles campaigns, maternal and child health programmes, humanitarian emergencies and disease outbreak, and sanitation and hygiene programmes, the closure of the polio programme therefore presents a potential risk to these programmes. Capture and transfer the lessons learned The polio programme, over many decades, has learned many valuable lessons on reaching hard-to-reach and high-risk populations, working in conflict affected areas, harnessing global commitment to a cause, and other challenging areas. A key component of transition planning is to capture and share these lessons for the benefit of the broader development community."}
{"topic": "/polio-transition", "question": "What is the process of polio transition planning?", "answer": "Transition planning is a process of analysing the infrastructure, knowledge, and functions of the polio programme, and managing their scale down or transfer to other health programmes. The process involves mapping these assets at country, regional and global levels, and conducting an analysis against national and global health and development needs. At the country level, within the 16 polio priority transition countries (Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan), significant efforts are under way to ensure government ownership of the national polio transition planning process, systematic mapping of all polio assets, identification of key public health priorities that could benefit from the polio infrastructure, engagement of stakeholders, development of a costed national polio transition plan, and the development of a financing strategy for implementing the transition plan. WHO, at all three organizational levels, and partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative have been extensively involved in this process. Within WHO, polio transition planning is a corporate, WHO-wide priority. Polio transition planning will have to address the risks and opportunities facing the organization. It will need to deal with managing the significant human resources, financing, country capacity, and programmatic risks faced by the organization as a result of the scaling down of the polio programme. It will also be an opportunity for the organization to integrate the polio assets and capacities to strengthen health systems in countries to help achieve the goals of the 13th General Programme of Work of WHO and the SDGs. An effective and strategic polio transition plan will ensure that essential functions are maintained in countries, either through national systems or other WHO programme areas, in order to sustain a polio-free world. The plan will also endeavour to strengthen immunization services and emergency preparedness and response capacities in polio transition countries through the integration of polio assets and functions."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "Can COVID-19 be transmitted at the workplace?", "answer": "COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces. Exposure can occur at the workplace, while travelling to work, during work-related travel to an area with local community transmission, as well as on the way to and from the workplace."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What is the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the workplace?", "answer": "The risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace depends on the likelihood of coming within 1 metre of others, in having frequent physical contact with people who may be infected with COVID-19, and through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "How can people assess the risk for exposure to COVID-19 in their workplace and plan for preventive measures?", "answer": "Managers with the support of an occupational health and safety advisor should carry out rapid risk assessments to determine the possibility of exposure risk in order to put in place preventive measures. This should be done for each specific work setting and each job. Low exposure risk Jobs or work without frequent, close contact with the general public or others. Workers in this group have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers. Examples of such jobs may include remote workers (i.e., working from home), office workers without frequent close contact with others and workers providing teleservices. Medium exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close, frequent contact with the general public or others. This risk level may apply to workers who have frequent and close contact with the people in high-population-density work environments (e.g. food markets, bus stations, public transport, and other work activities where physical distancing of at least 1 metre may be difficult to observe), or tasks that require close and frequent contact between co-workers. This may also include frequent contact with people returning from areas with community transmission. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, home deliveries, accommodation, construction, police and security, public transport, and water and sanitation. High exposure risk Jobs or tasks with close contact with people who may be more likely to have COVID-19, as well as contact with objects and surfaces possibly contaminated with the virus. Examples include transporting people known or suspected to have COVID-19 without separation between the driver and the passenger, providing domestic services or home care for people with COVID-19, and having contact with the deceased who were known or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death. Jobs that may fall under this category include domestic workers, social care workers, personal transport  and home delivery providers and home repair technicians (plumbers, electricians) who have to provide services in the homes of people with COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "Who should carry out the workplace risk assessment?", "answer": "Employers and managers, in consultation with workers, should carry out and regularly update the risk assessment for work-related exposure to COVID-19, preferably with the support of occupational health services."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What are the key considerations for the workplace risk assessment?", "answer": "For each risk assessment, consider the environment, the task, the threat, resources available, such as personal protective equipment, and the feasibility of protective measures. The risk assessment should also extend to collective accommodation provided by the employer for workers, such as dormitories.  Essential public services, such as security and police, food retail, accommodation, public transport, deliveries, water and sanitation, and other frontline workers may be at an increased risk of exposure to occupational hazards for health and safety. Workers who may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness because of age or pre-existing medical conditions should be considered in the risk assessment for individuals."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "How should employers decide when to open, close or re-open workplaces and/or suspend or downscale work activities?", "answer": "Deciding to close or re-open a workplace or suspend or downscale work activities should rely on the risk assessment, the capacity to put in place protective measures and the level of compliance, and recommendations of national authorities."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What key measures to protect against COVID-19 should be undertaken in ALL workplaces?", "answer": "Measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19 that apply to all workplaces and all people at the workplace include frequent hand-washing or disinfection with alcohol based hand sanitizer, respiratory hygiene such as covering coughs, physical distancing of at least 1 metre or more according to the national recommendations, wearing of masks where distancing is not possible, regular environmental cleaning and disinfection, and limiting unnecessary travel. Clear policies and messages, training, and education for staff and managers to increase awareness of COVID-19 are essential. The management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts is also critical e.g. requiring workers who are unwell or who develop symptoms to stay at home, self isolate and contact a medical professional or the local COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at medium risk?", "answer": "Workplaces for jobs at medium risk require daily cleaning and disinfection at least two times a day of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including all shared rooms, surfaces, floors, bathrooms, and changing rooms. Consider suspending any activity where physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be implemented in full. If this is not possible, increase ventilation, implement enhanced regular hand hygiene, and require staff to wear appropriate face masks, goggles, gloves and work clothes during cleaning procedures that generate splashes, providing training on their use. Organize changing and washing of work clothes at the workplace, so that workers to do take them home."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at high risk?", "answer": "In work areas at high risk, assess the possibility of suspending the activity; enhance regular hand hygiene; provide medical masks, disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection for workers who must work in the homes of people who are suspected or known to have COVID-19; train workers in infection prevention and control practices and use of personal protective equipment; avoid assigning tasks with high risk to workers who have pre-existing medical conditions, are pregnant, or older than 60 years of age."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What should be taken into consideration when setting a physical distance at the workplace?", "answer": "WHO recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 1 metre between each person in all settings, including in workplaces. Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with. In order to support compliance with national or local recommendations, implement physical distance guidelines in a way that is practical and feasible in the context of work tasks, and which is acceptable to both workers and employers. Stimulate workers to comply with physical distancing norms also at events outside the workplace, in the community, and in dormitories. Risk assessment and consultation between employers and workers is very important for setting up and implementing physical distancing measures at the workplace. This may require modification of workstations, changing the use of common spaces and transport vehicles, staggered work shifts, split teams and other measures to reduce social mixing at the workplace. If physical distancing measures at the workplace are not feasible for specific work tasks, consider whether the work can be suspended, and if this is not possible, apply additional protective measures, such as the use of screens, sneeze guards,  face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, ventilation and disinfection. Physical distancing alone can’t prevent COVID-19 transmission, it is important that it is combined with other public health measures, such as hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental clean-up and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects, ventilation, wearing face masks and a policy of staying at home if unwell."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What are the rights, duties and responsibilities of employers?", "answer": "Employers, workers, and their organizations should collaborate with health authorities to prevent and control COVID-19. Cooperation between management and workers and their representatives is essential for workplace‐related prevention measures. International labour standards on the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers in occupational safety and health should be fully respected. Employers, in consultation with workers and their representatives, should plan and implement measures to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 at the workplace through engineering and administrative controls, and provide personal protective equipment and clothing according to the risk assessment. Such measures should not involve any expenditure on the part of the workers. Special measures are needed to protect workers at higher risk of developing severe disease, such as those age 60 and over, or with underlying medical conditions, upon recommendation of the occupational health services. Workers in the informal economy and digital labour platforms, those in small enterprises, domestic and migrant workers should not be left behind in the protection of their health and safety at work and their livelihood . There should be no social stigma or discrimination at the workplace for any reason, including access to information and protection from COVID-19, occupational health services and mental health and psychosocial support. If COVID-19 is contracted through occupational exposure, it could be considered an occupational disease and, if so determined, should be reported and compensated according to the international labour standards and the national schemes for employment injury benefits."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What are the rights, duties and responsibilities of workers?", "answer": "Workers are responsible to follow the measures for occupational safety and health and infection prevention and control established for their workplace, and to participate in training provided by the employer. Workers should report to their supervisor any situation which may present an imminent and serious danger to their life or health. Workers have the right to remove themselves from any work situation that they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to their life or health, and should be protected from any undue consequences as a result of exercising this right."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "How can workplaces plan for the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19?", "answer": "Workplaces should develop action plans to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 as part of the business continuity plan and according to the results of the risk assessments and the epidemiological situation. The action plan and preventive measures should be regularly monitored and updated. Workers and their representatives should be consulted and should participate in the development, monitoring and updating of the workplace COVID-19. It is very important to monitor the effectiveness of preventive measures, and the compliance of workers, visitors, customers, clients and sub-contractors with the measures. The plans should be updated when someone with known or suspected COVID-19 is at the workplace."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "Can the return to the workplace be immediate after public measures are lifted?", "answer": "The return to work premises should be carefully planned ahead, with preventive measures put in place according to the risk assessment of the different jobs and work tasks. All possible risks for safety and health should be assessed, such as risks resulting from reduced maintenance of machines and facilities during the closure period.  If a return to work is rushed and not done in a phased and cautious manner, it puts lives at risk, and threatens to undermine efforts to restore social and economic activity."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "Does WHO recommend thermal testing of people entering a workplace?", "answer": "Temperature screening cannot detect all cases of COVID-19, since infected individuals may not have fever early in the course of infection or illness, such as during the incubation period or just before other symptoms begin, even though they may already be infectious. Some people may reduce fever with a fever-reducing medication if they are concerned about the possible consequences of not coming to work. Relying on temperature screening alone will not stop the spread of COVID-19 at work. Thermal screening at the workplace can be considered part of a package of measures to prevent and control COVID-19 at the workplace. Workers should be encouraged to self-monitor their health, possibly with the use of questionnaires, and take their own temperature regularly at home. Workplaces should adopt “stay at home if unwell” and flexible sick leave policies to discourage workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from coming to the workplaces."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "Does WHO recommend workers wear masks at the workplace (office or others)? If yes, what type of masks?", "answer": "Wearing masks depends on the risk assessment. For jobs and tasks that carry a medium or high risk, for people aged 60 and older, and for those with underlying health conditions, a medical mask and other personal protective equipment should be provided. Fabric masks or face coverings are currently recommended for younger people and those with no symptoms where physical distancing is not achievable. This prevents the spread of virus from the wearer (who could have COVID-19 but no symptoms) to others. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering in low risk workplaces should be in line with national or local guidelines. Masks may carry some risks if not used properly."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "Are there any directives on office ventilation and air conditioning use?", "answer": "There should be fresh, clean air in all workplaces. For jobs and work tasks at medium or high risk of exposure, WHO recommends an increased ventilation rate through natural aeration or artificial ventilation, preferably without re-circulation of the air. In case of air recirculation, filters should be cleaned regularly."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-health-and-safety-in-the-workplace", "question": "What mental health and psychosocial support should be provided to workers during COVID-19?", "answer": "COVID-19 is associated with a range of concerns, such as fear of falling ill and dying, of being socially excluded, placed in quarantine, or losing a livelihood. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common reactions for people in the context of COVID-19. Mental health and psychosocial support should be made available to all workers. Comprehensive risk assessments can help identify and mitigate related occupational hazards for mental health Full Guideline Document Considerations for public health and social measures in the workplace in the context of COVID-19 is accessible at: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/considerations-for-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-workplace-in-the-context-of-covid-19"}
{"topic": "/dementia-information-for-caregivers", "question": "How do I reach out to others for help when caring for someone with dementia?", "answer": "Caring for someone with dementia can be overwhelming and does not need to be a lonely experience. Remember that you are not alone – ask for help. Describe your problem and what kind of help you need. It might be help with cleaning or preparing meals, support for activities with the person with dementia, or emotional support or information. Be flexible - you may not get exactly what you asked for, but it is a start and will be helpful. Organizations that provide these types of support may be available in your local community, or online. Your local Alzheimer’s association or your local doctor can be a good place to start. For more information see iSupport Module 2 Being a caregiver , Lesson 3 Involving others ."}
{"topic": "/dementia-information-for-caregivers", "question": "How can I care for myself?", "answer": "Social support is important – stay connected as much as possible. Talk regularly to someone you trust and who understands your situation and feelings. This might be family, friends, a community, religious or spiritual leader, a neighbour, or a volunteer. Focus on relaxation – it can make you feel less tense. It can also help you be more effective in getting tasks done and free up more of your time for doing things you enjoy. Relaxation is different for everyone. Some people find meditating or doing a breathing exercise relaxing. Others enjoy stretching, reading a book, listening to music, or doing activities with the person they care for. Find what works best for you and try to do something relaxing every day. You may think that events make you feel angry, sad or guilty. However, it is how you think about them that makes you feel that way. It can be helpful to identify the specific situations that make you feel bad and what your thoughts are in that situation. You might also want to identify what would be a more helpful way of thinking and how more helpful thoughts can make you feel better.

{"topic": "/dementia-information-for-caregivers", "question": "How do I ensure that the person with dementia continues to receive care if I am no longer able to provide it?", "answer": "Plan in advance – ask the person with dementia about their care preferences, including by whom and where they would like care to be provided. Identify people who would be willing to provide support if you can no longer provide care. Plan for costs of future care and discuss preferences in case of more advanced care needs and end-of-life decisions. Gather information to make informed choices. Make decisions together and talk with your family, friends, doctor, any others close to you and the person with dementia. Prepare instructions that reflect the wishes of the person with dementia in accordance with the legal framework in your country. For more information see iSupport Module 2 Being a caregiver , Lessons 1 The journey together and 3 Supported decision-making . Consult the website of Alzheimer Disease International for information related to caring for someone with dementia."}
{"topic": "/dementia-information-for-caregivers", "question": "How can I respond to changes in the person with dementia?", "answer": "As dementia progresses, the person with dementia may change. Changes may include agitation, depression, anxiety or apathy, becoming withdrawn or overly suspicious, having difficulty sleeping or changes in judgement. The person may also show signs of confusion, deterioration of existing cognitive problems (e.g. memory), delusions and hallucinations, and repetitive behaviours or wandering. Identify the changes and what appears to be triggering them. Think about the best ways to respond that will be the least distressing to you and the person with dementia. Try different responses and approaches – your first response may not always work. If the person has serious and constant mood changes or if you think that they are in danger of harming themselves, seek immediate medical advice. For more information see iSupport Module 5 Dealing with behavior changes , Lesson 1 Introduction to behavior changes and Lesson 4 Depression, anxiety and apathy. Lessons 2 through 9 provide additional information about other behavior changes. Consult Alzheimer’s Disease International’s webpage for information related to caring for someone with dementia."}
{"topic": "/dementia-information-for-caregivers", "question": "How can I provide everyday care to the person with dementia?", "answer": "As dementia progresses, you may need to provide more care that you are currently doing. Make sure that the person is eating and drinking. You may need to regularly remind them to do so. Adjust their diet according to their preferences and health. Remember to keep inedible items, sharp objects, household chemicals and flammable materials in a safe place. Modifying the environment can help reduce incontinence accidents. For example, put a picture of a toilet on the bathroom door. Remind the person to go to the bathroom regularly. Consider using incontinence aids and equipment if necessary. Do not blame the person for accidents. Engage the person in personal care by helping them do as much as they can themselves. Try modifying the environment, for example by switching from a shower to a sponge bath, and provide guidance. Be mindful of falls – use a non-slip shower or bath mat. The person with dementia may resist when you try to assist with personal care. Be compassionate and try to understand why. It is important to maintain routines similar to the ones that the person had before developing dementia. Be prepared to adapt routines as necessary as the abilities of the person change over time. For more information see iSupport Module 4 Providing everyday care , Lessons 1 Eating and drinking – more pleasant mealtimes , 2 Eating, drinking and preventing health problems , 3 Toileting and continence care, and 4 Personal care . Consult Alzheimer’s Disease International’s webpage for information related to caring for someone with dementia."}
{"topic": "/dementia-information-for-caregivers", "question": "How can I communicate effectively with the person with dementia?", "answer": "Dementia can often make communication difficult. This can have an impact on your relationship with the person you care for and can be frustrating, upsetting or irritating for both of you. Get attention in a respectful way. Speak clearly, slowly and at a volume that is comfortable for them. Speak face-to-face and at eye level. You might also try lightly tapping a hand, arm or front of the shoulder, or calling the person by their name or a nickname that they recognize. Ask or tell the person with dementia one thing at a time. Use short sentences and simple words that the person with dementia can understand. Repeat information calmly, as often as necessary. When needed, change from open-ended to close-ended questions that can be answered by yes or no. Make sure that there are no distracting background noises such as a television or radio. Try to stay in control of your feelings. Sometimes, you might not understand what the person you care for is trying to say. It is important that you take the person seriously – they are trying to tell you something. Be patient and give the person time to find their words. Pay attention to their reactions, including facial expressions and body language. Show compassion about the feelings that the person expresses. Remember that saying something positive or complimenting the person can make them feel good.

{"topic": "/q-a-on-strengthening-infection-prevention-control-in-healthcare-facilities-focus-on-private-sector-webinar-on-ipc-practices", "question": "What are aerosol generating procedures?", "answer": "Aerosols are produced when air currents move across the surface of a film of liquid, generating small particles at the air–liquid interface. The particle size is inversely related to the velocity of air. Therefore, if a procedure causes air to travel at high velocity over the respiratory mucosa and epithelium, there is potential risk of the production of tiny aerosols (e.g. droplet nuclei). An aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) is defined as any procedure on a patient that can induce the production of aerosols of various sizes, including droplet nuclei. AGPs associated with documented increase in risk of pathogen transmission include intubation and related procedures (manual ventilation and suctioning), cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopy, autopsy and surgery where high-speed devices (e.g. saw or drill) are used."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-hydroxychloroquine", "question": "What is the Solidarity Trial?", "answer": "The Solidarity Trial is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. The treatment options are: Remdesivir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a. The treatment options were originally selected based on evidence from laboratory, animal and clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine was originally included in the trial but this arm was stopped, as of 17 June 2020, as evidence showed it did not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care. Over 100 countries have expressed an interest in participating in the trial and WHO is actively supporting more than 60 of them, including with the following: ethical and regulatory approvals of the WHO core protocol; identification of hospitals participating in the trial; training of hospital clinicians on the web-based randomization and data system; shipping the trial drugs as requested by each participating country. As of 3 June 2020, more than 3500 patients have been recruited in 35 countries, with over 400 hospitals actively recruiting patients. Interim trial analyses are monitored by a Global Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which is an independent group of experts."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "What is the purpose of the WHO Learning Strategy?", "answer": "The purpose of the WHO Learning Strategy is to create a culture that establishes the norm of lifelong learning in public health, removing barriers to learning and promoting excellence to improve people’s health using the most effective education standards and adult learning know-how. It will propose a framework and approach by WHO on learning and training for its own workforce, as well as how it will support learning externally, across diverse sectors, for the achievement of global, national and individual health goals, to ensure people achieve the best levels of health possible."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "For whom is the WHO Learning Strategy intended?", "answer": "The Strategy is a reference for any institution or Member State which aspires to support lifelong learning in the health workforce and others who contribute to the achievement of health goals. It is expected to, amongst other things, contribute to the work of the WHO Academy when it becomes operational and shape how WHO approaches learning, education and training."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "Why do we need a WHO Learning Strategy?", "answer": "The current approaches to learning, education and training of the health workforce, personnel from other sectors who contribute to health and health volunteers are outdated, do not use the best learning science, and often do not take onto account that\r\n    all personnel need lifelong learning in health. Continued professional education and development is limited to a few high-status professions and are not equitably available where they are most needed in low- and middle-income countries. This means\r\n    that global and national ambitions to meet goals for health, such as the Sustainable Development Goal 3, are unlikely to be met. In the current situation, 95% of countries are on target NOT to meet SDG3. The fourth industrial revolution that we are\r\n    currently experiencing not only provide unprecedented and fast evolution in digital technology and biotechnology, but also requires millions of personnel to continuously learn new knowledge and skills and to upskill themselves even if they remain\r\n    in the same jobs, especially in health. Training and education in health require lifelong learning but using approaches that everyone can benefit from it. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that despite the massive investment and training in the health sector, competencies and capacities have not been adequately transferred to health workforce and others. A global strategy, based on evidence and science,\r\n    tapping into the massive digital and social innovation that are hallmark of the current era, and framing the contribution of learning to the future of public health, is both needed and relevant."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "Who will implement the WHO Learning Strategy?", "answer": "Within the World Health Organization, the proposed WHO Academy will be facilitating and monitoring the implementation of the Strategy. Member States and any institution or organization that wants to modernize its learning, education and training activities so that health objectives are met can use this Strategy as a guide or reference to build its own action plans."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "When will the WHO Learning Strategy be ready?", "answer": "The WHO Learning Strategy is currently being drafted and it will be subject to internal reviews within WHO and external, expert consultations, before being published, in quarter 2 2021."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "What are the benefits of the WHO Learning Strategy?", "answer": "The WHO Learning Strategy will guide WHO’s approach to learning in health to accelerate the achievement of global, national and individual health goals ensuring rights, equity and quality; harnessing the potential of digital technologies; and using adult learning and behavioural change know-how. The Learning Strategy will not replace academic and other formal training of public health professionals but will supplement it instead. It will outline a unified approach that is both modern and futuristic for the lifelong learning of the health workforce, public health personnel, health emergency workforce and volunteers and the public who want to strengthen their own health literacy and agency for health. Institutions."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "Who will pay for the WHO Learning Strategy?", "answer": "The WHO Learning Strategy is being developed by a dedicated team, within the WHO Academy. WHO is covering the limited costs, but many experts, institutions, UN agencies and volunteers are helping for free the development of the Strategy."}
{"topic": "/who-learning-strategy", "question": "How can I participate in the development of the WHO Learning Strategy?", "answer": "An online consultation on the draft strategy is planned in March and April 2021. Please, visit our webpage to get the latest news and updates about the development process ( https://www.who.int/about/who-academy/learning-strategy ://www.who.int/about/who-academy/learning-strategy )."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "What is the WHO Academy?", "answer": "The WHO Academy will be the World Health Organization’s state-of-the-art lifelong learning centre. Now under development with the support of France, the Academy will design and scale up learning for health impact, reaching millions of health workers and others all over the world. Using the latest in adult learning science and technologies, it will enable all learners to tailor their learning experiences to meet their own needs and award them digital credentials they can use to verify their competencies and advance their careers."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "Who is the Academy targeting and what will it offer them?", "answer": "The Academy will expand access to critical learning to health workers, managers, public health officials and policy makers – as well as the WHO’s own workforce – along with everyday people serving their families and communities. It will offer multilingual learning programmes in digital, in-person and blended formats, deploying the latest evidence-based health guidance, learning technologies and advancements in the science of adult learning. The Academy will also be one of the world’s leading centres of learning and simulation on health emergency preparedness and response. There are more than 234 million people working in the health and care workforce, 70 percent of whom are women. By investing in their competencies, the Academy will accelerate gender equity and the empowerment and leadership of women."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "Why is the WHO Academy needed?", "answer": "Presently, no countries are on track to meet all the health-related targets of the SDGs.  A big part of the reason is it often takes a decade or more to implement new evidence-based health guidance into practice. Yet, medical science is doubling every three months and science and knowledge surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic was doubling every two weeks. Fortunately, adult learning methods and technologies can vastly improve the speed, efficiency and scale with which learning is conveyed to people around the world.  Using these, the WHO Academy will accelerate the implementation of the latest norms, standards and evidence and thereby equip health workers and others to save lives and make their societies healthier."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "Where will the WHO Academy be located?", "answer": "WHO Academy programmes will be globally available via its online learning experience platform, with the vast majority of its learners accessing its learning programmes online. The Academy will have a campus network with its “hub” in the Gerland Biodistrict in Lyon, France, and “spokes” across the world. The Academy Lyon Hub will serve as the Academy’s main campus and will feature high-tech and people-centred spaces designed for collaborative learning, educational research and development of learning programmes.  It will also host a world-class health emergencies simulation centre that will use the latest technologies to enable health workers to sharpen their competencies amid realistic scenarios including mass casualties and disease outbreaks."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "What types of learning programmes will the Academy have? And how many of them?", "answer": "The Academy currently has 40 programmes in design and development and is targeting the release of 100 major programmes by the end of 2023, with flagship programmes for COVID-19 vaccine equity, Universal Health Coverage, health emergencies and healthier lives."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "How and by whom can the WHO Academy be accessed?  Will people in low-bandwidth areas be able to participate?", "answer": "The Academy will be open to everyone, no matter where they are located, via desktop and mobile devices and in low-bandwidth settings.  Once launched, learners will be able to participate in the Academy’s interactive learning programmes, update their learning needs and goals, explore personalised learning recommendations, and connect with other learners around the world, as well as contribute ideas, feedback and to co-designing Academy programmes to address critical unmet needs."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "How will the WHO Academy change lifelong learning in global health?  What new approaches will it bring?", "answer": "The WHO Academy will leverage the latest learning technologies and innovations in the science of adult learning.  Digital innovations such as artificial intelligence, extended reality, serious educational games and blockchain have enabled learning experiences to become more immersive, engaging and effective at building competencies. Technology-supported experiential learning recognizes what learners already know and can tailor the experience to an individual learner’s needs – and assess the competencies they gain. It is now possible to deliver sophisticated learning programmes – with realistic simulations, personalization to user needs and intense collaboration among learners in various locations – to smartphones, mobile learning laboratories and other devices located almost anywhere in the world.  These are some of the technologies and innovations the Academy will advance and deploy."}
{"topic": "/who-academy", "question": "Why should WHO be the organization that takes on the challenge of revolutionizing lifelong learning in health?", "answer": "WHO is mandated by its own constitution to be a learning organization and to convey the latest evidence, norms, standards and practice to the worldwide health community. The organization currently offers more than 1,400 digital and in-person courses, with over 6 million enrolments in OpenWHO.org .  The WHO Academy team includes experts in adult learning, behavioural insight, communications, quality and standards, research, governance, workforce development and performance and the latest learning technologies.  The Academy team brings in leading experts across a range of areas in health from WHO’s 14,000-person workforce, over 800 collaborating centres and hundreds of expert networks to provide a robust basis to transform lifelong learning for health impact."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-genital-manifestations", "question": "What is genital schistosomiasis?", "answer": "Schistosoma haematobium is the main species causing genital manifestations but other species of schistosomiasis have been implicated. The number of people suffering from genital manifestations is not precisely known. The biological plausibility of a causal association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV has been described, and may be an important factor in increasing the risk of contracting HIV in areas or communities where both infections are coendemic."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-genital-manifestations", "question": "What are the clinical manifestations?", "answer": "The clinical manifestations of genital schistosomiasis occur both in women and in men. In men, the symptoms include epididymitis (an inflammation of the eipdidymis at the back of the testicle) which can simulate tuberculosis and associated funiculitis, indolence and possible fistulization, hemospermia, pain during urination prostatitis and others. In women, the symptomatology is unspecific because urogenital schistosomiasis can provoke gynaecological ailments. The most frequently observed signs and symptoms are abdominal and pelvic pain presenting in forms such as dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, leucorrhoea, menstrual disorders, post-coital bleeding or simple contact bleeding (during an examination), cervicitis, endometritis and salpingitis. The disease evolves most often in a chronic manner. These genital lesions can cause complications such as early abortion, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. The clinical appearance of genital lesions is variable."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-genital-manifestations", "question": "How is it diagnosed?", "answer": "Genital schistosomiasis may be associated with the presence of schistosome eggs (ova) in the genitals in both men and women. However, ova are not always concurrently present, and current laboratory methods have a low sensitivity to confirm their presence.\r\n    Lesions associated with genital schistosomiasis may mimic a host of infections and premalignant or malignant conditions. It is therefore crucial to identify alterations that are pathognomic. Differential diagnosis must be done systematically to screen\r\n    for cancers (of the vulva, vagina, cervix, endometrium), sexually transmitted infections and urogenital tuberculosis. Clinical diagnosis of female genital schistosomiasis is mainly done by visual inspection and histological methods. The WHO Female Genital Schistosomiasis Pocket Atlas and related Clinical Poster are visual aides that have been developed for clinical health-care professionals\r\n    to raise the clinical index of suspicion and facilitate identification of these lesions, especially in low-resource settings."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-genital-manifestations", "question": "How is genital schistosomiasis treated?", "answer": "Treatment with praziquantel kills the adult worms and provides relief and regression of inflammatory lesions. Few studies reported that praziquantel has no effect on established grainy lesions. However, elimination of adult worms prevents further egg deposition in the tissues and thus development of new lesions. Early treatment, especially in childhood, is the most effective intervention to prevent the occurrence and development of complications associated with urogenital schistosomiasis. The widespread lack of awareness of genital schistosomiasis leads to misdiagnosis and, therefore, false and ineffective therapy . As female genital schistosomiasis is rarely diagnosed correctly, knowledge about the effect of treatment is also scanty. Incorrect diagnostic of genital schistosomiasis lesions frequently leads to debilitating and irreversible operations such as ovarectomy, salpingotomiy and hysterectomy. It is therefore of utmost importance to sensitize health workers and raise awareness of urogenital schistosomiasis, particularly in endemic countries."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-genital-manifestations", "question": "How can genital schistosomiasis be prevented?", "answer": "Regular treatment with praziquantel from an early age prevents schistosomiasis from progressing to genital damage and other related complications. In endemic areas, WHO recommends regular large-scale administration of preventive chemotherapy to entire communities or routinely in health facilities. The public health advantages of anthelminthic treatment with praziquantel go beyond the simple benefits of curing schistosomiasis and preventing its related genital morbidity. Regardless of the presumptive causal association with HIV infection, urogenital schistosomiasis is a disabling disease by itself, and it should be prevented with the currently available means. The WHO recommended policy of regularly treating school-age children with praziquantel should be reinforced and extended, to involve collaborations with programmes for preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "What is leishmaniasis?", "answer": "Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by any species of Leishmania parasite. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected female sandfly. In most cases, a person who is infected by the parasite has neither symptoms nor signs of infection and is not considered to have leishmaniasis. Although there are some 20 different parasites that cause the disease, there are only three different types of leishmaniasis. The most common type (CL) causes skin lesions, mainly nodules or painless ulcers. The second type (VL, also known as kala-azar) is a life-threatening disease that causes anaemia (deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells), fever, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen and significant weight loss. VL is invariably fatal if left untreated. The third type (MCL, or mucosal leishmaniasis alone) destroys the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "How are Leishmania parasites transmitted?", "answer": "Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of a tiny –2–3 mm long – female insect vector, the phlebotomine sandfly. There are some 800 known phlebotomine species, but only about 30 have been found to transmit Leishmania parasites. Only female sandflies can transmit the parasites; they need blood for their eggs to develop and become infected with Leishmania when they suck blood from an infected person or animal. Over a period of 4–25 days, the parasites develop in the sandfly. When the infectious female sandfly then feeds on a fresh source of blood, it inoculates the person or animal with the parasite, and the transmission cycle is completed. Phlebotomine sandflies are found throughout the intertropical and temperate regions of the world . The female sandfly lays its eggs in the burrows of certain rodents, the bark of old trees, ruins, cracks in the walls of houses, animal shelters and household rubbish, where the larvae can find the organic matter, heat and humidity they need to develop. In its search for blood (usually in the evening and at night), the female sandfly can cover a distance of up to several hundred metres around its habitat."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "Why is leishmaniasis important?", "answer": "The different types of leishmaniasis last months or years, causing stigmatization, stress, mutilation, weakness, prostration or eventual death if treatment is not available, depending on the causative parasite and the underlying condition of the patient. Since the disease can start as a mild, slowly progressing condition, it may take a long time before patients seek medical care or before they are diagnosed by a health practitioner who may not be familiar with the disease or where there are no appropriate health services close to where patients reside. Leishmaniasis is closely linked to poverty. Factors that increase the risk of infection include poor housing conditions and environmental sanitation, lack of personal protective measures, and economically driven migration and employment that bring nonimmune people into contact with infected sandflies. Poverty is associated with poor nutrition and other infectious diseases, which increase the risk of an infected person progressing to clinical manifestations of the disease. Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis are expensive when they are not offered free of charge in the public sector. Consequently, families must sell their assets and take loans to pay for care, leading to further impoverishment and reinforcing the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. Public investment in leishmaniasis would decrease the burden of the disease and alleviate poverty."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "How long does it take for leishmaniasis to develop after being infected?", "answer": "For VL, the incubation period (i.e. the duration between infection and the first symptom or sign) is generally 2–6 months, but it can be longer or shorter in people with compromised immune systems who visit endemic areas. For CL, the incubation period between the bite of an infected sandfly and the development of lesions may range from 2 weeks to 6 months. For PKDL, it usually appear 6 months to 1 or more years after apparent cure of VL, but it may occur earlier or concurrently with VL in certain settings."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and PKDL?", "answer": "VL, or kala-azar, is the most severe form of leishmaniasis. The main signs are prolonged irregular bouts of fever, enlarged spleen and/or loss of weight. Other signs and symptoms include anaemia, enlarged liver, cough, diarrhoea and enlarged lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, lack specificity and mimic those of malaria, malnutrition, typhoid, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and other systemic diseases. Signs of malnutrition manifest with the progression of disease, with intercurrent [1] infections. In areas co‐endemic for malaria, kala-azar should be suspected when fever lasts for 2 weeks or longer and no response has been observed with antimalarial medicines (assuming that drug‐resistant malaria has been ruled out). PKDL is characterized by patchy and raised hypopigmented rashes. It mainly occurs in areas endemic for L. donovani in East Africa and South Asia. Late manifestations are plaques, papules or nodular and infiltrative lesions, especially on the face. Most PKDL cases occur in patients previously treated for VL. The macules are often confused with vitiligo or leprosy. [1] Infection that occurs during, and modifies the course of, another disease."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis?", "answer": "CL is the most common form of leishmaniasis. The clinical spectrum is very broad and varies between and within endemic regions and depends upon several factors including parasite species or immunological status or type of zoonotic cycle involved. Classically, a typical lesion starts as a papule or nodule at the site of inoculation of the bite of the infected sandfly that grows slowly to develop a painless ulcer with surrounding induration. Lesions may not heal and require specific treatment, or spontaneously heal gradually over months or years, often resulting in a disfiguring scar with altered pigmentation. Lesions lack specificity and closely resemble many skin conditions such as cutaneous tuberculosis, fungal infection, impetigo, leprosy, psoriasis, tropical ulcer, venous leg ulcers, verruca or zona. MCL lesions can lead to partial or total destruction of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. Some patients have mucosal lesions without cutaneous involvement."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "How is leishmaniasis diagnosed?", "answer": "The different forms of leishmaniasis can be diagnosed by various methods depending upon the type of health facility and the health care setting. These methods include serological tests or microscopic demonstration of parasites, culture or PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Parasite identification remains the gold standard of diagnosis. In areas endemic for VL, the disease can be diagnosed at primary health care level or in rural district hospitals using the rK39-based rapid diagnostic test, which produces results in less than 30 minutes. For PKDL, diagnosis is generally clinical and can be confirmed by skin smears or skin biopsies. CL is usually diagnosed clinically in highly endemic areas where only one type of infection exists. It is mandatory to obtain a parasitological confirmation of the diagnosis before engaging in a systemic, potentially highly toxic antileishmanial treatment. The same procedure is recommended before engaging in a local treatment."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "What is the treatment against leishmaniasis?", "answer": "The various clinical forms of leishmaniasis are either life‐threatening (if untreated) or disfiguring in a proportion of patients. Therefore, confirmation of disease is important before initiating treatment. Several factors determine the choice of therapy, such as clinical form of leishmaniasis, parasite species, endemic region, health service setting, drug policy in endemic countries, availability of antileishmanial medicines, other morbid conditions and individual benefit–risk ratio of medicines. In certain cases, supportive treatment such as nutritional supplementation or rehydration blood transfusion may be required before starting therapy. Wherever possible, cases should be managed under medical supervision. VL is a life-threatening condition, and the aim of the treatment is to cure the patient, reduce the risk of relapse and reduce transmission of resistant parasites. Similarly, for CL, therapeutic interventions include a range of options such as topical, systemic and nonpharmacological treatments."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "Why are the number of cases reported lower than the number of cases estimated?", "answer": "Underreporting of leishmaniasis varies from country to country and among regions. Several factors have an impact on the accuracy of official data versus the actual burden of disease. Patients who are affected by minor or mild forms of the disease, such as some types of small self-healing lesions, do not seek medical attention. In other circumstances, the long distances between the place of residence and the health facility, or the lack of adequate equipment in some health facilities to diagnose or treat the disease, prevent patients from seeking medical attention. Frequently, surveillance systems in many countries are not configured to capture neglected tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis or the system does not perform well."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "What can I do to prevent infection?", "answer": "The only way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by an infected female sandfly carrying the parasite. Practically, this can be difficult in real field conditions. Although there are a number of measures that could minimize the chances of being bitten, such as sleeping under an impregnated bed net or spraying the walls of houses, not all sandflies have the same resting and biting habits, and these vector behaviours pose a challenge to effective prevention. Some sandflies are indoors while others are outdoors, and their biting preferences for humans or other mammals affect the chances of being bitten in a given geographical area. There is no vaccination or preventive medicine against the disease."}
{"topic": "/leishmaniasis", "question": "What are the control strategies for leishmaniasis?", "answer": "Control of leishmaniasis depends on several factors, including local epidemiology of disease, geographical areas, transmission habitats, knowledge of parasite and vector species involved, presence or absence of animal reservoirs, ecology of the area, presence of other vector-borne diseases and social contexts, for example population displacement, rapid urbanization and deforestation. Generally, control strategies include early detection and treatment of cases, control of reservoir hosts, vector control, environmental management and improvement in social determinants of risk factors."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-authorities", "question": "How should imported foods from countries with high prevalence of COVID-19 be treated?", "answer": "As food has not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19, imported food should be subjected to the same import controls as before the pandemic. See FAO guidance on risk based imported food control ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-authorities", "question": "Do food inspectors need to wear any protective equipment?", "answer": "In the course of conducting a food inspection, food inspectors routinely wear protective equipment. There is no need for additional protective equipment to be used. The primary focus of the additional hygiene and sanitation measures implemented by food businesses should be on keeping the COVID-19 out of their businesses. COVID-19 virus will only enter business premises when an infected person enters, or contaminated fomites are brought into the premises. Food safety authorities should consider reducing the frequency of food inspections during this pandemic. If food inspectors continue to carry out food inspections, they will need to demonstrate that they are free from infection, they will need to practice physical distancing while in the food premises, changing clothes/shoes between inspections, washing hands before and after entering the food premises and good coughing/sneezing etiquette."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-authorities", "question": "What do food inspectors need to consider when reopening a food business when the pandemic is over?", "answer": "Food inspectors do not need to intervene when restaurants reopen after having closed upon the advice of national governments."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-authorities", "question": "What are the lab protocols for identifying the virus in food? On surfaces?", "answer": "As food has not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19, testing of food or food surfaces for this virus is not recommended. Frequent cleaning of food contact surfaces with virucidal disinfectants such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) or products based on ethanol (at least 70%) should be carried out. Alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS)."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-authorities", "question": "Is quarantine necessary for live animals imported from countries experiencing a large numbers of COVID-19 cases?", "answer": "No, food animals have not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19 and the same import controls should apply as before this pandemic. See Q&A from the World Organisation for Animal Health for more about COVID-19 and animals."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-safety-authorities", "question": "How do we ensure the food supply chain remains intact to prevent food shortages?", "answer": "While many businesses have introduced working from home and teleworking, these are not options for food workers who are required to continue to work as normal. Keeping all workers in the food production and supply chains healthy and safe is critical to avoid food shortage. Maintaining the movement of food along the food chain is an essential function of all sectors of the food industry and is extremely important for ensuring consumer confidence in the food supply. In order to ensure that the food supply chain remains intact to prevent food shortages there is an urgent requirement for the industry to introduce additional measures to protect food workers from contracting COVID-19; to prevent the risk of exposure to COVID-19, and to strengthen existing food hygiene and sanitation practices."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "How can food businesses remain safe from virus contamination?", "answer": "The main priority is to keep the virus out of the food environment. Several key measures are required including upgrading of cleaning and sanitation measures, disinfecting surfaces and high-touch points, educating staff on the virus and how to protect themselves and others, reinforcing protocols such as physical distancing, hand washing, and improved security with people staying in their vehicles/sanitizing hands when handing out documents and other material."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "Should grocery store workers wear gloves? Masks?", "answer": "Disposable Gloves Gloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves. Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required. Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing. Hand sanitisers can be used as an additional measure but should not replace hand washing. Wearing of Face Masks WHO advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 should be followed. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice. WHO recommends that face masks should be used if a person is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or looking after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. However, a food worker who is sick or who has symptoms of COVID-19 should not be allowed to work in grocery stores or other food businesses and should be excluded from work until free of symptoms or deemed fit for work by a medical doctor."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "What is the protocol when an employee working in a food business becomes ill with COVID-19?", "answer": "Staff who are feeling unwell should not report to work and should seek medical advice. However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people.\r\n    If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the\r\n    food premise. The employee who is unwell should follow national guidelines for reporting cases/suspect cases of COVID-19. Whilst they wait for medical advice or to be sent home, they should avoid any contact with other employees. They should avoid touching people,\r\n    surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do not have any tissues available, they should\r\n    cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical assistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been\r\n    shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties.\r\n    All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to notify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take measures to minimise further risk of spread. WHO definitions of a contact of a COVID-19 case can be found here . Examples of contacts in the food businesses could include any employee who was in face-to-face or physical (i.e., touching) contact; any employee who was within 1 meter with the confirmed case; anyone who has cleaned up any bodily fluids\r\n        without adequate PPE (e.g. gloves, overalls, protective clothing); employees in the same working team or workgroup as the confirmed case, and any employee living in the same household as a confirmed case. WHO recommends that contacts be quarantined for 14 days from the last point of exposure to the confirmed case.22 At a minimum, staff who have had\r\n    close contact with the infected employee should be asked to stay at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the confirmed case and practice physical distancing. If they become unwell at any time within their 14-day isolation period\r\n    and they test positive for COVID-19, they will become a confirmed case, and should be managed as such. Staff who have not had close contact with the original confirmed case should continue taking the usual precautions and attend work as usual. Organising employees into small teams or workgroups will help to minimise disruption to work processes in the event of an employee reporting sick with symptoms of COVID-19. Closure of the workplace is not recommended. More detailed information can be found in COVID-19 and food safety: guidance for food businesses . For more information on contacts of COVID-19 confirmed cases, see WHO guidance on surveillance and case definitions ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "When can an employee return to work following illness? Are temperature checks appropriate?", "answer": "A return to work policy for staff who have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 should be in place. WHO recommends that a confirmed patient could be released from isolation once their symptoms resolve and they have two negative PCR tests at least 24 hours apart.  If testing is not possible, WHO recommends that a confirmed patient can be released from isolation 14 days after symptoms resolve. Taking the temperature of food workers is not recommended. Fever is only one of the symptoms of COVID-19 and absence of fever alone is not a reliable indicator of wellness. As part of a food business ‘fitness to work’ guidelines, staff should report to management if they are sick with typical COVID-19 symptoms, particularly fever."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "What specific precautions do food workers need to take?", "answer": "Physical distancing, good personal hygiene with frequent hand washing, and application of general food hygiene measures are the most important precautions food workers should adopt. Physical distancing is very important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. This is achieved by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals. Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. All food businesses should follow the physical distancing and hand washing guidance of WHO . The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene ( Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene , CXC 1- 1969 ), handle meats ( Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat , CXC 58 – 2005 ), and control viruses in foods ( Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012 ). Enhanced food safety practices at this time, such as those recommended in the Codex documents mentioned, will reduce the likelihood of contamination of foods with any pathogen and help lowering the public health burden caused by already established foodborne infections, reducing the stress on an already overburdened public health system."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "How should employees maintain safe distance from one another during food production and processing?", "answer": "WHO guidelines are to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) between fellow workers. Where the food production environment makes it difficult to do so, employers need to consider what measures to put in place to protect employees. Examples of practical measures to adhere to physical distancing guidance in the food processing environment are to: stagger workstations on either side of processing lines so that food workers are not facing one another, provide personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, clean overalls and slip reduction work shoes for staff. The use of PPE would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. When staff are dressed in PPE it is possible to reduce distance between workers, space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines, limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time, organise staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "How should baked goods and fresh produce be displayed in a food market/grocery store?", "answer": "It is important to maintain good hygiene practices around open food displays, with ready-to-eat food products such as salad bars, fresh produce displays and bakery products. Consumers should always be advised to wash fruits and vegetables with potable water prior to consumption. Both customers and staff should strictly observe good personal hygiene practices at all times around open food areas. In order to hygienically manage open food displays and to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, food retailers should: Maintain frequent washing and sanitising of all food contact surfaces and utensils; Require food service workers to frequently wash hands, and, if using gloves, these must be changed; Require food service workers to frequently clean and sanitise counters, serving utensils and condiment containers; Make available hand sanitiser for consumers on their way in and out of the food premises; Should consider not openly displaying or selling unwrapped bakery products from self-service counters. Bakery products on open, self-service displays in retail stores should be placed in plastic/cellophane or paper packaging. Where loose bakery products are displayed in retail stores, these should be placed in plexiglass display cabinets and placed in bags using tongs when customers are served. Ready-to-eat salads available in retail for self-serve, should also be placed behind plexiglass display cabinets and serving utensils should be frequently sanitized."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "How should shopping trolleys or carts be disinfected?", "answer": "The handles of shopping trolleys or carts should be frequently cleaned using either alcohol-based sanitizers or chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite). Sanitizers, paper towels and trash bins should be placed outside the retail premises close to the trolley park for customers to use."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "What is the most appropriate sanitizer to use on surfaces in a food production environment?", "answer": "In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS)."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "Could the virus be transmitted from humans to food animals or vice versa?", "answer": "Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that food animals could be a possible route for transmission of COVID-19 to humans or that food animals can become infected by humans. Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the COVID-19 virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. Additional information can be found on the website of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "What is known about various conditions affecting survivability of the virus?", "answer": "Very little is known about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives outside the human body. Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Centre for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recent technical report : Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self-service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6]. This evidence shows the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of a COVID-19 patient, therefore reinforcing the belief that fomites play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the relative importance of this route of transmission compared to direct exposure to respiratory droplets is still unclear."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "What measures should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic?", "answer": "The general guidelines outlined in the Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for the Transport of Food in Bulk and Semi-Packed Food . 1 should be followed, in addition to ensuring that employees delivering foods are free from COVID-19, coughing/sneezing etiquette is practiced by all involved in food transport and that frequent hand washing/sanitizing is practiced and staff practice physical distancing. See also other Codes of Hygienic Practice for various groups of food ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "What measures should be taken to ensure safe water is used in food production during this pandemic?", "answer": "There is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted by water used in food processing. The WHO guidelines for drinking-water quality should be followed."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-food-businesses", "question": "How should food premises be cleaned/disinfected during this pandemic?", "answer": "The general guidelines outlined in the General Principles of Food Hygiene for food processing and manufacture premises should be followed. If a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a food premises then there is a requirement to completely clean the area with a neutral detergent, followed by decontamination of surfaces using a disinfectant effective against viruses. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS). All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when performing cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use plastic aprons, gloves and a face mask. Protective clothing (e.g. uniforms, overalls, etc.) should be frequently washed at 60°C or above."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "What is COVID-19?", "answer": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus, which has not been previously identified in humans. In most cases, COVID-19 causes mild symptoms including dry cough, tiredness and fever, though fever may not be a symptom for some older people. Other mild symptoms include aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "How is COVID-19 transmitted?", "answer": "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "Who is at risk of developing severe disease?", "answer": "Older people, and people of all ages with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, or cancer) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?", "answer": "While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon as research results become available."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "What can I do to prevent infection?", "answer": "To prevent infection, there are a five things that you can do. 1. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly. You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. You can learn how to wash your hands in this video (or this visual ). If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin. 2. Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing . And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes. 3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. 4. Keep physical distance from others. If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home. 5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day . This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Learn more by clicking here ."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "What can older people do to prepare for COVID-19 in their community?", "answer": "There is a lot that you can do to prepare for COVID-19 in your community. Inform yourself of the special measures taken in your community as well as the services and the sources of reliable information that are availableduring the health emergency  (e.g. home deliveries, psychosocial support, health ministry website, alternative access to your pension). Create a list of the basic supplies that you will need for at least two weeks and try to get these delivered where possible (e.g. non-perishable food items, household products, batteries for assistive\r\n            devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively, ask family members, caregivers, neighbours or community leaders to help with ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that your mobile phone\r\n            credit is topped up and identify a safe place to charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and friends and reach emergency services if needed. Make a list of emergency numbers (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers, hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts (e.g. family members\r\n            and friends, main caregiver, community care worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share this list and ask your neighbours, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly, for example, by phone or video chat. Discuss with your health-care worker how your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone or video chat instead\r\n            of in person and/or revising your vaccination schedule. If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver , identify with him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide\r\n            care. Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that they can be ready to provide care in case of need. If you are the primary caregiver of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick .\r\n Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations in your community might be able to help. If multiple people live in your home, if possible prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not have space for self-isolation,\r\n            contact your community leaders or local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help you or other household members self-isolate. Think about what matters most to you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to develop an advanced care plan to record\r\n            your treatment and care wishes, you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust. You can write down your wishes and  share them with people you trust."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-risks-and-safety-for-older-people", "question": "How can I keep healthy on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "You can follow these 10 steps to keep healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Keep to your regular routines as much as possible and maintain a daily schedule for yourself including sleeping, meals and activities. Stay socially connected . Speak to loved ones and people you trust every day or as much as possible, using the telephone, video-calls or messaging, through writing letters, etc. Use this time to share your feelings and to do common\r\n        hobbies together. Be physically active every day . Reduce long periods of sitting and set up a daily routine that includes at least 30 minutes of exercise. Make sure to do activities that are safe and appropriate for your level of physical fitness as\r\n        indicated by your health-care worker. You can use household chores as a way to keep physically active, follow an on-line class (e.g. Tai Chi, yoga) or choose your favourite music and dance to that. Drink water and eat healthy and well-balanced meals . This will keep you hydrated, help strengthen your immune system and lower the risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. For nutrition advice click here . Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol . Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking can affect lung capacity and because the act of smoking increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand\r\n        to mouth. Drinking alcohol not only disturbs your sleep but may also increase your risk of falls, weaken your immune system, and interact with any prescription medicines that you are taking. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink or don’t\r\n        drink alcohol at all. Take breaks from news coverage about COVID-19 as prolonged exposure can cause feelings of anxiety and despair. Seek updates at specific times of the day from a reliable source like the WHO website (click here) or national or local channels in order to help you distinguish facts from rumours or scams. Engage in hobbies and activities that you enjoy or learn something new . Cognitive exercise such as reading a book or doing crosswords/Sudoku will keep your mind active and distract you from worrying. You can also use this time to\r\n        keep a well-being diary ( click here for an example. ) If you have ongoing health conditions , take your prescribed medicines and follow the advice of your health-care worker regarding any health visits or phone consultations. If you have an emergency medical condition that is not related to COVID-19 , contact health emergencies immediately and ask what you should do next. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker. If stress, worry, fear or sadness get in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row, seek psychosocial support from available services in your community.  If you are subject to abuse or violence from\r\n        others, tell someone you trust and report this to the relevant authorities. You can also seek support from dedicated helplines that may be available in your country."}

What advice do you have to help me cope?", "answer": "Losing someone close to you is always hard, whatever the cause. During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help. Do not criticise yourself for how you feel . When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions.  You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normal\r\n        and there is no right or wrong way to feel grief. Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss . You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time. Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings. Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy. Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass) . Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one.

There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "In communities where COVID-19 is prevalent, should mothers breastfeed?", "answer": "Yes. In all socio-economic settings, breastfeeding improves survival and provides lifelong health and development advantages to newborns and infants. Breastfeeding also improves the health of mothers."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "Following delivery, should a baby still be immediately placed skin-to-skin and breastfed if the mother is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19?", "answer": "Yes. Immediate and continued skin-to-skin care, including kangaroo mother care, improves the temperature control of newborns and is associated with improved survival among newborn babies. Placing the newborn close to the mother also enables early initiation of breastfeeding which also reduces mortality. The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "Can women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 breastfeed?", "answer": "Yes. Women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should: Wash hands frequently with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub and especially before touching the baby; Wear a medical mask during any contact with the baby, including while feeding; Sneeze or cough into a tissue. Then dispose of it immediately and wash hands again; Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces that mothers have touched. It is important to replace medical masks as soon as they become damp and dispose of them immediately. Masks should not be reused or touched in the front."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "If a mother confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 does not have a medical face mask should she still breastfeed?", "answer": "Yes. Breastfeeding unquestionably reduces mortality in newborns and infants and provides numerous lifelong health and brain development advantages to the child. Mothers with symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to wear a medical mask, but even if this is not possible, breastfeeding should be continued. Mothers should follow other infection prevention measures, such as washing hands, cleaning surfaces, sneezing or\r\n    coughing into a tissue. Non-medical masks (e.g. home-made or cloth masks) have not been evaluated. At this time, it is not possible to make a recommendation for or against their use."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and am too unwell to breastfeed my baby directly. What can I do?", "answer": "If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby due to COVID-19 or other complications, you should be supported to safely provide your baby with breast milk in a way possible, available, and acceptable to you. This could include: Expressing milk; Donor human milk. If expressing breast milk or donor human milk are not feasible then consider wet nursing (another woman breastfeeds the child) or infant formula milk with measures to ensure that it is feasible, correctly prepared, safe and sustainable."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "I had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and was unable to breastfeed, when can I start to breastfeed again?", "answer": "You can start to breastfeed when you feel well enough to do so. There is no fixed time interval to wait after confirmed or suspected COVID-19. There is no evidence that breastfeeding changes the clinical course of COVID-19 in a mother. Health workers or breastfeeding counsellors should support you to relactate."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19, is it safer to give my baby infant formula milk?", "answer": "No. There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings. The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised, such as reduced access\r\nto health services if a baby becomes unwell, reduced access to clean water and/or access to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, affordable and sustainable. The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with the COVID-19 virus."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-breastfeeding", "question": "Can a breastfeeding woman get vaccinated against COVID-19?", "answer": "Yes, women who are breastfeeding can take the vaccine when it becomes available to them. None of the currently approved vaccines use the live virus, so there is no risk of passing the virus to the baby through breastmilk. There is also some evidence that, after vaccination, antibodies are found in breastmilk, which may help protect the baby against COVID-19."}

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change", "question": "Do weather and climate determine where COVID-19 occurs?", "answer": "No. There is currently no conclusive evidence that either weather (short term variations in meteorological conditions) or climate (long-term averages) have a strong influence on transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 disease has been transmitted in all regions of the world, from cold and dry, to hot and humid climates. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted directly from person-to-person through close contact, or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People may be infected by touching exposed surfaces, but this is not thought to be a major transmission route. While temperature and humidity may influence how long the virus survives outside of the human body, this effect is likely to be small compared to the degree of contact between people. Physical distancing and washing hands are therefore essential to breaking the chain of transmission, and are the most effective way to protect yourself, in all locations and all seasons of the year."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change", "question": "Will climate change make COVID-19 worse?", "answer": "There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease. As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients. However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in wildlife, and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of biodiversity and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change", "question": "Have measures to contain COVID-19 reduced air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases?", "answer": "Air pollution is a serious health risk. It kills approximately 7 million people every year and is responsible for one third of all deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Over 90% of the global population lives in places where the WHO outdoor air quality guideline levels are not met, and about two-thirds of this exposure is caused by burning of fossil fuels, which also drives climate change. Efforts to control COVID-19 transmission have reduced economic activity and led to temporary improvements in air quality in some areas. In contrast, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that drive climate change persist for a long time in the atmosphere, temporary emissions reductions only have a limited effect on atmospheric concentrations. Carbon dioxide levels at observing stations around the world in the first months of 2020 have been higher than in 2019. Environmental improvements resulting from the COVID-19 response may be reversed by a rapid expansion of polluting economic activities once the measures have ended, unless there is a clear focus to promote equity, environmental health, around a just transition to a green economy. Any short-term environmental benefits as a result of COVID-19 come at an unacceptable human and economic cost, and are no substitute for planned and sustained action on air quality and climate."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change", "question": "How does water scarcity affect infectious diseases like COVID-19?", "answer": "Access to adequate and safe water and sanitation is essential for communities to practice basic hygiene and reduce transmission of COVID-19. Access to these services in health facilities is crucial to preventing infections, reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and providing quality care. One in four health care facilities around the world lacks basic water services, directly impacting over two billion people. Around 80% of the world’s population is already experiencing some level of water scarcity. Climate change further threatens the availability of water for consumption, food production, personal hygiene, and medical care, including for infectious disease."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change", "question": "What can the global response to COVID-19 teach us about our response to climate change?", "answer": "The COVID-19 pandemic is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which has claimed lives, and severely disrupted communities. Climate change is a gradually increasing stress that may be the defining public health threat of the 21 st century. Nonetheless, common lessons can be drawn: Ensuring universal health coverage ( UHC ), through well-resourced, equitable health systems, is essential to protect the public from both short and long-term health threats. Guaranteeing global health security requires an all-hazards approach to preparedness, from infectious disease outbreaks, to extreme weather events, to climate change. Ensuring access to the environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, water and sanitation, safe and nutritious food, is an essential protection against all health risks. WHO estimates that avoidable environmental risks cause about a quarter of the global health burden. Early action saves lives. Delay in responding to clear evidence of threats, whether from pandemics, or from climate change, increases human and socioeconomic costs. Inequality is a major barrier in ensuring health and wellbeing, especially for the most vulnerable in society. Social and economic inequality manifests in unequal health risks. When faced with public health threats of a global scale, such as COVID-19 or climate change, we are only as strong as our weakest health system."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting", "question": "Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19?", "answer": "Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have\r\nbeen included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current\r\nscenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care\r\nresource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that\r\napply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to\r\ndifferent decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to\r\nsignificantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are\r\nrelevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it\r\nmay be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that\r\ndeprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to\r\nwhich resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, for\r\ninstance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example,\r\nventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce,\r\nthough – when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocation\r\nshould be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there are\r\ncharacteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevant\r\ncharacteristics of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should play\r\nno role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment to treating\r\npeople with equal respect."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting", "question": "Are the ethical considerations the same for all medical countermeasures, including therapeutics, vaccines and personal protective equipment (PPE)?", "answer": "Generally, the considerations may be different. The allocation of different resources may find\r\nethical justifications in different principles or values. For instance, once a novel vaccine is\r\nfound to be safe and effective, to prioritize those at highest risk, as well as populations like\r\nhealth care workers who may be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified. Within those subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may be\r\njustified, given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits will be\r\nderived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however, for other\r\nresources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly more benefit\r\nthan others."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting", "question": "What is the basis for deciding who should have priority access to scarce resources?", "answer": "The ethical basis for deciding which individuals or groups might be prioritized, including the principles to be applied, are presented in the below table: Ethical considerations when deciding who to prioritize Principle Description Practice implication Equality Each person’s interest should count equally unless there are good reasons that justify the differential prioritization of resources. Irrelevant characteristics of individuals, such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not serve arbitrarily as the basis for the differential allocation of resources. This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery – that is, randomly by chance – or by a system of first come, first served. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals or populations who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource, for example, vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among\r\n                    those with similar clinical indicators for benefit. Best outcomes (utility) This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity to do the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available resources to save the most lives possible. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources that confer substantially different benefits to different individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected to derive the most benefit. Prioritize the worst off This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those in greatest medical need or those most at risk. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources that are designed or intended to protect those at risk, for example, PPE for health care workers, vaccines for those most at risk of infection and severe illness, or those most\r\n                    in need, as in the case of provision of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently. Prioritize those tasked with helping others This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation in helping others. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources to health care workers, first responders, etc. Allocation principles may be relevant or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of resources such as ventilators may be most justified by the\r\n    principle of first come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity,\r\n    a principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified. At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality – that is, first come, first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individuals\r\n    within a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar needs, or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources, or among those that are at similar levels of risk). In addition, multiple principles may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helping\r\n    others, which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting", "question": "How should decision-makers make considered ethical judgements about these matters, given the likelihood that there will not be enough of a resource? Who should be involved in decision-making on scarce resources?", "answer": "For most decisions, multiple ethical values and principles will be relevant to deliberations\r\nabout how to allocate resources. This is likely to generate some disagreement, because\r\ndifferent people may weigh the values differently. Some may prioritize equality while others\r\nmight put more emphasis on best outcomes or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason,\r\nit is imperative that the different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues\r\nusing a fair process. A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical values: Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should\r\nbe made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria\r\nguiding the decisions. Inclusiveness. Those affected by allocation decisions – including individuals,\r\ncommunities or countries – should be able to exert at least some influence over the\r\ndecision-making process as well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions \r\n4\r\nshould be open to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appeal\r\nprocess. Consistency. Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categories\r\nare treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one’s own family,\r\nreligious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of\r\ncorruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and\r\ncondemned. Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for\r\nthose decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for\r\nthem. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by\r\nindividuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation\r\nbetween countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies\r\nshould not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation. The fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because it is fair.\r\nHowever, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders solidarity and trust,\r\nwhich are vital to the successful and sustained collective response necessary for dealing\r\neffectively with any outbreak."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting", "question": "What are the key ethical considerations that governments, vaccine manufacturers and funders should take into account to ensure a fair distribution of vaccines globally?", "answer": "Countries are equally vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a shared responsibility, grounded in solidarity, to collaborate globally to mitigate the outbreak. Each government has special obligations to its own citizens, but the fair allocation of vaccines globally\r\n    requires us not to simply appeal to self-interest, claims of resource ownership and the prioritization of compatriots. Vaccines should be allocated in a way that prioritizes those who fall into the categories presented in the below table. (Where individuals\r\n    or populations fall into multiple categories, they should receive even higher priority.) Priority populations, and rationale for prioritization Priority population Rationale for prioritization Those at greatest risk of becoming infected and seriously ill Maximize benefit of vaccine Those who, if vaccinated, would prevent the greatest spread of the virus Maximize benefit of vaccine Those who have volunteered to participate in research aimed at developing the vaccine Reciprocal obligation to those who were voluntarily put at risk to aid in this effort Those falling into each category may change over time."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-ethics-resource-allocation-and-priority-setting", "question": "What conclusions can we draw about the fair allocation of scarce resources within countries during the COVID-19 outbreak?", "answer": "Health care workers (caring for patients) and first responders can justifiably be\r\nprioritized when allocating some resources because of their contribution to the health\r\nand well-being of the community. Their health helps preserve the health of others. Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical\r\nresources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have\r\nalso helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority – for\r\nexample, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the\r\ncase of resources such as vaccines. While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating\r\nresources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice,\r\nit is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre,\r\nthose with access to better information, or those who are most well-off. Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context.\r\nConsequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, but\r\nperhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care\r\nresources. The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different\r\nprinciples or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective,\r\na lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old and\r\nthose with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines. Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off:\r\ncentralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits to\r\nmore people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for\r\nthose at highest risk."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "What is schistosomiasis or bilharzia?", "answer": "Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms. It is transmitted when larval forms released by freshwater snails penetrate human skin during contact with infested water."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "In which regions is the disease mostly found?", "answer": "Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It is more prevalent in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is estimated that at least 90% of those requiring treatment for schistosomiasis live in Africa."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "How does one get infected?", "answer": "Bilharzia is transmitted when people suffering from schistosomiasis contaminate freshwater sources with their excreta containing parasite eggs, which hatch in water. In the body, the larvae develop into adult worms. These worms live in the blood vessels where the females release eggs. Some of the eggs are passed out of the body in the faeces or urine to continue the parasite’s life cycle. Others become trapped in body tissues, causing immune reactions and progressive damage to organs."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "What are the forms of the disease?", "answer": "There are two major forms of schistosomiasis: intestinal and urogenital. Both forms affect mainly poor and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing populations."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "What are the symptoms of intestinal schistosomiasis?", "answer": "Intestinal schistosomiasis can cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "What are the symptoms of urogenital schistosomiasis?", "answer": "The classic sign is presence of blood in urine (haematuria). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "Is the disease more complicated in women?", "answer": "Women doing domestic chores in infested water, such as washing clothes in areas endemic for the disease, are greatly at risk. Women can also develop female genital schistosomiasis – which can cause genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. Female genital schistosomiasis is also considered to be a risk factor for HIV infection, especially in women."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "How do children get exposed and how can the disease affect them?", "answer": "Lack of hygiene and certain play habits of school-aged children such as swimming or fishing in infested water make them especially vulnerable to infection. Schistosomiasis can also cause anaemia and stunting and a reduced ability to learn among children."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "Can schistosomiasis be treated?", "answer": "All forms of schistosomiasis can be treated effectively by the WHO-recommended medicine praziquantel. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and repeated in childhood. As part of its global strategy to control the disease, WHO focuses on reducing the disease through periodic, targeted treatment with praziquantel through the large-scale treatment (preventive chemotherapy) of affected populations. This involves regular treatment of all at-risk groups."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "Can pregnant women be treated with praziquantel?", "answer": "Praziquantel is extremely safe and WHO recommends that pregnant women infected with the disease should be treated. But as a general precaution, WHO recommends treatment should be taken after the first trimester."}
{"topic": "/schistosomiasis-(bilharzia)", "question": "Should tourists be concerned when traveling to countries that have schistosomiasis?", "answer": "Tourists can easily avoid infection\r\nby not swimming in fresh water in areas where schistosomiasis is likely to\r\noccur. Even if infected, the worms do not cause a life-threatening disease for\r\nsomeone who is generally healthy. The disease is only serious for people living\r\nin endemic areas who become constantly re-infected and have no access\r\ntreatment. If infected, treatment with praziquantel is easy, efficacious and\r\nsafe."}
{"topic": "/the-triple-billion-targets", "question": "Q. What are the Triple Billion targets?", "answer": "The Triple Billion targets are an ambitious initiative to improve the health of billions by 2023. As the foundation of WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13), the Triple Billions function both as a measurement and a policy strategy. They are an integral part of the GPW13’s Results Framework, a new tool designed to measure and improve WHO’s impact on health at the country level. Additionally, measurement of these targets has been consciously aligned with those of the SDGs, to reduce country burden in data collection and streamline efforts to accelerate progress towards achieving key targets. Finally, the Triple Billions will focus on the execution and delivery of significant improvements in the health of the world’s population through evidence-based interventions, strengthened health information systems, and support for transformational public health policy."}
{"topic": "/the-triple-billion-targets", "question": "Q. What are the objectives of the Triple Billion targets?", "answer": "The goals of the Triple Billions are simple and straightforward. By 2023, WHO proposes to achieve: 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being. However, the Triple Billions have implications beyond these three targets. Measuring the Triple Billions highlights the considerable gaps in public health data that exist in many parts of the world. Therefore, strengthening data collection and monitoring across all levels will be key to achieving both the Triple Billions and SDGs, and will have long-term implications for improving the health of the world."}
{"topic": "/the-triple-billion-targets", "question": "Q. How are the Triple Billion targets calculated?", "answer": "Each of the Triple Billions will be assessed at the population level, and are designed to count lives that benefit from direct intervention. The choice of methods used to calculate the Triple Billions follows extensive debate and consultation with experts from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds and has been documented as the GPW13 Methods Report . The resulting estimates will be best approximations given multiple variables, including the definition of the Triple Billions, limitations of indicator data availability and quality, and variations in country and regional contexts. Additionally, the design of the targets and their methods is such that countries can independently calculate their contributions to each of the Triple Billions, helping inform their own target-setting for national health priorities."}
{"topic": "/the-triple-billion-targets", "question": "Q. What are the limitations of the Triple Billion methods?", "answer": "The Triple Billions are inherently broadly defined and they are linked to the GPW13 programme and its indicators. They are primarily based on SDG data, which WHO has committed to using for minimizing any additional burden of data collection, and to reinforce progress towards those global aims. Additionally, the accuracy of calculating the Triple Billions is constrained by large data gaps, disparate sources and quality of data, and delays in availability of the data for the calculations. Additionally, in many instances the indicators being used are proxies and not an exact measure. For example, the use of prevalence of raised blood pressure as a proxy for hypertension treatment as part of the UHC Billion. In other cases, important health indicators relevant to the Triple Billions were not defined at the time of the SDGs and so those indicators are missing (e.g. cancer screening and treatment, treatment of mental disorders, and physical inactivity). Despite these limitations, the Triple Billions provide an important mechanism to measure progress, and it is through the monitoring and use of this data that we will see accelerated improvements to the health of citizens."}

What can I do?", "answer": "If you are experiencing violence, it may be helpful to reach out to family, friends and neighbors, to seek support from a hotline or, if safe, from online service for survivors of violence. Find out if local services (e.g. shelters, counselling) are open and reach out to them if available. Make a safety plan in case the violence against you or your children escalates. This includes: Identifying a neighbour, friend, relative, colleague, or shelter to go to in case you need to leave the house immediately for safety. Have a plan for how you will exit the house safely and how you will reach there (e.g. transport). Keep a few essential items (e.g. identification documents, phone, money, medicines, and clothes) available, and a list of telephone numbers in case of an emergency.

Is there anyone who can help me during COVID-19?", "answer": "As much as possible, reduce sources of stress: Maintain contact with and seek support from family and friends via phone, email, text, etc. Try to maintain daily routines and make time for physical activity and sleep. Use relaxation exercises (e.g. slow breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, grounding exercises – see WHO Clinical handbook p.70 ) to relieve stressful thoughts and feelings. Engage in activities that in the past have helped with managing adversity. Seek information about COVID- 19 from reliable sources and reduce the time spent consuming news (for example, 1-2 times per day, rather than every hour). Seek care from a trained health provider for symptoms and conditions including injuries that need medical attention. Due to restrictions on movement, and pressure on health systems, it may be difficult to access healthcare in person at this time. In this case, find out what is available in your locality and seek alternatives, including information and support offered by phone or online.

Assume that a perpetrator of violence can see, hear and or monitor communications, so find out how best to communicate with the person that you are concerned about.  Send them an SMS or message via email or social media, in a way that is safe for them. Be discrete in connecting with them when the abuser is present in the home so that they are not placed at risk of additional harm. Check each time, as this may change. Find out what services for survivors of violence against women (e.g. shelters, hotlines, counselling services, women’s organizations) are functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic and make this information available through your networks and social media. Only provide this information directly if you can do so discretely without the abuser finding out.

{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-violence-against-women", "question": "I am a health worker. How can I help women survivors of violence during COVID-19?", "answer": "As a health worker, there are things you can do to help mitigate the impacts of violence on women and children at any time, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst your time and resources may be stretched during this health emergency, you have a duty of care to women who may seek help from you – often to address physical and mental hurt caused by violence. You may need to adjust how you deliver services, if face-to-face care is not possible. Depending on your resources consider mobile phone, WhatsApp or other communication channels to deliver support, always ensuring you can do this in a way that is safe for the survivor. Communicate openly with women about any changes in service delivery. If a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 seeks your care because of violence, your response should be the same as for any other survivor. You should however ensure that you are protected from infection, by maintaining distance where possible, wearing protective clothing, practicing respiratory hygiene, and washing hands and surfaces with soap and water regularly and after touching, to avoid infection. In any circumstances, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should provide first-line support, using the LIVES approach to help women survivors of violence: L isten closely, with empathy and no judgement I nquire about women’s needs and concerns V alidate women’s experiences.

Find out opening hours, contact details and whether these services can be offered remotely, and establish referral linkages. Make these available to health care providers and easily accessible to patients/clients coming to your facility. Support the health care providers in your facility to continue to support women survivors of violence during this time. Be prepared to shift rapidly to providing care through alternative ways, by creating effective response plans; for example, by ensuring frontline healthcare workers have phones and can charge them.

Allocate adequate resources for services for survivors and identify ways to make them accessible – particularly in the context of measures to restrict people’s movement. Explore the use of telemedicine, digital health, or mhealth to enhance access to support and services for survivors, while ensuring this is safe for them. Explore alternative shelters for women who may require this. Ensure that lockdown measures do not penalize women for seeking support when experiencing violence, such as by going to the police or hospital to report violence."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-violence-against-women", "question": "Has violence against women increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic?", "answer": "Violence against women is highly prevalent, and intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. During health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, violence against women tends to increase. Whilst data are scarce, reports from across the world, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries suggest a significant increase in domestic violence cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports from other countries suggest a reduction in survivors seeking services due to a combination of lockdown measures and not wanting to attend health services for fear of infection."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-violence-against-women", "question": "How does COVID-19 increase risks of violence for women?", "answer": "Stress, the disruption of social and protective networks, loss of income and decreased access to services all can exacerbate the risk of violence for women. In many countries, where people are encouraged or required to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase. In addition, access to sexual and reproductive health services will likely become more limited. Other services, such as hotlines, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services, may also be reduced, making it difficult for women to access the few sources of help that would usually be available."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-violence-against-women", "question": "Who is most vulnerable?", "answer": "Women who are displaced, who are migrants or refugees, and those living in conflict-affected areas, older women and women with disabilities are particularly at risk of violence and are likely to be disproportionately affected by violence during COVID-19."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-violence-against-women", "question": "Why should I care about violence against women during COVID-19?", "answer": "Violence against women is a grave violation of women’s human rights, no matter when, where, or how it takes place. There are many forms of violence against women, which have many potential negative health consequences for women and their children. Violence against women can result in injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. In extreme cases, violence against women can result in death. The effects of violence are very often long-lived. Violence – in all its forms – can have an impact on a woman’s well-being throughout the rest of her life. This is unacceptable, and the risks of violence that women and their children face during the current COVID-19 crisis cannot be ignored. When we are able to prevent violence, or to support women survivors of violence, we help to safeguard women’s human rights, and promote physical and mental health and well-being for women throughout their lives. This also helps to alleviate pressure on already stretched essential public services, including the health system."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. What are the sources of the cause-of-death statistics?", "answer": "The cause-of-death statistics are from country civil registration systems. When a death occurs, this event is registered at the local civil registry with information on the cause of death. The information is then compiled by the national authority and submitted to WHO every year."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. Are the deaths medically-certified?", "answer": "WHO only publishes here the medically-certified deaths. Diagnoses on causes of death by lay people are not included."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. If the data coverage is not complete, have the data been adjusted for under-coverage?", "answer": "The data presented are as submitted by the countries to WHO. No adjustment has been made to account for under-coverage. Information on the level of data coverage by country are available on same web site where you find this application."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. What kind of corrections have been made to the data?", "answer": "WHO verifies that the data submitted are coded with the official ICD codes. If non-official codes are used, they would be replaced with the most appropriate official codes."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. What are the sources of population data?", "answer": "Some countries submit regularly their population data. However for those who do not submit such data, the population estimates from the United Nations Population Division have been used."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. Which standard population have been used to calculate the age-standardized death rates?", "answer": "WHO has used the world standard population. See under \"Definitions\" in the main menu for further information on it."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. How are the number of deaths and population presented?", "answer": "They are all shown as absolute numbers."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. How are the age-standardized death rates (ASDR) presented?", "answer": "They are all shown as ASDR per 100 000 of the standard population."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. Why are some rates not presented although there are number of deaths?", "answer": "Rates are not calculated for countries with a population < 90,000 in 2017 as for small countries any slight variation in numbers would affect to a large extent the rates. Also when coverage is too low, no rates are presented to avoid misinterpretation."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. The list of countries does not seem to include all the countries in the world. What are the reasons?", "answer": "Simply because some countries do not report mortality data to WHO. However for some countries, the data they sent to WHO are not in standard ICD codes or do not have ICD codes, so they cannot be shown here. In many low-resourced countries, the cause-of-death information is difficult to obtain, mainly because the system for recording such information is not functioning or inexistent. In addition one of the big problems is the lack of medical certifiers to complete the death certificates."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. Are the data for the countries listed mutually exclusive?", "answer": "The data for the countries are mutually exclusive. For e.g. Martinique, Guadeloupe are not included in France."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. Why are some latest years of data missing?", "answer": "Countries usually submit data to WHO within 12-18 months after the closure of their records for the calendar year. Data checking, compilation and verification takes considerable time at the country level."}
{"topic": "/who-mortality-database", "question": "Q. I would like to analyse causes of deaths other than those listed, how do I proceed?", "answer": "On the same web site where you have found this application, there is link to download the raw detailed mortality files for each individual country by ICD code, year, age and sex. The data are available for years starting 1950 to date. You should have some experience in handling big databases (over million records) as the files cannot be imported into Excel. You should use a database management or statistical software such as MS Access, Stata, SAS, SPSS or R."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-active", "question": "What is physical activity?", "answer": "Physical activity includes all forms of active\nrecreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities\nyou do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise\nor sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy\nshopping is all part of being physically active. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are\nvery restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all\nages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from\nsitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or\nstretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve\nblood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help\nto give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and\nfriends."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-active", "question": "Why do we need it?", "answer": "Regular physical activity benefits both the body and\nmind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk\nof heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It also\nimproves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and\nfitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent\nfalls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps support\nhealthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life,\nand through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skills\nand build social relationships. Regular physical activity also improves mental health\nand can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of\ndementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-active", "question": "How much physical activity is recommended?", "answer": "WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend: Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day. Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day. Children and adolescents aged 5-17years all children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week. Adults aged 18 years and over should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per\n        week. older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week. But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent\n    sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-active", "question": "So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?", "answer": "Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities , like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity."}
{"topic": "/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-staying-active", "question": "How do I stay active in and around the home?", "answer": "Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting , whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes.\r\n    Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing. For more ideas and illustrations of healthy stretches\r\n    see here. Set up a regular routine to be active every day , by planning a physical activity or exercise break either by yourself, by joining an online class, or by setting up a time to be active online with your friends or colleagues. Making a specific\r\n    time to be active helps ensure you get your daily physical activity. Put the time in your diary, and it will help remind you. Stick with it, as this will help you build a regular routine, and help you adjust to new ways of working, study and family\r\n    life under COVID-19 restrictions Be active with your family and friends , connecting with others can help you and your family in the home and elsewhere spend time together and be active.

Record your progress on a weekly activity chart and, if you think it would help, reward yourself with something you value. Stay physically active during self-quarantine More physical activity ideas to help you stay active For Infants under 1 year of age Spend regular time doing floor-based play with your baby in a prone position (‘tummy time’) and spread this throughout the day while baby is awake. For Children under 5 years of age Active play in and around the home – invent games which involve being active and can develop skills in throwing, catching, kicking, as well as developing posture and balance. Active play and games where children get out of breath, such as running around, skipping and jumping. For Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years Active games and active play with family. Join in online active games or activity classes, also look for online physical education classes as well as exercise routines suitable for adolescents. Set up playground games indoors such as Jump rope and hop-scotch – make up new games and challenges that involve being active. Learn a new skill – for example try an learn to juggle. Encourage doing some muscle strength training activities such as lifting weights or use improvised weight such as bottles full of water or sand. For Adults Climb up the stairs as much as you can, think of it as an opportunity to be active. Use household chores as a way to be more physical activity. Join in an online exercise class or make up your own routine to music you enjoy that uses the major muscle groups and raises you heart rate.

{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "How has the tobacco industry previously manipulated people and attracted new users?", "answer": "As awareness of the harms of tobacco use grew and global tobacco control efforts intensified over the last decade, social acceptability of tobacco use declined. This catalysed the tobacco industry to revisit old tactics to restore its tarnished reputation\n    and secure a new generation of users. The tobacco industry has made well-researched, calculated attempts to redesign and rebrand its products to sustain profitability. It introduced cigarette filters and the so-called “light” and “mild” tobacco products as an alternative\n    to quitting, reducing tobacco users’ perceptions of risk and harm, and undermining effective tobacco control policies. Such misleading marketing continues today, with the industry advocating for the harm reduction approach\n    through new products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), commonly referred to as ‘e-cigarettes’, and heated tobacco products (HTPs)."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "How are tobacco and related industries marketing new and emerging products?", "answer": "E-cigarettes are often promoted as “reduced risk”, “smoke-free”, “socially acceptable” consumer products. These promotional strategies have the potential to renormalize smoking and drive long-term use of addictive nicotine\n    products which, like tobacco, are undoubtedly harmful to the consumer, under the guise of being a healthier alternative. Tobacco and related industries exploit the fact that the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes have not been established and\n    they are not yet regulated in most countries, enabling them to work around tobacco advertising bans and promote use of their products in smoke-free environments . Some manufacturers also tend to talk about e-cigarettes with HTPs together, thereby confusing potential consumers, and making it difficult to tell the difference between a tobacco and a non-tobacco product. These social-positioning techniques, coupled\n    with strategic marketing tactics, are particularly effective in targeting children and adolescents and have the potential to sustain nicotine addiction in youth globally."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "What sponsorship schemes are used to manipulate children and adolescents?", "answer": "Celebrity and influencer endorsements. Advertising is increasingly shifting to social media platforms, and the nicotine and tobacco industries are no different. “Influencers” on social media who reach and engage children\n        and adolescents are invited by these industries to serve as “brand ambassadors” or offered financial incentives to promote their products.  Social influencers have the potential to give their audiences the impression of more authentic\n        promotion of the products, particularly when posts do not disclose the sponsorship details. Scholarships. Tobacco and ENDS-related entities have offered scholarships to high school, college and graduate students, some requiring applicants to submit essays on the dangers of tobacco and the potential benefits\n        of ENDS use. School programmes and youth camps. Tobacco and ENDS-related entities have paid schools for the opportunity to speak in classrooms or after school. They have also sponsored summer camps to spread misconceptions about\n        the risks of ENDS use and market their products under the guise of promoting “safer alternatives” to conventional tobacco products ."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "What advertising tactics are used to target new, young consumers?", "answer": "Digital and social media advertising. With the pervasiveness of smartphones and constant Internet access, nicotine and tobacco companies have strategically used digital and social media platforms to reach younger generations ,\n including through their favourite apps and video games . Social media platforms allow users to interact with the marketing features, which increases exposure and influence among children and adolescents . They also allow marketers\n        to access profile details of users and their friends and effectively target potential customers. Countries that have adopted advertising, promotion and sponsorship bans, but have not explicitly banned cross-border advertising, are\n        susceptible to exposing their youth to digital and social media advertising originating from other countries. Just over 100 hashtags associated with tobacco companies have been viewed more than 25 billion times around the world between 2007-2016. Attractive displays in retail shops. Vendors near schools are frequently paid to display nicotine and tobacco products in their retail shops, along with sleek point-of-sale display boards, attractive marketing materials and bright,\n        colourful cases to attract young customers. Modern, attractive retail spaces with a wide variety of products that appeal to youth are also now commonly used to market new and novel products. Advertising materials and products at eye-level of children. In many countries, nicotine and tobacco products can be found at children’s eye levels and near shops selling toys, electronic gadgets, sweets, snacks or soda."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "What marketing ploys are used to attract children and adolescents to nicotine and tobacco products?", "answer": "Flavours that appeal to youth. Tobacco products, such as smokeless and water pipe tobacco, are sold in sweet and fruity flavours, which may increase appeal to non-smokers and mask the harsh tobacco taste. To date, researchers have identified over 15,000 e-cigarette flavours available, including flavours proven to appeal to youth, such as cotton candy and gummy bear.  Advertisements of flavoured products may enhance appeal and encourage children and adolescents to buy and try nicotine products . The flavours may lower perception of the harmfulness and addictiveness of nicotine products . Sleek, pocket-sized designs. ENDS and HTPs are extensively promoted as modern, high-tech and high-end lifestyle products, with minimalist designs, and high-profile product launches that portray them as attractive and harmless products. The sleek designs can be deceptive, available in shapes resembling a USB flash drive, and can be easily concealed in a young person’s hand. Cartoon characters. Some ENDS-related entities use cartoons and child-friendly imagery, such as unicorns, to brand their products and market sweet flavours."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "What promotional tactics are used to tempt children and adolescents?", "answer": "Product placement in entertainment media, such as television and cinema . Children and adolescents who watch movies and television shows containing depictions of smoking are at an increased risk of initiating smoking. Exposure to tobacco products or e-cigarette marketing in entertainment media influences children and adolescents’ intention to use these products . Free product samples. Nicotine and tobacco product samples are distributed in high traffic areas, and particularly venues frequented by youth, such as street corners, shopping malls, festivals and concerts, to attract new consumers. In over 50 countries, at least 10% of students aged 13-15 reported ever being offered a free cigarette by a tobacco company representative. Merchandise with company logos. In over 120 countries, at least 1 in 10 students aged 13-15 reported having an object with a tobacco company logo on it."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-industry-tactics-to-attract-younger-generations", "question": "What distribution mechanisms are used to facilitate access to these products?", "answer": "Single stick cigarettes. The sale of cigarettes individually or in small packets increases the affordability and accessibility of tobacco products for school children . Young people that start experimenting with single stick\n        cigarettes do not benefit from exposure to health warnings on cigarette packs. A recent investigation in 45 countries found that students aged 13-15 reported recently purchasing single cigarettes, and in some countries, as many as 80% of students\n        reported purchasing single cigarettes . Disposable e-cigarettes. The option to test and toss different flavours of e-liquids, particularly for a low initial cost, has driven use of disposable e-cigarettes among children and adolescents. In some countries, where\n        flavours are banned in refillable cartridge-based e-cigarettes, children and adolescents have turned to disposable e-cigarettes to continue using flavoured products. Vending machines. Tobacco vending machines provide young people with easy access to tobacco products without needing to provide a form of identification to verify age. In some countries, tobacco vending machines are placed in areas\n        frequented by youth, such as near schools, with attractive advertising and pack displays. Internet sales. Nicotine and tobacco products sold online facilitate sale to minors, particularly where age verification mechanisms are not in place . Online sales also allow children and adolescents to purchase products\n        being sold in other countries where regulations may differ."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What is RTS,S/AS01?", "answer": "RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) is a vaccine that acts against Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa.* In January 2016, the vaccine was recommended by\r\n    WHO for pilot introduction in selected areas of 3 African countries. RTS,S is being evaluated for use as a complementary malaria control tool that could be added to (and not replace) the core package of WHO-recommended preventive, diagnostic and treatment\r\n    measures. * The vaccine offers no protection against P. vivax malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What makes RTS,S different from malaria vaccine candidates currently under development?", "answer": "RTS,S is the first, and to date, the only vaccine that has demonstrated it can significantly reduce malaria, and life-threatening severe malaria, in young African children. Beginning in 2019, 3 sub-Saharan African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi – led the introduction of the vaccine in selected areas of moderate-to-high malaria transmission as part of a large-scale pilot programme coordinated by WHO. The aim is to vaccinate about 360 000 children per year in the selected areas across the 3 countries. Vaccinations are being provided through each country’s routine immunization programme."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What is the efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine?", "answer": "The Phase 3 trial , conducted over 5 years (from 2009 to 2014), enrolled approximately 15 000 young children and infants in 7 sub-Saharan African countries.* The trial sites within these countries represented a range of malaria transmission settings. Among children aged 5–17 months who received 4 doses of RTS,S, the vaccine prevented approximately 4 in 10 (39%) cases of malaria over 4 years of follow-up and about 3 in 10 (29%) cases of severe malaria, ** with significant reductions also seen in overall hospital admissions as well as in admissions due to malaria or severe anaemia. The vaccine also reduced the need for blood transfusions, which are required to treat life-threatening malaria anaemia by 29%. * These countries included: Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and the United Republic of Tanzania. ** Severe malaria refers to those cases where the initial infection with the malaria parasite evolves into an acute, life-threatening illness."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What is WHO’s official position on RTS,S?", "answer": "In October 2015, after a thorough review of the Phase 3 trial results, 2 independent WHO advisory groups – the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG) – jointly called for pilot implementation of the vaccine in 3 to 5 settings in sub-Saharan Africa. In a position paper published on 29 January 2016, WHO officially adopted the joint recommendation of SAGE and MPAG; in doing so, the Organization recognized the public health potential of the RTS,S vaccine while also acknowledging the need for further evaluation before considering wide-scale deployment. There is currently no WHO policy recommendation for the large-scale use of the RTS,S malaria vaccine beyond the pilot programme."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What is the purpose of the malaria vaccine implementation programme?", "answer": "The efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine was established in the Phase 3 clinical trial (see #3, above); children who received 4 doses of the vaccine had a significantly lower risk of developing malaria, including severe malaria. The malaria vaccine implementation programme (MVIP), coordinated by WHO, was designed to address several outstanding questions related to the public health use of the vaccine. Specifically, the MVIP will assess the feasibility of administering the recommended 4 doses of the vaccine in children; the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths; and its safety in the context of routine use. Data and information derived from the pilot will inform a WHO policy recommendation on the broader use of the vaccine. The evaluation protocols have been reviewed and approved by the WHO Ethical Review Committee, and by the institutional or national ethical review committees in each of the pilot countries."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Which countries will participate in MVIP?", "answer": "Three countries – Ghana, Malawi and Kenya – are participating in the MVIP. Each of these countries selected the areas to be included in the pilot programme."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What were the criteria for country selection?", "answer": "In December 2015, WHO issued a call for expressions of interest from African ministries of health to collaborate in the malaria vaccine implementation programme. Of the 10 countries that responded positively, 3 were selected for the programme based on pre-specified criteria. Key among these was the expressed desire by the ministry of health to engage in the MVIP, and well-functioning malaria and immunization programmes. Other criteria included: good coverage of recommended malaria control interventions and childhood vaccinations; moderate-to-high malaria transmission despite good implementation of WHO-recommended malaria interventions; a sufficient number of young children living in the malaria-transmission areas where the vaccine will be introduced; strong implementation research or evaluation experience in the country; and capacity to assess safety outcomes. Participation in the Phase 3 RTS,S trial was an additional criterion considered during the country selection process."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Within the pilot areas, which districts will receive the vaccine first?", "answer": "It is important at this stage to learn how best to introduce the malaria vaccine into routine immunization systems, and to evaluate that introduction. To do this, some districts/sub-counties within the selected areas will have the opportunity to introduce the vaccine into their immunization schedules at the start of the programme, while other districts will not receive the vaccine until a later date, should there be a WHO recommendation for wider use. Assignment of areas into those that receive the vaccine and those that do not has been through a process called “randomization”, based on chance using a computer programme. Introducing the vaccine into some areas, while delaying it in others, is also important for understanding the public health usefulness of the vaccine and will provide key information on whether the vaccine should be introduced throughout the pilot countries and more broadly across Africa."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Who is eligible for vaccination?", "answer": "The vaccine is being delivered by the ministries of health as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI). Children who present to health facilities for vaccination in the pilot areas of the 3 African countries will be able to receive the vaccine as part of their routine immunizations, in selected areas of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Approximately 360 000 children per year across the 3 pilot countries will receive the RTS,S vaccine. Some areas selected for participation in the MVIP will serve as comparator areas in which the vaccine will not be available initially. Immunization authorities in the 3 countries have specified the vaccination schedule, based on WHO recommendations. In Malawi, the vaccine is first offered at 5 months of age, while in Ghana and Kenya, the vaccine is first offered at 6 months of age. A 4-dose schedule is recommended, with the first 3 doses provided at approximately monthly intervals and the fourth dose near the child’s second birthday."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "How do families get the information they need to decide on whether or not to vaccinate their child with the malaria vaccine?", "answer": "As with other vaccines provided to children in routine vaccination settings, the EPI programmes in the pilot countries inform caregivers and communities about the new vaccine before and throughout its introduction. For RTS,S, this includes information about the benefits and risks of the vaccine, at what age a child is eligible for vaccination, the recommended 4-dose vaccination schedule, what to expect following vaccination, and the importance of continuing other malaria control measures (such as using insecticide-treated bed nets). Communities are also told that the vaccine is being provided as part of a pilot introduction. Information is provided one on one by health workers, through health talks led by health officials and health providers – using flip charts, informational leaflets and posters – as well as meetings with community leaders, community health volunteers, public service announcements, and through the local health media, among other methods. Parents who bring their children to clinics for vaccination do so with the option to vaccinate their children or not, as with other vaccines. The vaccine is being delivered through EPI programmes as part of routine delivery, and similar to how other childhood vaccines are offered to families. Because it is not an experimental vaccine, but approved by the regulatory authorities, written consent is not sought for individuals who are vaccinated."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "When did the vaccinations begin?", "answer": "Vaccinations began in the 3 pilot countries in 2019: in Malawi on 23 April, in Ghana on 30 April, and in Kenya on 13 September."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Is the vaccine safe?", "answer": "In the Phase 3 trial, the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with adverse reactions similar to those of other childhood vaccines. A stringent regulatory authority – the European Medicines Agency – issued a positive scientific opinion of the vaccine in July 2015, concluding that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. As with other new vaccines, and in line with national regulations, the safety profile for RTS,S will continue to be monitored. Any safety signals that arose in the clinical testing phase will be monitored closely as the vaccine is introduced more widely. During the Phase 3 trial of the RTS,S vaccine, there were more cases of meningitis in children who received the vaccine than in those who did not; however, no causal link to the vaccine has been established. Overall, there were 29% fewer cases of severe malaria in children who received the vaccine. In those children who did develop severe malaria, there were more cases of cerebral malaria, one type of severe malaria; however, no causal link to the vaccine has been established. Finally, a post-hoc analysis identified an imbalance in female mortality in the phase 3 trial. This was considered by the national regulators and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA concluded that there is insufficient information to classify the finding as a “potential risk” (a formal EMA classification) and that this was likely to be a chance finding, but one that should be monitored during vaccine introduction."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Are there any known side effects?", "answer": "Known side effects include pain and swelling at the injection site, and fever. These side effects are similar to reactions observed with other vaccines given to children. The vaccine is associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures within 7 days of the administration. In the Phase 3 trial, children who had febrile seizures after vaccination recovered completely and there were no long-lasting consequences."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Who developed and who manufactures the vaccine?", "answer": "GSK led the development of RTS,S over a 30-year period. In 2001, GSK began collaborating with PATH’s Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) to continue developing RTS,S. A 5-year Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial was conducted between 2009 and 2014 through a partnership that involved GSK, MVI (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and a network of African research centres at 11 sites in 7 countries. GSK is the vaccine manufacturer."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What is the purpose of the Phase 4 studies, and how do they relate to the MVIP?", "answer": "As part of the malaria vaccine implementation programme, GSK is conducting a number of Phase 4 studies in parts of the pilot areas. These studies – as required and standard for a new vaccine – will gather additional information on the vaccine’s effectiveness and on any side effects associated with routine use. Data collected through the Phase 4 studies will complement data from the pilot evaluations led by WHO."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Which partners are involved in MVIP?", "answer": "The malaria vaccine implementation programme is coordinated by WHO in close collaboration with ministries of health in participating countries and a range of in-country and international partners. Ministries of health in each country are delivering the malaria vaccine through their national immunization programmes in the selected areas. National malaria control programmes are ensuring that existing WHO-recommended prevention tools, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), continue to be deployed on a wide scale. WHO is working with PATH and GSK on the vaccine pilot programme through a collaboration agreement. PATH provides technical and project management support and is leading studies on health care utilization and the economics of vaccine implementation. GSK is donating up to 10 million doses of RTS,S vaccine for use in the pilot and is leading additional studies to continue monitoring the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness in routine use. UNICEF is supporting the forecasting and deployment of the donated RTS,S vaccine to pilot countries. In-country research partners are leading the evaluation of the RTS,S vaccine pilot implementation. This includes a consortium of partners in each pilot country led by the Kintampo Health Research Centre in Ghana; the CDC Foundation in Kenya; and the University of Malawi College of Medicine in Malawi. Health utilization studies are being led by the University of Health and Allied Services in Ghana; the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Kenya; and the Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust in Malawi. Pilot evaluation and health utilization study partners in each country are the following: Ghana: Kintampo Health Research Centre; Navrongo Health Research Centre; Research and Development Division of Ghana Health Service; University of Ghana School of Public Health; Malaria Research Centre, Agogo Presbyterian Hospital; University of Health and Allied Services; Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research; and, the University of Health and Allied Sciences. Kenya: the CDC Foundation (the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Inc.); The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme; the U.S. Army Research Directorate-Kenya; the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI); and, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Malawi: the University of Malawi College of Medicine; the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme; and, the University of North Carolina Project Malawi."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What are the terms of the collaboration agreement between WHO, PATH and GSK?", "answer": "The collaboration agreement between WHO, PATH and GSK defines the roles and responsibilities of these 3 partners for the MVIP. Specifically: WHO is responsible for programme oversight and coordination of all aspects of the malaria vaccine pilot programme; this includes rigorous evaluations of the feasibility of implementing the 4-dose vaccination schedule, and the vaccine’s impact and safety in the context of routine immunization. WHO also provides technical assistance to the Ministries of Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi as the countries introduce the vaccine in selected areas through their national immunization programmes. PATH provides technical and project management support to the programme and is leading studies on health care utilization and the economics of vaccine implementation. GSK is donating up to 10 million doses of RTS,S for use in the pilot programme. GSK is also leading Phase 4 studies to continue to monitor vaccine safety and effectiveness in routine use, as is required and standard for a new vaccine. The partners are also exploring how best to assure the longer-term supply of the vaccine, should there be a WHO policy recommendation for wider use of the vaccine."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Who is funding the MVIP?", "answer": "In November 2016, WHO announced funding commitments for the pilot programme through 2020 by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and Unitaid. In 2019, the trio of global health funding bodies committed additional funding to complete the pilot programme through 2023."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What is the expected duration of the programme?", "answer": "The programme is expected to continue through 2023. The pilot will generate data on the feasibility of delivering the vaccine in childhood vaccination clinics, the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths and its safety in the context of routine use. Results will inform future decisions on the potential wider-scale deployment of the vaccine."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Why is the MVIP being rolled out only in Africa, and not in other regions?", "answer": "The WHO African region bears the greatest burden of malaria worldwide. Young children are especially vulnerable: in 2018 alone, malaria claimed the lives of approximately 265 000 African children under the age of 5.* Over the last 2 decades, African countries have made tremendous progress in the fight against malaria using core WHO-recommended tools such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor spraying with insecticides and antimalarial medicines. However, in some areas where these approaches have been adopted, malaria illness and death remain stubbornly high. New and complementary tools are needed to further drive down the disease burden, with a view to ultimately achieving the vision of a world free of malaria. Most malaria illness and death in the African region are caused by the parasite targeted by the RTS,S vaccine ( P. falciparum ). The vaccine was developed specifically for African children who are at highest risk of dying of malaria. Additional studies will be needed before the vaccine can be recommended for use outside Africa. * In 2018, children under 5 accounted for two thirds (67%) of global malaria deaths, the vast majority of which (approximately 265 000) were African children. Globally, there were an estimated 405 000 deaths from malaria in 2018."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "What other interventions exist for malaria control?", "answer": "Existing WHO-recommended interventions for malaria control include: LLINs, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, preventive treatment for infants and during pregnancy, and prompt diagnostic testing and treatment of confirmed cases with effective anti-malarial medicines. In the Sahel, a sub-Saharan region of Africa, seasonal malaria chemoprevention is recommended in areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission. Deployment of these tools has already dramatically lowered the malaria disease burden in many African settings. The disease burden can be further lowered through the continued scale-up of these existing control measures. While efforts to sustain and further expand existing interventions must continue, new complementary tools and strategies are needed in some areas to accelerate the fight against malaria and further drive down the disease burden. The malaria vaccine is proposed as a potential additional tool to complement the existing package of WHO-recommended preventive, diagnostic and treatment measures for malaria."}
{"topic": "/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme", "question": "Is RTS,S licensed by a regulatory authority?", "answer": "Following a joint review convened by the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF) in May 2018, the National Regulatory Authorities of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi authorized the RTS,S vaccine for use in the pilot areas. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) carried out a scientific assessment of RTS,S and issued a “European scientific opinion” on the vaccine in July 2015. This opinion was given as part of the EMA’s cooperation with WHO, whereby EMA provides opinions on medicines that are not intended for use in the European Union but are needed to prevent or treat diseases of major public health importance around the world. The EMA found that the quality of the vaccine and its risk-benefit profile are favorable from a regulatory perspective. EMA’s opinion did not consider contextual elements such as the feasibility of implementation, the value of the vaccine in the context of other malaria control measures, and the likely cost-effectiveness of the intervention in different settings."}
{"topic": "/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health", "question": "What is 5G?", "answer": "5G, or fifth Generation, is the latest wireless mobile phone technology, first widely deployed in 2019. 5G is expected to increase performance and a wide range of new applications, including strengthening e-Health (telemedicine, remote surveillance, telesurgery)."}
{"topic": "/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health", "question": "What are the main differences between 5G and previous technologies?", "answer": "5G represents an evolution in telecommunication standards. To enable increased performance, 5G will extend into higher frequencies around 3.5 GHz and up to a few tens of GHz.  The higher frequencies are new to mobile phone networks, but are commonly used in other applications, such as point-to-point radio links and body-scanners for security checks. At these higher frequencies, 5G networks will use a greater number of base stations and of connected objects. 5G will further employ beam-forming antennas to focus signals more efficiently towards the device in use, rather than having the signal spread in broad directions as in current base station antennas."}
{"topic": "/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health", "question": "Exposure levels", "answer": "Currently, exposure from 5G infrastructures at around 3.5 GHz is similar to that from existing mobile phone base stations. With the use of multiple beams from 5G antennas, exposure could be more variable as a function of location of the users and their usage. Given that the 5G technology is currently at an early stage of deployment, the extent of any change in exposure to radiofrequency fields is still under investigation."}
{"topic": "/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health", "question": "What are the potential health risks from 5G?", "answer": "To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G. Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated."}
{"topic": "/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health", "question": "What are the international exposure guidelines?", "answer": "Two international bodies produce exposure guidelines on electromagnetic fields. Many countries currently adhere to the guidelines recommended by: The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, through the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety These guidelines are not technology-specific. They cover radiofrequencies up to 300 GHz, including the frequencies under discussion for 5G."}
{"topic": "/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health", "question": "What is WHO doing?", "answer": "WHO is conducting a health risk assessment from exposure to radiofrequencies, covering the entire radiofrequency range, including 5G, to be published by 2022. WHO will review scientific evidence related to potential health risks from 5G exposure as the new technology is deployed, and as more public health-related data become available. WHO established the International Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Project in 1996. The project investigates the health impact of exposure to electric and magnetic fields in the frequency range 0-300 GHz and advises national authorities on EMF radiation protection. WHO advocates for further research into the possible long-term health impacts of all aspects of mobile-telecommunications. The Organization identifies and promotes related research priorities. It also develops public information materials and promotes dialogue among scientists, governments, and the public to increase understanding around health and mobile communications."}

{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "What is lymphatic filariasis?", "answer": "Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring parasitic disease. In communities where the parasite is transmitted, all ages are affected. While the infection may be acquired during childhood its visible manifestations may occur later in life, causing temporary or permanent disability. In endemic countries, lymphatic filariasis has a major social and economic impact."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "What causes lymphatic filariasis?", "answer": "The disease is caused by three species of thread-like nematode worms, known as filariae – Wuchereria bancrofti (responsible of 90% of the cases) , Brugia malayi and Brugia timori . Male worms are about 3–4 centimetres in length, and female worms 8–10 centimetres. The male and female worms together form “nests” in the human lymphatic system, the network of nodes and vessels that maintain the delicate fluid balance between blood and body tissues. The lymphatic system is an essential component of the body’s immune system."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "How is the parasite transmitted?", "answer": "Adult male and female worms lodge in the lymphatics. Fecund females release larvae (microfilaria) which periodically circulate in the blood. Microfilaria circulating in the blood can be ingested by feeding mosquito vectors. Microfilaria must mature in the vector before becoming infective. The mosquitoes can then spread infective larvae to new hosts when feeding. The major vectors of W. bancrofti are mosquitoes of the genus Culex (in urban and semi-urban areas), Anopheles (in rural areas of Africa and elsewhere) and Aedes (in islands of the Pacific)."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "Where is lymphatic filariasis most commonly found?", "answer": "An estimated 120 million people in tropical and subtropical areas of the world are infected with lymphatic filariasis. Of the total population requiring preventative chemotherapy to interrupt the transmission cycle, 57% live in the South-East Asia Region (9 countries) and 37% live in the African Region (35 countries)."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "What are the signs and symptoms of lymphatic filariasis?", "answer": "Filarial infection can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including lymphoedema of the limbs, genital disease (hydrocele, chylocele, and swelling of the scrotum and penis) and recurrent acute attacks, which are extremely painful and are accompanied by fever. The vast majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but virtually all of them have subclinical lymphatic damage and as many as 40% have kidney damage, with proteinuria and haematuria."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "How is lymphatic filariasis diagnosed?", "answer": "There are two methods to diagnose the disease. One can either detect the presence of circulating microfilariae in the blood by examining thick smears (20–60 μl) of finger-prick blood. Blood must be collected at a specific time – either at night or during the day – depending on the periodicity of the microfilariae. The second possibility is to detect Wuchereria bancrofti (the parasite) antigen in human blood samples using the rapid diagnostic test Alere Filariasis Test Strip."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "Can lymphatic filariasis be cured?", "answer": "All people with filariasis who have microfilaraemia or a positive antigen test should receive antifilarial drug treatment to eliminate microfilariae. Unfortunately, the medicines available have limited effect on adult worms. Treatment also requires managing morbidity and preventing disabilities for affected people."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "Can lymphatic filariasis be prevented?", "answer": "Avoidance of mosquito bites through personal protection measures or community-level vector control and participation in MDA (Mass Drug Administration) at the community level is the best option to prevent lymphatic filariasis. The primary goal of treating affected communities is to eliminate microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals in order to interrupt transmission of infection by mosquitoes. Studies have shown that > 5 years of MDA with preventive chemotherapy reduces microfilariae from the bloodstream and prevents the spread of microfilariae to mosquitoes."}
{"topic": "/lymphatic-filariasis", "question": "What is the difference between lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis?", "answer": "Podoconiosis is a type of tropical lymphoedema clinically distinguished from lymphatic filariasis through being ascending and commonly bilateral but asymmetric. Evidence suggests that podoconiosis is the result of a genetically determined abnormal inflammatory reaction to mineral particles in irritant red clay soils derived from volcanic deposits. It is a non-parasitic disease. It is mostly found in highland areas of tropical Africa, Central America and north-west India. Like lymphatic filariasis, podoconiosis results in impairments due to lymphoedema. As is the case for lymphatic filariasis, a basic package of care can alleviate suffering and prevent further progression of disease and disability."}
{"topic": "/how-do-i-protect-my-health-in-a-flood", "question": "How do I protect my health in a flood?", "answer": "Since floods can potentially increase the transmission of water- and vector-borne diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, among others, it is important to know your risk and protect your water sources. The most common risks associated with flooding is the contamination of drinking-water facilities, and standing water, which can be a breeding site for mosquitoes, bring chemical hazards, and cause injuries. Protect your health during a flood by: Knowing your community’s evacuation route and warning signals, and identifying areas prone to flooding or landslides. Chlorinating or boiling all water for drinking and food preparation Ensuring uninterrupted provision of safe drinking water is the most important preventive measure to be implemented following flooding, in order to reduce the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases. Promoting good hygienic practices and safe food preparation techniques Do not use flood water to wash dishes, brush teeth or wash and prepare food. Always wash your hands with soap and water if you have been in contact with floodwater. Avoiding walking or driving through flooded areas and standing water. Even the smallest amount of water can bring about significant dangers. You do not know if electrical lines have fallen in the water or hazardous chemicals exist. Cars and people can easily be swept away during a flood. Throwing away any food that has come in contact with floodwater. If your food has touched any floodwater, it is not safe to eat and increases your risk of water-borne diseases. Safely cleaning your home if it has come in contact with floodwater. Throw out any items that cannot be washed and cleaned with bleach, such as pillows and mattresses. Clean all walls, floors and other surfaces with soap and water, as well as bleach. Protect against mosquitos If your home is in an area with stagnant or standing water, use mosquito repellent, following the instructions on the label, and apply it to clothes or skin. Also wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, and cover beds with mosquito nets when sleeping. Additional resources Drinking water Vector-borne diseases Five Keys to Safer Food"}
{"topic": "/health-statistics", "question": "How do statistics improve health?", "answer": "Countries need health statistics in order to identify why \npeople die or what causes illness or injury. This information enables \ncountries to target their health problems and prioritize the use of \nprecious health resources. Every year WHO analyses data from its 194 Member States and \nproduces burden of disease and mortality health estimates, which are \npublished in the \"World health statistics\". These estimates are a report\n card of global health. They tell us, for example, that risks to health \nare changing. Fewer people are dying from infectious diseases in low- \nand middle-income countries but more people are suffering from chronic \ndiseases due to changing patterns of physical activity and consumption \nof alcohol, tobacco and food. These countries now suffer from a double \nburden of chronic, non-communicable conditions as well as the diseases \nthat traditionally affect the poor."}
{"topic": "/health-statistics", "question": "How does WHO collect statistics?", "answer": "WHO statistics are generated from multiple sources using a \nvariety of data collection methods, including household surveys, routine\n reporting by health services, civil registration and censuses and \ndisease surveillance systems.

{"topic": "/violence-against-children-how-can-it-be-prevented", "question": "How can violence against children be prevented?", "answer": "There are two distinct types of violence experienced by \nchildren (defined by the United Nations as anyone aged 0-18 years) - \nchild maltreatment by parents and caregivers in children aged 0-14, and \nviolence occurring in community settings among adolescents aged 15-18 \nyears. These different types of violence can be prevented by addressing \nthe underlying causes and risk factors specific to each type. Child maltreatment by parents and caregivers can be prevented by: reducing unintended pregnancies; reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy; reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use by new parents; improving access to high quality pre- and post-natal services; providing home visitation services by professional nurses and \nsocial workers to families where children are at high-risk of \nmaltreatment; providing training for parents on child development, non-violent discipline and problem-solving skills. Violence involving children in community settings can be prevented through: pre-school enrichment programmes to give young children an educational head start; life skills training; assisting high-risk adolescents to complete schooling; reducing alcohol availability through the enactment and enforcement of liquor licensing laws, taxation and pricing; restricting access to firearms. Improving the efficiency of pre-hospital and emergency medical\n care will reduce  the risk of death, the time for recovery and the \nlevel of long-term impairment due to violence. All violence against children and especially child \nmaltreatment occurring in the first decade of life is both a problem in \nitself and a major risk factor for other forms of violence and health \nproblems through a person's life. For instance, a WHO study estimated \nthat the lifetime impact of child sexual abuse accounts for \napproximately 6% of cases of depression, 6% of alcohol and drug \nabuse/dependence, 8% of suicide attempts, 10% of panic disorders and 27%\n of post traumatic stress disorders. Other studies have also linked \nchild physical abuse, sexual abuse and other childhood adversities to \nexcessive smoking, eating disorders, and high-risk sexual behaviour, \nwhich in turn are associated with some of the leading causes of death \nincluding cancers and cardiovascular disorders. WHO supports countries to collect data and information related\n to violence against children, develop national violence prevention \npolicies and programmes, and create systems for the provision of \nappropriate medico-legal and emergency trauma care.

{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-does-stopping-a-course-of-antibiotics-early-lead-to-antibiotic-resistance", "question": "Does stopping a course of antibiotics early lead to antibiotic resistance?", "answer": "There has been a lot of research into how long antibiotic \r\ncourses should be, to determine the shortest possible length of course \r\nneeded to completely kill all bacteria. If you are being treated for an infection, the kind of \r\nantibiotics your doctor prescribes and the length of the course should \r\nbe based on the best evidence. Feeling better, or an improvement in symptoms, does not always\r\n mean that the infection has completely gone. Your doctor has had years \r\nof training and has access to the latest evidence – so always follow \r\ntheir advice. Evidence is emerging that shorter courses of antibiotics may \r\nbe just as effective as longer courses for some infections. Shorter \r\ntreatments make more sense – they are more likely to be completed \r\nproperly, have fewer side effects and also likely to be cheaper. They \r\nalso reduce the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, thereby reducing \r\nthe speed by which the pathogen develops resistance. WHO publishes guidelines about treatments for different \r\ninfections and recommends treatment durations and doses of antibiotics \r\nbased on the best clinical evidence for each case.

It includes: undernutrition: when a person does not get enough food to eat,\n    causing them to be wasted (this is also called acute malnutrition, when\n    someone is too thin for their height) and/or stunted (this is also\n    called chronic malnutrition, when someone is too short for their age).\n    Undernutrition increases the risk of infectious diseases like diarrhoea,\n    measles, malaria and pneumonia, and chronic malnutrition can impair a\n    young child’s physical and mental development. micronutrient deficiencies: when a person does not get enough\n    important vitamins and minerals in their diet. Micronutrient\n    deficiencies can lead to poor health and development, particularly in\n    children and pregnant women. overweight and obesity: linked to an unbalanced or unhealthy diet\n    resulting in eating too many calories and often associated with lack of\n    exercise. Overweight and obesity can lead to diet-related\n    noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure\n    (hypertension), stroke, diabetes and cancer. Starvation is a severe lack of food which can result in death."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition-emergencies-and-disasters", "question": "How big a problem is malnutrition in emergencies?", "answer": "In emergencies, people are at higher risk of undernutrition \nand micronutrient deficiencies. Those whose nutrition was poor before \nthe crisis are even more vulnerable. Acute malnutrition weakens the \nimmune system, which then becomes more susceptible to developing \ndiseases that can be fatal. Undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies can be \nwidespread among refugees and displaced people, as adequate food and \nhealth services are often not readily accessible. Inadequate nutrition and repeated bouts of infection during \nthe first 1000 days of a child’s life can cause stunting, which has \nirreversible long-term effects on the physical and mental development of\n children. Worldwide in 2015, there were 156 million stunted children, \nabout 45% of them living in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Emergencies can also aggravate diet-related noncommunicable \ndisease, such as heart disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), \ndiabetes and cancer. Healthy foods may not be regularly available and \nappropriate medical care may not be accessible, leading to the \ninterruption or cessation of treatments for these diseases. Given that \nmany populations have high levels of noncommunicable diseases, \nemergencies can cause a significant increase in illness and even death \nfrom these diseases."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition-emergencies-and-disasters", "question": "Who is most vulnerable to undernutrition and starvation during emergencies?", "answer": "Young children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are\n most vulnerable to undernutrition. Their bodies have a greater need for\n nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, and are more susceptible to \nthe harmful consequences of deficiencies. Children are at the highest risk of dying from starvation. \nThey become undernourished faster than adults. Severely wasted children \nare 11 times more likely to die than those with a healthy weight. \nUndernourished children catch infections more easily and have a harder \ntime recovering because their immune systems are impaired. Globally, \nundernutrition is an underlying factor in more than half of child deaths\n from pneumonia and malaria, and more than 40% of measles deaths."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition-emergencies-and-disasters", "question": "How should severe acute malnutrition be treated in an emergency?", "answer": "Severe acute malnutrition is when a person is extremely thin \nand at risk of dying. They need immediate treatment. The response to \nacute malnutrition is broad and includes several elements such as \nmedical, food, water and hygiene, and social services. Children who still have an appetite can stay at home and \nreceive outpatient care. They need treatment with specially-formulated \nfoods, and their recovery must be monitored regularly by a trained \nhealth worker. Children who have medical problems and do not have an appetite\n need inpatient care in a clinic or hospital. They need \nspecially-formulated milks and treatment for infections or other \npotential complications."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition-emergencies-and-disasters", "question": "Why is it so important for infants to breastfeed during emergencies?", "answer": "Breastfeeding can be life-saving for young children in emergencies. Breastfeeding in all environments has major health benefits \nfor both children and mothers. Breast milk gives infants all the \nnutrients they need for healthy growth and development. It is readily \navailable and contains antibodies that protect infants from common \nchildhood illnesses. Breastfeeding also reduces mothers’ risks of breast\n and ovarian cancer, type II diabetes, and postpartum depression. Breastfeeding becomes even more critical for child survival in\n humanitarian emergencies. Young children in emergencies face higher \nrisks of diarrhoea, pneumonia and undernutrition. Lack of food, unsafe \nwater, poor sanitation, overcrowding and overburdened health systems put\n infants and young children at greater risk. WHO recommends that all babies should be fed only breast milk \nfor the first 6 months, after which they should continue breastfeeding \n(as well as eating other foods) until 2 years of age, and potentially \nfor longer, even in emergency situations."}
{"topic": "/malnutrition-emergencies-and-disasters", "question": "What are the challenges to breastfeeding in emergency situations?", "answer": "Often the poor physical and mental health of mothers in \r\nemergencies leads to poor breastfeeding outcomes. Displaced mothers may \r\nstruggle to find comfortable, private places to breastfeed and their \r\nsupport network of family and friends is often not accessible in \r\nemergencies. Health workers who would usually offer support may be \r\nredeployed to cope with other aspects of the emergency response. Well-meaning donors may distribute breast-milk substitutes \r\n(such as infant formula) in emergencies. This can undermine \r\nbreastfeeding and, if there is a lack of clean water to make formula or \r\nclean bottles and teats, put children at increased risk of infections \r\nwhich can be deadly. Governments and humanitarian organizations have a key role to \r\nplay in protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding in \r\nemergencies."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "When should a UTN be obtained?", "answer": "It is recommended that the UTN be obtained as soon as the \r\nfirst draft of the protocol has been compiled, although it can be \r\nobtained either sooner or later. For example: as soon as an investigator has an idea as soon as the idea becomes a research proposal at the time the first draft of the protocol is compiled at the time the first meeting is held to discuss the protocol at the time the first meeting of potential investigators is held A UTN may be obtained later in the trial's history (e.g. at \r\nthe time of submission to the first ethics committee, or at the time of \r\nsubmission to a funding agency). It is likely to be more effective in \r\nunambiguously identifying a trial, though, if it is obtained early."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "How can we obtain a UTN?", "answer": "Go to https://trialsearch.who.int/utn.aspx and follow the instructions. The process of obtaining a UTN involves 2 stages: applying for and obtaining a security code applying for and obtaining the UTN To apply for the security code, the applicant will need to provide: the name of the individual submitting the request (Requestor) the email address of the individual submitting the request the Requestor's organization An email containing a secure hyperlink will then be sent to \r\nthe email address entered. You should click on the hyperlink which will \r\ntake you to the 'Get UTN' web site, where you should click on 'Get UTN'.\r\n The UTN will then be sent to you in an email."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "Who should obtain the UTN?", "answer": "The Sponsor, the Principal Investigator or other appropriate \r\nperson (for example, the administrator of a collaborative trials group) \r\nshould obtain a UTN for each trial."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "How many UTNs should a trial have?", "answer": "One only."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "What should we do with the UTN?", "answer": "You should use it every time you need to identify the trial. The \r\nUTN should be submitted whenever the trial is registered. It may be \r\nentered into a field dedicated specifically to the UTN, or it may be \r\nentered into the secondary identifier field."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "Is the UTN mandatory?", "answer": "No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries \r\nmay choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a \r\ntrial on their registry."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "What should we do if a trial registry does not have a separate field for the UTN?", "answer": "If a trial registry does not have a specific field for the UTN, enter it in the secondary identifier field. No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries \r\nmay choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a \r\ntrial on their registry."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "How will the UTN work?", "answer": "The UTN will be one of many identifiers that a trial may have,\r\n just as a driving license number may be one of many identifiers that an\r\n individual human has. Even though a single object has multiple \r\nidentifiers, each one may play a role in helping to identify the object.\r\n When an individual applies for a passport, for example, they may be \r\nrequired to show 3 forms of identification (such as driving license \r\nnumber, a credit card number, a utilities bill number) to verify that an\r\n individual exists. Similarly, when a trial is registered, multiple \r\nidentifiers may be able to help us to verify that a trial exists. The UTN will help us to unambiguously identify a trial by enabling us to link (or \"bridge\") multiple records on the same trial together on the ICTRP search portal."}
{"topic": "/universal-trial-numbers", "question": "What if my trial was registered before the UTN?", "answer": "We recognize that in some circumstances, a trial registered \r\nprior to the inception of the UTN may request retrospective assignment. \r\n UTN numbers may be issued for previously registered trials. In order to avoid duplication of records and permit accurate \r\nrecord bridging on the ICTRP, it is strongly suggested that only the \r\ncoordinating centre apply for the UTN. Once the UTN has been assigned, \r\nthe coordinating centre should update all records within primary \r\nregisters and on all other documentation (e.g., ethical review committee\r\n submissions, letters, etc) to reflect the UTN. Remember a trial, no matter how many sites should have only one UTN. Circumstances where retrospective UTN applications may be considered are: proposal, registered (not yet enrolling) trial registered and enrolment terminated trial registered, still enrolling, no new sites trial registered, still enrolling, adding a new site As the primary purpose of the UTN is to identify a trial \r\nthrough stages of a clinical trial (including registration, approvals, \r\ntrial recruitment, and participant follow up), the utility of a UTN \r\nfollowing trial completion and/or publication is currently limited.  \r\nWhile it is possible to apply for a UTN, it is again strongly suggested \r\nthat this be a centralized process and that all documentation be linked \r\nto the UTN, retrospectively."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What is a clinical trial", "answer": "For the purposes of registration, a clinical trial is any research\r\n study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans\r\n to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on \r\nhealth outcomes. Clinical trials may also be referred to as \r\ninterventional trials. Interventions include but are not restricted to \r\ndrugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, \r\nradiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care \r\nchanges, preventive care, etc. This definition includes Phase I to Phase IV trials ."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "Which trials should be registered?", "answer": "All clinical trials meeting the above definition should be \nregistered. Thus, early and late trials, trials of marketed or \nnon-marketed products, randomized or non-randomized trials -- all should\n be registered."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What is the difference between a clinical trials register and a clinical trials registry?", "answer": "A clinical trials register is the formal record of an \ninternationally agreed minimum amount of information about a clinical \ntrial. This record is usually stored in and managed using a database. A \nclinical trials registry is the entity that houses the register, and is \nresponsible for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the \ninformation it contains, and that the registered information is used to \ninform health care decision making. A clinical trials registry is more \nthan its database."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "Why register clinical trials?", "answer": "Why is Trial Registration Important? The registration of all interventional trials is considered to be a scientific, ethical and moral responsibility because: There is a need to ensure that decisions about health care are informed by all of the available evidence. It is difficult to make informed decisions if publication bias and selective reporting are present. The Declaration of Helsinki states that \"Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly \r\naccessible database before recruitment of the first subject\". Improving awareness of similar or identical trials will make it \r\npossible for researchers and funding agencies to avoid unnecessary \r\nduplication. Describing clinical trials in progress can make it easier to identify gaps in clinical trials research. Making researchers and potential participants aware of recruiting trials may facilitate recruitment. Enabling researchers and health care practitioners to identify \r\ntrials in which they may have an interest could result in more effective\r\n collaboration among researchers. The type of collaboration may include prospective meta-analysis. Registries checking data as part of the registration process may \r\nlead to improvements in the quality of clinical trials by making it \r\npossible to identify potential problems (such as problematic \r\nrandomization methods) early in the research process."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "Who is responsible for registering a trial?", "answer": "An appropriate representative of the trial’s primary Sponsor.\n The Responsible Registrant is responsible for ensuring that the trial \nis properly registered. The primary Sponsor may or may not be the \nprimary funder. The responsible registrant should make every reasonable \neffort to ensure that a trial is registered once and only once in any \none register, and that the trial is registered in the fewest number of \nregisters necessary to meet applicable regulations."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "When should trials be registered?", "answer": "Trials should be registered before the first participant is recruited."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "Can I register with the WHO ICTRP?", "answer": "No, WHO does not maintain its own registry so you cannot register your trial directly with us."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What information needs to be registered?", "answer": "The minimum information that must be registered is specified in the WHO Trial Registration Data Set . Individual registers may request more information than this (e.g., study sites)."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "Are there software or hardware specifications that should be followed for building a trial registry?", "answer": "Yes, please contact us."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "How many times should a trial be registered?", "answer": "To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication it is \nonly necessary for your trial to be to registered once, in either a Primary Registry or an ICMJE approved registry ."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "How do I cite a record on a clinical trials register?", "answer": "Please read this document, pdf 21kb"}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "When to cite a record on a clinical trials register", "answer": "The registry record will be the only publicly available \r\ndocument on a trial until results from the trial are published. Some \r\nexamples of situations when studies might be quoted are: When a manuscript reporting the results of the trial is published or otherwise reported When a manuscript reporting methodological issues relating to a particular trial are published or otherwise reported In protocols to systematic reviews, or in completed systematic reviews (e.g. when a list of ongoing trials are included) In protocols to prospective meta-analyses, which will list the ongoing trials to be included In any manuscript when reference to an ongoing or unpublished (or even published) trial might be relevant"}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What is trial registration?", "answer": "WHO regards trial registration as the publication of an internationally-agreed set of information\r\n about the design, conduct and administration of clinical trials. These \r\ndetails are published on a publicly-accessible website managed by a \r\nregistry conforming to WHO standards. What is the ICTRP? The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is a global initiative that aims to make information\r\n about all clinical trials involving humans publicly available. It also \r\naims to: To improve the comprehensiveness, completeness and accuracy of registered clinical trial data To communicate and raise awareness of the need to register clinical trials To ensure the accessibility of registered data To build capacity for clinical trial registration To encourage the utilization of registered data To ensure the sustainability of the ICTRP"}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What does the ICTRP do?", "answer": "The ICTRP: Publishes the ICTRP Search Portal Supports the WHO Registry Network Supports countries and regions wanting to establish WHO-compliant clinical trial registries or policies on trial registration."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "How does the ICTRP support countries and regions?", "answer": "If an agency in a member state (such as a Ministry of Health \nor a National Regulatory Authority) is interested in establishing a new \nclinical trial registry that complies with WHO criteria (or improving an\n existing registry), or in establishing policies that require \nregistration in an existing Primary Registry, then they can approach the\n ICTRP for support. The types of support requested will vary and depend \non the specific needs of the member state. It may include: Advice on how to meet the criteria required by a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network The different models for achieving trial registration and the \nneed to work with key agencies such as regulatory authorities and \nresearch ethics committees (or Institutional Review Boards) to ensure \ncompliance Database and software issues, including data interchange standards Developing and implementing standard operating procedures to ensure high quality data Facilitating collaboration with other member states, particularly those in the same region or those that speak the same language The ICTRP works with only 1 registry per member state, and \nencourages collaboration across member states to build regional \nsolutions, particularly when languages are shared. If a member state has\n more than one registry then it is up to that member state to determine \nwhich one will be the national registry."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What is a Primary Registry?", "answer": "A Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network is a clinical trial registry with at least a national remit that meets WHO Registry Criteria\r\n for content, quality and validity, accessibility, unique \r\nidentification, technical capacity and governance and administration. \r\nPrimary Registries have the support of the ICMJE."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "How does a registry become a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network?", "answer": "The ICTRP is a country-led initiative. Clinical trial \r\nregistration happens when countries seek to improve the transparency of \r\nclinical trial research involving nationals of that country, and to be \r\nmore accountable to the individuals who consent to participate in \r\nclinical research, and to better oversee and monitor that research. It \r\nis up to each country to decide if they want to have a clinical trial \r\nregistry and, if so, where that registry will be housed. To become a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network a registry must: Submit a Registry Profile (available from the ICTRP Secretariat) Meet all of the WHO Registry Criteria Be approved by the Chief Scientist of the World Health Organization View the list Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network. Only registries on this list meet WHO requirements. The designation as a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry \r\nNetwork is conditional on continuing compliance with WHO Registry \r\ncriteria."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "What should I do if I want to take part in clinical trial?", "answer": "If you are patient or family member and you find a trial that \nis of interest we suggest that you print out the information and discuss\n it with your health care provider. They should be able to advise you on\n the appropriate course of action. If you are a health care provider or researcher you should approach one of the contact persons listed in the registered record."}
{"topic": "/clinical-trials", "question": "How can I register a trial?", "answer": "You cannot register a trial with WHO. The WHO ICTRP is not a clinical trials registry. To register a trial, submit the details directly to any one of the Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry . To meet the requirements of the International Committee of \nMedical Journal Editors (ICMJE) you can register your trial with any \nPrimary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved \nregistry. To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication, it \nis only necessary for your trial to be registered once, in either a \nPrimary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved \nregistry. NOTE: Regulatory, legal, ethical, funding and other \nrequirements for oversight and conduct of clinical trials differ from \ncountry to country. It is recommended that those responsible for \nconducting a clinical trial check to make sure they are complying with \nthe specific requirements of each country."}

{"topic": "/emergencies-risk-communication", "question": "What is risk communication?", "answer": "Risk communication refers to the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts or officials and people who face a threat (hazard) to their survival, health or economic or social well-being. Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action. Risk communication uses many communications techniques ranging from media and social media communications to mass communications and stakeholder and community engagement. It requires the understanding of stakeholder perceptions, concerns and beliefs, as well as their knowledge and practices. Effective risk communication must also identify early on and subsequently manage rumours, misinformation and other communications challenges."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-risk-communication", "question": "Why is risk communication important?", "answer": "Risk communication refers to the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts or officials and people who face a threat (hazard) to their survival, health or economic or social well-being.

Effective risk communication must also identify early on and subsequently manage rumours, misinformation and other communications challenges."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-risk-communication", "question": "How does risk communication work?", "answer": "Risk communication only works when there is communication based on trust between those who know (experts), those in charge (authorities) and those affected. Without trust, people are unlikely to follow the advice given. Listening to and understanding peoples’ beliefs, concerns and perceptions is just as important as providing them with facts and advice. Explaining honestly what is known and admitting what is uncertain is essential. The credibility of those giving advice; their expressions of caring and empathy; and identifying with the audience are factors that make risk communication effective."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-risk-communication", "question": "What help can countries get to improve their capacity to communicate risk during emergencies?", "answer": "Countries report that they have made progress in risk communication capacity over recent years. However, as health emergencies become increasingly complex, as witnessed during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa and in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus, more help is being requested from WHO and partners. WHO provides global guidance on best practices for risk communication and is supporting countries to build up capacities through establishing the right policy, strategy and plans for risk communication, providing training for key personnel, engaging and training journalists on how to report on health emergencies, and running simulation exercises to test national systems. In emergencies, WHO provides hands on support for response by deploying its Emergency Communications Network to affected countries and regions to work hand-in-hand with national and local authorities."}
{"topic": "/human-genome-editing-registry", "question": "What is the aim of the HGE Registry?", "answer": "In accordance with the principles of transparency and inclusivity, the HGE Registry aims at making information about the kind of research and development that is happening publicly accessible to all interested stakeholders. Making such information available will also contribute to inform appropriate governance."}
{"topic": "/human-genome-editing-registry", "question": "Why is there a phased approached?", "answer": "The Committee agreed on a phased approach, with an initial focus on clinical applications and subsequent efforts to incorporate relevant basic research on human embryos and germline cells. The Committee agreed to begin piloting the first phase of the HGE Registry and begin to consult with those communities most likely to generate relevant work."}
{"topic": "/human-genome-editing-registry", "question": "What is the scope of the HGE Registry?", "answer": "In a first phase, the HGE Registry will cover both somatic and germline clinical trials. The creation of the HGE Registry that covers any proposed clinical trials involving genome editing tools on human embryos and germline cells does not mean that WHO advocates and endorses such activities. In a statement issued on 26 July 2019, the WHO Director General agreed with the WHO Expert Advisory Committee’s recommendation that it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing. In a second phase, the HGE Registry will also cover research using genome editing technologies on (i) human embryos and on (ii) germline cells or their progenitors when gametes derived from these will be used to create embryos, even when there is no attempt to initiate/establish a pregnancy."}
{"topic": "/human-genome-editing-registry", "question": "How does the search filter work?", "answer": "The HGE Registry identifies clinical trials using genome editing tools by using a filter specifically developed for this purpose. The search filter includes keywords such as “genome editing”, “gene editing”, “CRISPR”, “ZFN” and “TALEN” and several associated products. This filter of keywords was created by the Registry Working Group, which is a sub-group of the WHO Expert Advisory Committee. Searching the complete database of registered records by keywords remains problematic. Indeed, there are risks of having false positives but also, when clinical trials are not using the identified keywords, of missing relevant clinical trials. The feedback of users is therefore very important to continue to improve the accuracy of the search filter. Please contact us if you have any comment or suggestion on the search filter or if you think that a clinical trial is missing from the list of results. In order to better identify clinical trials using genome editing tools, the filter will be regularly revised."}
{"topic": "/human-genome-editing-registry", "question": "How to register a trial?", "answer": "You cannot register a trial with the WHO Human Genome Editing (HGE) Registry. The HGE Registry is not a clinical trials registry but it is a central database that collects information of clinical trials using human genome editing technologies. The HGE Registry is using the data collected by the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), which gathers the trial registration data sets provided by Primary Registries. To register a trial, you need to submit the details of your trial directly to any one of t he Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry .

{"topic": "/emergencies-myths-and-realities-in-disaster-situations", "question": "Do starving people eat anything?", "answer": "It is widely held that people who are starving will be very hungry and eat any food that can be supplied. This attitude is inhumane and incorrect. Even if hungry initially, people often do not consume adequate quantities of unvaried and unfamiliar foods for long enough. More importantly, the starving people are often ill and may not have a good appetite. They will therefore languish in an emaciated state or get even sicker. Even someone well-nourished would fail to thrive on the monotonous diets of three or so commodities (e.g. wheat, beans and oil) that is all that is available, month in, month out, to many refugees and displaced people. And this is aside from the micro-nutrient deficiencies that often develop. This misconception starts, in part, from a failure to agree on explict objectives for food assistance -- which should surely be to provide for health, welfare, and a reasonably decent existence and help in attaining and acceptable state of self-reliance and self-respect.

This policy is incorrect and, with severely malnourished children, it can be fatal. Any child with diarrhoea must be fed, if necessary with a liquid diet by nasogastric tube, at the same time as additional fluids are given. Even if the diarrhoea is profuse, some nutrients are absorbed and can start the recovery process. To begin feeding after rehydration will often be too late. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-myths-and-realities-in-disaster-situations", "question": "Do refugees manage with less?", "answer": "This misconception dehumanizes the refugee. It implies that, once uprooted, he or she no longer has the basic human rights to food, shelter and care - that these are now offered as charitable acts and that refugees can (or should) make do on much less than non-refugees. In fact they will often need more than their normal food requirement at first if they have become malnourished and sick before arrival at a camp and need rehabilitation; and may suffer exposure from inadequate shelter. If the only food source is provided by camp organizers, these rations have to be adequate in all nutrients. This requires a mixed food basket, including fruits and vegetables. If this cannot be ensured then trading may have to be encouraged if refugees are not to become undernourished and deficient in micro-nutrients. The fact that some foods may be traded, to add variety to the diet, is no grounds for reducing the ration. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"}

{"topic": "/emergencies-myths-and-realities-in-disaster-situations", "question": "Is a standard ration suitable for all populations?", "answer": "The recommended per caput calorie output for a refugee population should vary according to demographic composition, nutritional and health status of the population (allowing for an extra \"catch-up\" allowance where people are malnourished), the activity level the intake is intended to support, environmental temperature, and likely wastage in the chain from supply of food in a country to its consumption by individuals. In other words there is a range of requirements for dietary energy, which will depend on the circumstances, and use of a single figure is likely to lead to either deficit or wastage. The figure of 1900 kcal (commonly assumed to be of general application) often underestimates what is needed. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-myths-and-realities-in-disaster-situations", "question": "Does energy adequacy mean nutritional adequacy?", "answer": "The diet needs to be adequate in both quantity and quality, meeting requirements for calories, protein, and micro-nutrients. Where refugees are completely dependent on the ration provided -- for example, in the early stages of an emergency or in closed camps, where trading for diversity cannot be ensured -- the ration must be designed to meet the requirements of all nutrients in full. Often, a ration is designed to meet minimum energy requirements and micro-nutrients are left to look after themselves. How micro-nutrient needs are to be met must be made explicit, especially when the ration provided is calculated on the basis of fully meeting energy needs. Foods should be diverse and palatable, and the special needs of weaning children must be met."}

{"topic": "/foodborne-diseases-global-burden", "question": "What are foodborne diseases?", "answer": "Foodborne diseases encompass a wide spectrum of illnesses and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are illnesses associated with the ingestion of food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites and chemicals as well as bio-toxins."}
{"topic": "/foodborne-diseases-global-burden", "question": "What are some examples of foodborne diseases?", "answer": "Foodborne diseases can be caused: by micro-organisms (e.g. salmonella, campylobacter, enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli, listeria, cholera); by parasites (e.g. fasciola, echinococcus, taenia solium); by chemical agents and bio-toxins such as: - naturally-occurring toxins (e.g. mycotoxins, which are toxins in fungi), - persistant organic pollutants (i.e. pollutants that accumulate in the environment and human bodies) ; - metals (which accumulate in food e.g. lead, mercury, cadmium); and - unconventional agents (e.g. the agent that caused bovine spongiform encephalopathy - also known as \"mad cow disease\")."}
{"topic": "/foodborne-diseases-global-burden", "question": "How widespread are foodborne diseases?", "answer": "Foodborne diseases are a widespread and growing public health problem, both in developed and developing countries. In 2000 the World Health Assembly recognized that the prevention and control of foodborne diseases is an important public health issue (resolution WHA53.15). While most foodborne diseases are sporadic and often not reported, foodborne disease outbreaks may take on massive proportions. For example, the current Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak in the United States affected 43 out of 50 states in the country. The melamine-contaminated dairy products in China affected over 54,000 children. The WHO Global Burden of Disease: Update 2004 has estimated that 2.16 million children die every year from diarrhoeal diseases as a result of exposure to unsafe water, food, and poor sanitation and hygiene. However the proportion of these deaths that is attributable to eating unsafe food is not currently known. Additionally, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition in infants and young children."}
{"topic": "/foodborne-diseases-global-burden", "question": "What is the situation regarding foodborne diseases in developed and developing countries?", "answer": "In some industrialized countries, the percentage of the population suffering from foodborne diseases each year is estimated to be up to 30%.  While less well documented, developing countries bear the brunt of the problem. People living in developing countries are more likely to be exposed to unhealthy environments through: Poor access to clean water to adequately wash food items Unsafe transportation and/or inadequate storage of foods Insufficient knowledge of safe food processing and handling practices Compromised immune responses to foodborne infections, particularly in populations where malnutrition and HIV/AIDS are prevalent This is compounded by poor countries' limited capacity to enforce effective food safety measures, including: Efficient foodborne disease surveillance and monitoring systems Food safety regulations and functioning inspection systems Food safety education programs and Effective emergency planning and relief. The high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in many developing countries, including those caused by parasites, points out the urgent need to prioritize foodborne disease prevention and control in national health and development plans. The full picture of the impact and costs of foodborne diseases - in industrial just as in developing countries - is to date unknown. Many foodborne disease outbreaks go unrecognized, unreported or uninvestigated and may only be visible if connected to situations that have a major public health or economic impact. In order to fill this current data vacuum, the WHO Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases (FOS) together with its partners launched the Initiative to Estimate the Global Burden of Foodborne Diseases."}
{"topic": "/foodborne-diseases-global-burden", "question": "How do foodborne diseases challenge public health security?", "answer": "Many recent developments have accelerated the spread of foodborne diseases worldwide: 1) In today’s interconnected and interdependent world, local foodborne disease outbreaks have become a potential threat to the entire globe. 2) Both accidentally and deliberately contaminated food products can affect the health of people in many countries at the same time, as well as causing considerable economic losses from lost production and trade embargoes, and damage to a country's tourist industry. 3) Foodborne diseases are not only spreading faster, they also appear to be emerging more rapidly than ever before1 and are able to circumvent conventional control measures. 4) The growing industrialization of food production catalyses the appearance and spread of new pathogens, as was the case for prions associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which led to new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. The increasing resistance of pathogens to antibiotics is also a major problem."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "What is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)?", "answer": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "What are the symptoms of MERS? How severe is it?", "answer": "A typical case of MERS includes fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, however some people infected with the MERS virus have been reported to be asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe cases of MERS can include respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive-care unit. Some patients have had organ failure, especially of the kidneys, or septic shock. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and people with chronic diseases as diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease. The mortality rate for people with the MERS virus is approximately 35% – this may be an overestimate however, as mild cases may be missed by existing surveillance systems."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "Is there a vaccine for MERS‐CoV? What is the treatment?", "answer": "No vaccine or specific treatment for MERS is currently available, however there are several vaccines for MERS in development. Treatment is supportive and based on a person’s clinical condition."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "Where have cases of MERS been identified?", "answer": "MERS has been reported in 27 countries since 2012, with approximately 80% of human cases reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Cases identified outside the Middle East are people who were infected in the Middle East and travelled to areas outside the Middle East.  On rare occasions, small outbreaks have occurred in areas outside the Middle East. For the latest information on MERS outbreaks please see: WHO Disease Outbreak News"}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "How do people get infected with the MERS virus?", "answer": "The MERS virus is transmitted primarily from infected dromedary camels to people, but transmission from people to people is also possible. From animals to people MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people.  Scientific evidence suggests that people are infected through unprotected direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. The MERS virus has been identified in dromedary camels in several countries, including Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mali, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Spain (Canary Islands), Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.. There is further evidence suggesting the MERS-CoV is widespread in dromedary camels in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. It is possible that other animal reservoirs exist, however animals including goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine, and wild birds have been tested for MERS-CoV and the virus has not been found. Between people The MERS virus does not pass easily between people unless there is close unprotected contact, such as the provision of clinical care to an infected patient without strict hygiene measures. Transmission between people has been limited to-date, and has been identified among family members, patients, and health care workers. The majority of reported MERS cases to date have occurred in health care settings."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "Can someone be infected with MERS-CoV and not be ill?", "answer": "Yes, infection with MERS-CoV can be asymptomatic. Infected people with no symptoms have been identified because they were tested for MERS-CoV during investigations among contacts of people known to be infected with MERS-CoV. The role of asymptomatic infected individuals in transmission is currently unknown and under investigation."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "Is it easy to detect people who are infected with MERS-CoV?", "answer": "It is not always possible to identify people infected with the MERS virus because early symptoms of the disease are non-specific. For this reason, all health care facilities should have standard infection prevention and control practices in place. It is also important to investigate the travel history of people with respiratory infection to determine if they have recently visited countries with active MERS-CoV circulation or have had contact with dromedary camels."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "What should a person do if she/he has contact with a person who has MERS?", "answer": "If you have had close contact with someone infected with MERS-CoV within the last 14 days without using the recommended infection control precautions, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?", "answer": "As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present should practice general hygiene measures. These include regular hand-washing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals. The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms. Animal products processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption, but should also be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments. Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Especially in the Middle East, this group of people should avoid contact with dromedary camels, consuming raw camel milk or camel urine, as well as eating meat that has not been properly cooked. Camel farm and slaughterhouse workers should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing, facial protection, and protective clothing (which should be removed after work and washed daily). Workers should also avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with camels or camel excretions. Sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption. People should avoid direct contact with any animal that has been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection."}
{"topic": "/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "question": "Are health care workers at risk from MERS‐CoV?", "answer": "Yes. Transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred in health care facilities in several countries, most notably in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea. It is not always possible to identify patients infected with MERS-CoV early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non-specific.\r\nFor this reason, it is important that health care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients. Droplet precautions should be added to standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for suspected or confirmed cases of MERS. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol‐generating procedures.

{"topic": "/who-s-role-in-emergencies", "question": "What is the role of WHO in emergencies?", "answer": "WHO is committed to saving lives and reducing suffering during times of crisis – whether caused by conflict, disease outbreak or a disaster. WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme is committed to working with Member States and other stakeholders so that suffering and death in crises are minimized and systems are protected and repaired. WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme provides the following services to countries: support of the assessment of country health emergency preparedness and development      of national plans to address critical capacity gaps; development of strategies and capacities to prevent and control high-threat infectious      hazards; and monitoring of new and ongoing public health events to assess, communicate and      recommend action for public health risks. In addition, WHO will work with countries and partners to: ensure readiness to diminish public health risks in countries with high      vulnerability; and provide life-saving health services to affected populations in countries with      ongoing emergencies."}
{"topic": "/who-s-role-in-emergencies", "question": "How can disaster risk reduction help save lives?", "answer": "Emergencies can happen in any country, at any time. When disaster strikes, it can seriously disrupt the functioning of a community and people will depend on help from the outside. But a lot can be done to prevent and reduce the effects of disasters as well as to strengthen the response of communities at risk. Countries with well-developed health systems and a well-trained, well-equipped health workforce in communities are much better prepared for disasters. When a community is well-prepared, many lives can be saved in the first hours after an emergency before external help arrives. The people in the community know local risks and their own needs best. To reduce future risks and human and material losses, WHO helps countries build resilience in health systems by strengthening emergency risk management, an approach which includes measures ranging from prevention to preparedness to response and recovery. Emergency risk management actions include: creating supportive national policies, strategies and allocating resources to manage risks; improving access to quality primary health care before disaster strikes, as well as in response and recovery; training and equipping the health workforce and including them in the planning for all types of emergencies; identifying hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities to assess risks; promoting risk awareness of emergencies and providing health education (e.g. sanitation and hygiene); providing early warning of emergencies to health providers and communities; and protecting health facilities from hazards and preparing for emergency health response."}
{"topic": "/who-s-role-in-emergencies", "question": "How does WHO work with partners in emergencies?", "answer": "The Health Emergencies Programme works with its partners to protect and save people’s lives in all health emergencies. During a crisis, WHO works with the local Ministry of Health and partners to identify where health needs are greatest and to coordinate the efforts of partner organizations to ensure that these areas are covered by both medical supplies and personnel. No organization can act alone in emergencies.

{"topic": "/who-s-role-in-emergencies", "question": "What is the Health Cluster?", "answer": "When emergencies occur, coordination is necessary. No one organization can respond to a health crisis alone. The Global Health Cluster is a platform for more than 900 organizations to work in partnership to ensure collective action results in a more timely, effective and predictable response to health emergencies. WHO is the IASC designated Cluster Lead Agency. The Global Health Cluster exists to support countries by: providing the right expertise at the right place at the right time; building the capacity of Health Cluster Coordinators; gathering and disseminating sound and relevant information to guide partners’ response; identifying and addressing gaps in technical knowledge and available guidance to ensure the health response follows global best practices and standards; and, promoting and advocating for the importance of humanitarian health action on the global stage, to help ensure that political and financial support is secured."}
{"topic": "/who-s-role-in-emergencies", "question": "Where does WHO get its funding for emergencies?", "answer": "Financing the work of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme includes core financing for baseline staff and activities at the 3 levels of the Programme, financing from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies, and financing for ongoing activities in acute and protracted emergencies through appeals guided by humanitarian response plans. The core budget is the funding WHO uses to implement the normative, technical, and operations-management capacities and activities reflected in the results framework for the Health Emergencies Programme. Funding for the core budget comes from 3 sources: Assessed contributions : The annual quotas paid by Member States to      support the work of the Organization. Core voluntary contributions : Flexible contributions made by Member      States and other donors that the Director-General may allocate at her      discretion and according to need.

The Olympic Games, The Hajj, and other major sporting, religious, and cultural events are all examples of a mass gathering. Mass gatherings may stretch health systems beyond their capacity; however, these events also present opportunities for long-lasting positive effects such as a stronger public health systems after the event, or residents and visitors that are better informed about how they can protect themselves from certain diseases."}
{"topic": "/what-is-who-s-role-in-mass-gatherings", "question": "What is WHO’s role in mass gatherings?", "answer": "WHO provides advice and technical support to host governments preparing for mass gathering events. The goal is to make large international events as safe as possible from public health risks and to encourage a positive public health legacy from these events. This includes lessons learnt for future mass gathering events and an improved health system in the host country. For example, WHO, PAHO and Public Health England, WHO Collaborating Centre in Mass Gatherings and Global Health Security, have been providing expertise to the government of Brazil on planning for mass gatherings since 2012, including the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and the Rio 2016 Games."}
{"topic": "/what-is-who-s-role-in-mass-gatherings", "question": "What kind of mass gatherings is WHO working on?", "answer": "WHO has provided public health assessments, guidance and advice for a range of cultural, religious and sports mass gatherings. For example, the WHO Office for the European Region provided advice and technical support to WHO Member States that hosted the London 2012 Olympic Games, the 2012 UEFA European Football Championships in Poland and Ukraine and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian Federation. WHO has also provided advice and technical support to Saudi Arabia for The Hajj, in particular with respect to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The Hajj is the largest annual recurring mass gathering event, which attracts roughly 10 million people from more than 180 countries across the globe."}
{"topic": "/what-is-who-s-role-in-mass-gatherings", "question": "How does WHO provide support to Member States for mass gatherings?", "answer": "To provide advice and technical support to Member States that are hosting mass gatherings, WHO draws on 5 WHO Collaborating Centres for Mass Gatherings and a Virtual Interdisciplinary Advisory Group (VIAG). VIAG is an informal network of mass gathering experts. Their role is to share expertise on public health requirements and best practices with any organization considering hosting a mass gathering event. Activities to support host governments of mass gatherings often include: Prior to the event: all-hazard risk assessment, travel medicine and activities to encourage increased physical activity, cessation of tobacco use and avoidance of excess alcohol. During the event: international monitoring of potential disease spread and risk assessment, emergency medical services and hospitals and plans to manage fan zones. After the event: capture lessons learnt and share expertise with future mass gathering hosts. For example, for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, WHO and other organizations helped the Department of Health of South Africa to design the reporting and oversight methodology for establishing health operations centres at the national and provincial level."}
{"topic": "/what-is-who-s-role-in-mass-gatherings", "question": "What governs WHO’s work on mass gatherings?", "answer": "WHO’s work on mass gatherings was strengthened by a 2011 decision of the WHO Executive Board and the International Health Regulations (2005). The decision states that the WHO \"Director-General should, where appropriate, work closely with Member States that are planning and conducting mass gatherings to support cooperation and communication between the concerned health authorities in each country, and help Member States strengthen capacities to better utilize the International Health Regulations (2005)\".

{"topic": "/what-is-who-s-role-in-mass-gatherings", "question": "Does WHO have the power to cancel or move mass gatherings?", "answer": "The decision to cancel, restrict, modify or proceed with any mass gathering event can only be made based on an event - and country-specific risk assessment conducted by the organizers of the event. WHO may provide advice and technical guidance to host countries on public health risks, but has no decision power to uphold, cancel or postpone mass gatherings hosted by Member States."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees", "question": "What are the International Health Regulations?", "answer": "The International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), represents a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees", "question": "How does the IHR Emergency Committee work?", "answer": "The Emergency Committee is made up of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) The Committee provides views on: whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC); the Temporary Recommendations that should be taken by the country experiencing an emergency of international concern, or by other countries, to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international trade and travel; and the termination of a PHEIC. The Director-General makes the final determination of a PHEIC and Temporary Recommendations to address the situation, based on advice from the Emergency Committee, information provided by the State Parties, scientific experts and an assessment of risk to human health, risk of international spread of disease and of risk of interference with international travel. Under the IHR (2005), Temporary Recommendations automatically expire three months after their issuance. Emergency Committees are therefore reconvened at least every 3 months to review the current epidemiological situation and to review whether the event continues to be a public health emergency of international concern and whether changes need to be made to the Temporary Recommendations. A statement of the Emergency Committee meeting is published on the WHO website after each meeting of the Committee."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees", "question": "What is a public health emergency of international concern?", "answer": "A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. This definition implies a situation that is: serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; and may require immediate international action."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees", "question": "Who are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee?", "answer": "Members of an IHR Emergency Committee are drawn from the IHR Experts Roster, established by the Director-General, and, where appropriate, from other WHO expert advisory panels. The IHR Expert Roster is composed of international experts in fields such as disease control, virology, vaccine development or infectious disease epidemiology. Members can be selected on the basis of expertise required for any particular session. At least 1 member of the Emergency Committee should be an expert nominated by a State Party within whose territory the event arises. These States Parties are invited to present their views to the Emergency Committee. The Director-General may also appoint 1 or more technical experts to advise the Committee, on his or her own initiative or at the request of the Committee. Persons who are neither members of the IHR Experts Roster nor other WHO Expert Advisory Panels could be appointed as technical experts to advise the Committee, but not as members of the Committee. The names of members and advisers to an IHR Emergency Committee, their job titles and any other information that could be determined to be a potential conflict of interest are published on WHO’s website."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees", "question": "How are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee chosen?", "answer": "Selection of members is based primarily on their technical ability and experience in the relevant fields of expertise. The Director-General aims to ensure that members of the IHR Emergency Committee have the broadest possible geographical representation and reflect diverse knowledge, practical experience and approaches. Achieving gender balance is also a desirable aim. Members of WHO advisory panels and committees do not receive any remuneration from the Organization."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-international-health-regulations-and-emergency-committees", "question": "How are people appointed to the expert advisory panels?", "answer": "A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the DG. An expert advisory panel may be established by the DG in any field, as and when required by the development of the Organization’s programme. Any person possessing qualifications and/or experience relevant and useful to the activities of the Organization in a field covered by an established expert advisory panel may be considered for appointment as a member of that panel – after consultations with the national authorities concerned."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "What is the role of WHO in crises?", "answer": "The primary objective in an emergency, whether natural or human-made, is to reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability.

WHO is committed to working better with Member States and other stakeholders so that suffering and death in crises are minimized and systems are protected and repaired. We want to help national authorities and communities to: Prepare for crises by strengthening their overall capacity to manage all types of crises; Mitigate against the effects of crises by taking measures to reduce the effects of disasters and crises on systems that support good public health; Respond to crises by ensuring effective, efficient and timely action to address public health priorities so that lives are saved and suffering is reduced; Recover from crises by ensuring that the local health system is back to functioning. During crises, humanitarian health partners, led by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Health Custer under the leadership of WHO will empower humanitarian country teams to better address the health aspects and crises. At all levels of WHO, whether it be in Country Offices, Regional Offices, and headquarters, the WHO network for Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response serves as a convener and conduit. It provides information and services, and mobilizes partners to agree on standards and courses of action."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "Where is it possible to find information on WHO in crises?", "answer": "The easiest way to find information is to consult the web page www.who.int/disasters.

{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "What is the Humanitarian Reform and how does it affect WHO’s work?", "answer": "The reform process, started in 2005 with the Humanitarian Response Review, represents a considerable change in the international scene and has vast implications for the work of WHO. The Humanitarian Reform is underpinned by three pillars: Improving the predictability of funding through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF); Coordinating effective response through the Cluster Approach, and Strengthening the Humanitarian Coordinator System. The three pillars of humanitarian reform are secured by a foundation of strong and collaborative partnerships. Strengthening commitment to coordination at the field level by all humanitarian partners is another pillar of the humanitarian reform process. The IASC self-assessment of the cluster roll-out brought to the fore that humanitarian coordination operations are very much related to the success of inter-cluster relations and efficient cluster roll-out. The two agendas converge. WHO chairs the IASC Humanitarian Coordinators Training Core Group set up to fill an existing gap and improve the ability of the Emergency Relief Coordinator to propose for HC position individuals whose skills, performance and background meet the expectations of leadership and experience of the IASC."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "What is the Health Cluster?", "answer": "When emergencies occur, coordination is necessary. No one organization can respond to a health crisis alone. The Global Health Cluster is a platform for organizations to work in partnership to ensure collective action results in more timely, effective and predictable response to health emergencies. WHO is the Cluster Lead Agency. There are over 900 partners at country level of which 56 partners engage strategically at global level. Currently there are 30 Health Clusters/Sectors, of which 2 are regional coordination mechanisms. These Health Clusters are working to meet the health needs of approximately 68 million people worldwide. The Global Health Cluster exists to support Health Clusters countries, and it can make a difference by: providing the right expertise at the right place at the right time; building the capacity of Health Cluster Coordinators; gathering and disseminating sound and relevant information to guide partners’ response; identifying and addressing gaps in technical knowledge and available guidance to ensure the health response follows global best practices and standards; and, promoting and advocating for the importance of humanitarian health action on the global stage, to help ensure that Health Clusters receive the political and financial support they need. The cluster approach was developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee as part of the humanitarian reform in 2005, to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian response by building partnerships. Clusters are groups of humanitarian organizations, both UN and non-UN, in each of the main sectors of humanitarian action (e.g. water, health and logistics) with clear responsibilities for coordination. The aim of the cluster approach is to strengthen system-wide preparedness and technical capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies by ensuring that there is predictable leadership and by enhancing the accountability and transparency of humanitarian response.

{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "What is the impact of the Central Emergency Response Fund on WHO’s work?", "answer": "The CERF is a United Nations emergency relief fund officially launched on 9 March 2006 by the Secretary-General. In December 2006, pledges to the CERF totalled US$345 million. The objective of the CERF is to provide urgent and effective humanitarian aid to regions threatened by, or experiencing, a humanitarian crisis, and UN agencies and their partners can access the funds within the crucial first 72 hours of a crisis. The CERF has immediately become an essential funding mechanism of WHO’s emergency work. In 2006, CERF grants represented 24% of the funds channelled through WHO’s Health Action in Crises, i.e. more than $24 million, of which $14 million were for rapid response operations and $10.4 million for under-funded emergencies."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "The Foundations: partnerships", "answer": "The Inter-Agency Standing Committee – Established in June 1992 with the purpose to strengthen humanitarian assistance, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) is a unique inter-agency forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making involving the key UN and non-UN humanitarian partners. Under the leadership of the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the IASC develops humanitarian policies, agrees on a clear division of responsibility for the various aspects of humanitarian assistance, identifies and addresses gaps in response, and advocates for effective application of humanitarian principles. WHO is represented in the IASC by its Director-General. The Global Humanitarian Platform – In July 2006, UN agencies, NGOs, the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, the IOM, and World Bank agreed to convene a forum (GHP) and bring together the three main families of the humanitarian community. The GHP aims at enhancing effective humanitarian action by maximizing the complementarity of different mandates. The GHP will develop “Principles of Partnership”, which will include diversity, mutual respect, responsibility, and transparency, and support their implementation at country level. The GHD agenda privileges a) accountability to the beneficiary populations, b) the capacity of local actors; c) safety and security of humanitarian staff; and d) situations of transition. The GHP meets annually and a Steering Committee oversees the process and sets the strategic directions."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "What is WHO’s role within the humanitarian framework?", "answer": "In order to advocate for humanitarian health action in crises, WHO participates in the annual humanitarian segment of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) which allows for substantial debates with all stakeholders involved in humanitarian assistance and for keeping health high on the political/humanitarian agenda. Also, to bring health action in crises to the forefront of humanitarian action and contribute to inter-agency coordination, WHO works with the UN Department for the Coordination of Humanitarian Action (OCHA), the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and other initiatives and entities as relevant. WHO, as a member of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG), is an active player in processes of joint assessments and planning for recovery and reconstruction conducted by the UN and the World Bank. WHO is also part of the United Nations Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs (ECHA) which meets on a monthly basis to ensure health as an important component of humanitarian action. To ensure an adequate representation of health needs in the Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP), WHO provides input on the Consolidated Appeals, Common Humanitarian Action Plans (CHAP) and Flash Appeals."}

{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "Does WHO have partnerships with non-UN organizations?", "answer": "Outside the UN framework, WHO co-operates with a wide network of humanitarian partners worldwide, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, Collaborating Centres, universities and other academic institutions, NGOs and senior public health experts. Other key partners are Inter-Governmental institutions such as the African Union, the Council of Europe and the International Organization of Civil Protection. For instance, In May 2005, IFRC and WHO signed a Joint Letter of Collaboration to further enhance collaboration between Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and national health authorities. Collaborating centres are scientific or academic institutions which have expertise and facilities in specific aspects of emergency preparedness and response, including training and research to field operations. Their expertise spans disaster reduction, technological emergencies, hospital mitigation, critical incident management, disaster medicine, complex emergencies, emergency communications and information management."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-humanitarian-health-action", "question": "Where does WHO get its funding for crises?", "answer": "Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response departments' budget is approved by the World Health Assembly biannually. The budget for the 2008-2009 biennium amounts to USD 218 million, 67% higher than the previous biennium.

Voluntary contributions come from different sources: Bilateral contributions from Member States earmarked for specific emergencies; Unearmarked bilateral contributions from Member States; Allocations from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund; Allocations from trust funds and humanitarian pooled funds; Funds from foundations and health partners."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Do dead bodies cause epidemics?", "answer": "No, dead bodies from natural disasters generally do not cause epidemics. This is because victims of such disasters usually die from trauma, drowning or fire and do not normally harbour organisms which cause epidemics. The exception to this is when deaths have occurred from highly infectious diseases (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, cholera), or when the disaster occurred in an area that is endemic for such highly infectious diseases. In these circumstances, the possibility of disease spreading from dead bodies exists."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "What are the health risks for the public?", "answer": "Unless the deceased has died from a highly infectious disease, the risk to the public is negligible. However, there is a risk of diarrhoea from drinking water contaminated by faecal material from dead bodies. Routine disinfection of drinking water is sufficient to prevent waterborne illness. (See question 6 for the health risks to those handling dead bodies)."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Can dead bodies contaminate water?", "answer": "Yes, they can, as do live bodies. Dead bodies often leak faeces which may contaminate rivers or other water sources, causing a risk of diarrhoeal illness which adequate treatment of water can prevent."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Is spraying bodies with disinfectant or lime powder useful?", "answer": "Lime powder does not hasten decomposition and, since dead bodies are generally not an infectious risk to the public, disinfectant is not needed."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Local officials and journalists say there is a risk to the public of disease from dead bodies. Are they correct?", "answer": "The risk from dead bodies after disasters due to natural hazards is misunderstood by many professionals and the media. Even local or international health workers are often misinformed and contribute to the spread of unfounded rumours about outbreaks and epidemics. Dead bodies from natural disasters generally do not cause epidemics. The risk of disease from dead bodies is real only in cases where the deceased has died of a highly infectious disease or has died in an area where such infectious disease is endemic. Even then, the risk of disease transmission to a trained body-handler is low (see question 6)"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Is there a risk for those handling dead bodies?", "answer": "For people handling dead bodies (rescue workers, mortuary workers, etc.), there is a risk if the deceased are infected with highly infectious disease (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, cholera). The infectious agents responsible for these diseases last for varying periods after death. The internal organs that harbour organisms such as tuberculosis, which can survive for very long periods after a person’s death, are usually handled only by trained personnel during an actual autopsy. This is not part of any procedure described in this manual. Processes to support persons handling the dead should be in place to deal with any psychological impacts arising from their work."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Should workers wear a mask?", "answer": "The smell from decaying bodies is unpleasant, but the smell itself is not a health risk in well-ventilated areas, and in such areas wearing a mask is not generally required for health reasons. However, special masks may be required for health and safety purposes in some circumstances, including in the presence of toxic gases, smoke, particles, etc."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "What should the authorities do with dead bodies in the short term?", "answer": "Dead bodies should be collected and stored, using refrigerated containers where possible, or temporary burial. The simple steps required to help identify all the dead bodies should be taken. Photographs should be taken and descriptive information recorded for each body. Remains should be stored or buried temporarily to allow for the possibility of an expert forensic investigation in the future."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "Should mass graves be used to speed up the disposal of dead bodies?", "answer": "The rapid mass burial of victims on public health grounds is not justified. Rushing to dispose of bodies without having taken photographs and relevant information from them, and without keeping track of the location of each body, traumatizes families and communities. If these simple steps to identify the greatest possible number of bodies are taken, serious social and legal consequences for families can be avoided. In exceptional circumstances, the use of communal graves as a form of temporary traceable storage and protection of dead bodies is acceptable if properly managed."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "How urgent is the collection of dead bodies?", "answer": "Body collection is not the most urgent task after a disaster from natural hazards. The priority is to rescue and care for survivors. Nevertheless, bodies should be collected and photographed as soon as possible (and preferably before decomposition has commenced), basic information about the bodies should be collected and recorded, unique body codes allocated, and the bodies should be temporarily stored to protect them and to assist possible identification. The earlier this is done, the greater the number of bodies which will be identified. In the presence of an epidemic of highly infectious disease, collection and proper management of dead bodies by trained personnel is an urgent priority."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "What are the minimum steps needed to identify as many dead bodies as possible?", "answer": "Identifying dead bodies following disasters can be complex. The minimum steps needed to identify as many dead bodies as possible are set out in the Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters manual. In general terms, identifying a dead body is done by comparing information about the person while alive with information about the dead body. Thus, information about those who are missing or presumed to be dead is needed (a list of the missing, and specific individual information about each missing person). Also, information about the dead body is needed (photographs, preferably taken before decomposition has started, and information about identifying features, clothing and personal effects). To keep track of this information, the body needs to be given a unique code which must be in all the photographs, and on all the information collected; and attached to the body and the body bag, and any burial site, so that its location can be recorded, and the body retrieved at any time. Ideally, forensic experts should be involved, but this is not always possible."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "What are the potential mental health issues for the bereaved?", "answer": "The overwhelming desire of relatives (from all religions and cultures) is to identify their loved ones. All efforts to identify the bodies will help. Grieving and traditional individual burial (or other means of disposal of the body) are important factors for the personal and communal recovery or healing process. In the case of epidemics, traditional burial rites may not be appropriate because of the health risks involved. The psychological issues arising from this must be taken into consideration."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "How should bodies of foreigners be managed?", "answer": "Overseas families of visitors killed in a disaster, just like local families, will be hoping their loved one is identified, and the body is returned to them. Proper identification has family, social, economic and diplomatic implications. The simple steps required (allocation of a unique body code, photographs, data from the dead bodies collected and stored) will maximize the number of foreigners identified. Foreign consulates and embassies should be informed, and other relevant agencies (ICRC, Interpol, etc.) should be contacted for assistance."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "I am a volunteer: how can I help?", "answer": "To be helpful you could promote the proper recovery and management of dead bodies and assist in recording the necessary information. You could also assist with the recovery and disposal of the dead, under the direction of a recognized coordinating authority. However, you would first need to be briefed, advised, trained, equipped and supported for this difficult task. The field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters should be the framework for your participation."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "I represent an NGO: how can I help?", "answer": "Providing support for families and collecting information in collaboration with the coordinating authority will best help the surviving relatives. You may also promote proper identification and treatment of the dead, including through dissemination of the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters . NGOs should not be asked to manage the dead unless they are trained for this task and work for and under the direct supervision of a legal authority. Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters: A Field Manual for First Responders Second Edition"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "I am a health professional: how can I help?", "answer": "The survivors need you more than the dead. Any professional help in fighting the myth of epidemics caused by dead bodies will be appreciated. Talk about this with your colleagues and representatives of the media referencing the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-management-of-dead-bodies", "question": "I am a journalist: how can I help?", "answer": "If you hear comments or statements regarding the need for mass burial or incineration of bodies to avoid epidemics, challenge them. Promote an understanding of the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters, including by referring to it in your reports. If necessary, do not hesitate to consult the appropriate persons at WHO, PAHO, ICRC, IFRC or the local Red Cross/Red Crescent office."}
{"topic": "/yaws", "question": "What is yaws?", "answer": "Yaws is a poverty-related chronic skin disease that affects mainly children below 15 years of age (with a peak between 6 and 10 years). Yaws forms part of a group of chronic bacterial infections commonly known as the endemic treponematoses. These diseases are caused by spiral bacteria of the genus Treponema, which also includes endemic syphilis (bejel) and pinta. Yaws is the most common of these three infections. It is caused by the bacterium - is a Treponema pallidum m subspecies pertenue and transmitted by skin contact. Yaws mainly affects the skin, but can also involve the bone and cartilage. The organism that causes yaws is closely related to the one that causes syphilis. Early detection and treatment can avoid gross disfigurement and disability which occur in about 10% of cases."}
{"topic": "/yaws", "question": "Where does yaws occur?", "answer": "Yaws occurs in overcrowded communities, with limited access to basic amenities, such as water and sanitation, as well as health care. Yaws primarily affects children aged under 15 years who live in poor communities in warm, humid and tropical forested areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific islands."}
{"topic": "/yaws", "question": "How is yaws diagnosed?", "answer": "Traditionally, laboratory-based serological tests such as Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (for example, syphilis and yaws). These tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis however, and the interpretation of results from these tests in adults who live in yaws endemic areas needs careful clinical assessment because of syphillis. Rapid point-of-care tests that can be used in the field are widely available. However, most of them are treponemal-based and cannot distinguish between past and current infection. Recently dual treponemal and nontreponemal rapid tests have become available, thus simplifying diagnosis in the field. These tests are able to detect both present and past infections to guide treatment of people with active infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the organisms in the skin lesions. It can also be used to monitor azithromycin resistance and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme."}
{"topic": "/yaws", "question": "How can yaws be treated?", "answer": "Yaws is cured with a single oral dose of either of 2 antibiotics – azithromycin or benzathine penicillin. Azithromycin (single oral dose) at 30 mg/kg (maximum 2 gm) is the preferred choice in the WHO \" Yaws Eradication Strategy \" (the Morges Strategy) because of the ease of administration and logistical consideration in large-scale treatment campaigns. Benzathine penicillin (single intramuscular dose) at 1.2 million units (adults) and 600 000 units (children). For patients allergic to penicillin and azithromycin, doxycycline 100mg (1 tab) orally, b.d. twice daily for 7 days may be used."}
{"topic": "/yaws", "question": "How can yaws be prevented?", "answer": "There is no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improvement in personal hygiene are essential components to reduce transmission of the disease. Contacts of patients with yaws should receive empiric treatment."}

{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "What are substandard and falsified medical products?", "answer": "Substandard and falsified (SF) medical products are medicines, devices and other products manufactured to imitate or replace similar certified products. They may \ncontain no active ingredient, the wrong active ingredient or the wrong \namount of the correct active ingredient. They are also found to commonly contain corn starch, potato starch or chalk. Some substandard and falsified medical products have been toxic in\n nature with either fatal levels of the wrong active ingredient or other\n toxic chemicals. Substandard and falsified medical products are often produced in \nvery poor and unhygienic conditions by unqualified personnel, and \ncontain unknown impurities and are sometimes contaminated with bacteria."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "How big is the problem of SF medical products?", "answer": "SF medical products are by their very nature difficult to detect. They are often designed to appear identical to the genuine product and may not cause an obvious adverse reaction, however they will fail to properly treat the disease or condition for which they were intended. There are many estimates of the scope and scale of the market in SF medical products but little validated evidence to underpin those estimates. WHO have withdrawn all of their previous estimations of the scale of the problem and in 2013 launched a global surveillance and monitoring system to encourage Member States to report SF incidents in a structured and systematic format, to assist in arriving at a more accurate and validated assessment of the scope, scale and harm caused by this issue. Medical products have so far been reported representing all main therapeutic categories and representing both innovator and generic medicines. In November 2017, WHO launched two important publications; WHO Global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products , which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions. Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products , which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue; Both publications provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "Which medical products are most affected?", "answer": "Reports received by WHO from Member States suggest that all therapeutic categories are affected by SF medical products. Anti-infectives, anti-malarials and genito urinary/sex hormones are particularly badly affected. Expensive cardio vascular and oncology products are targeted as well as low priced pain suppressants. Generic and innovator medical products are both vulnerable to falsification as are the most expensive to the cheapest products. Those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have shown they respond quickly to demand, thoroughly understand the market and are fast to exploit opportunities."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "Where do SF medical products come from?", "answer": "SF medical products are manufactured in many different countries and in all WHO regions. Member States and the media frequently report successful operations against manufacturers of SF medical products. Some reports refer to large scale manufacturing and others to small back street operations. With the availability of tableting machines, ovens, specialist equipment, ingredients and packaging materials, clandestine manufacturing facilities are quick and easy to assemble and have been discovered in all regions."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "Which countries are affected the most?", "answer": "No countries remain untouched by this issue and work is being done in all WHO Regions. What was once considered a problem suffered by developing and low income countries has now become an issue for all. With the exponential increase in internet connectivity those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have gained access to a global market place. This extends both to consumers and business to business forums. A culture of self-diagnosis and self-prescribing has led to the emergence of thousands of unregulated websites providing unsupervised access to SF medical products. However it is low and middle income countries and those in areas of conflict, or civil unrest, with very weak or non-existent health systems that bear the greatest burden of SF medical products."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "What is the harm caused by SF medical products?", "answer": "Assessing the harm caused by SF medical products is complex and difficult. Most cases involve a medical product that fails to work properly. Often the product will not cause a toxic reaction, but will fail to treat the condition for which it was intended, with potentially devastating consequences. A patient failing to respond to their anti-malarial or who suffers an unwanted pregnancy will rarely consider the cause of the problem to be their medicine. Effective vigilance and awareness amongst healthcare professionals, efficient reporting mechanisms for patients as well as strong post market surveillance of medical products in circulation are needed in order to quickly identify problems. Some SF medical products do cause serious adverse reactions and sometimes fatalities. When these incidents occur in a close geographic area over a short time period they are more easily identified and reported. Cases are reported to WHO arising from an unexpected and disproportionate rise in mortality at healthcare facilities. The WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System and other WHO vigilance systems pick up these data. In November 2017, two important WHO publications were launched: WHO global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions. Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue; Both publications will provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "How do SF medical products enter the supply chain?", "answer": "Most commonly, SF medical products enter the legal supply chain at distribution level through hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and wholesalers, who have obtained medical products from unknown sources and intermediaries without checking their credentials or conducting any due diligence. Supply chains can be long and complex. The more extended the supply chain, the more vulnerable they are to weak links and the insertion of SF medical products. SF medical products are frequently found in unlicensed and illegal outlets, this includes street markets, hawkers and illegal internet pharmacies. However, they are also reported from legal and regulated venues such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and drug stores in all regions. These are precisely the locations where patients should have the highest degree of confidence that the medical products they receive are safe, good quality and effective."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "Are deterrents strong enough?", "answer": "Many countries have started to strengthen their legislation in respect of substandard and falsified (SF) medical products and specifically intentionally falsified medical products. Traditionally sanctions have been weak and remain so in many countries. Strong legislation alone is not enough, criminal justice systems need to be willing to handle these types of cases in an effective and efficient manner. National medicines regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies need to collaborate and awareness raising is required amongst the prosecutors and the judiciary. Many investigations concerning SF medical products are international in nature. This makes gathering evidence more complex. Countries need to have in place mutual legal assistance treaties to permit gathering of evidence from other jurisdictions to support prosecutions. Member States with legal powers to restrain and confiscate assets and recover the proceeds of criminal activity have met with some success. Especially if laws allow for a proportion of the seized assets to be reinvested in purchasing detection devices and laboratory equipment or finance awareness campaigns and training events. In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high profit activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "Is organised crime involved in SF medical products?", "answer": "Some of those involved in the manufacture, distribution and supply of spurious, falsified and counterfeit medical products have access to sophisticated networks of off shore companies to facilitate the movement of the products, off shore bank accounts to launder the proceeds and flexible freight networks to ship the products to their eventual destinations. They operate a highly organised, professional, lucrative and criminal business. Others involved are relatively disorganised with small illegal manufacturing sites and local distribution. In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high return activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity."}
{"topic": "/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products-scope-scale-and-harm", "question": "Is there a need for international law about these products?", "answer": "The manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a global issue. With the globalization of the pharmaceutical sector and wide access to internet and communications technologies, no single country or organization can hope to effectively tackle the problem in isolation. Some aspects of the issue require a regulatory response, others a criminal law response, but most require international collaboration. Many countries rely on existing mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties and co-operative arrangements, others do not have those facilities available. Having an effective regulatory and criminal legal framework in place at the national level, with dissuasive sanctions, is the first step towards preventing the proliferation of SF medical products. However, in addition to legislation an efficient investigative process and transparent criminal justice system is required to ensure the proportionate application of the law. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have carried out some work on developing a legislative framework in relation to this topic focusing on fraudulent medicine. The Council of Europe have drafted the Medicrime convention, which constitutes a binding International Instrument in the field of criminal law on the counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes involving threats to public health."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "How many snakebites occur each year, and how many injuries/fatalities result from them?", "answer": "It is very difficult to determine the number of snakebites that occur worldwide, but the best available evidence suggests that each year as many as 2.7 million people develop a clinical illness following a bite from a venomous snake. In the field of clinical toxinology, which studies snakebite and other illnesses caused by venomous and/or poisonous organisms, the term used for such an injury is “envenoming” (American “envenomation”), and patients suffering the effects of venomous snake bite are said to have been “envenomed”. Of the 2.7 million people envenomed each year, between 81,000 and 138,000 die as a result, and as many as 400 000 of the survivors are left permanently disabled."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "What makes snakebite a “neglected tropical disease”?", "answer": "There are four primary criteria that define an illness as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), and snakebite envenoming satisfies each of them: First, there is a significant burden of mortality and morbidity (as detailed in the answer to question 1) – snakebite envenoming is a high-impact disease. Secondly, a majority of incidents of snakebite occur in the world’s tropical and sub-tropical regions, and it particularly impacts the poor – snakebite is a tropical disease. Thirdly, snakebite is amenable to treatment, as well as prevention – the impact of snakebite can be mitigated now if we make the effort to do so. Finally, the overall level of investment in research addressing snakebite, from prevention to diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, is exceptionally low in comparison to its impact – snakebite is a neglected disease."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "Where in the world do the most bites occur?", "answer": "The majority of snakebite envenoming cases occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the developing world. As many as 46 000 snakebite deaths happen in India alone; sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia, New Guinea, and Central and South America are also snakebite hot spots. Underscoring the fact that snakebite is a disease of the developing world are the incredible statistics from Australasia – although Australia itself is world famous for its diversity of highly venomous organisms, on average only 2 people die from snakebite there each year. In nearby New Guinea, on the other hand, an almost identical snake fauna (with, if anything, a lesser diversity of venomous species) claims more than 1000 lives each year. This is largely due to the differing socioeconomic and development levels of the two countries, and emphasizes the greater impact of snakebite envenoming in poor, less-developed communities."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "Who is most impacted by snakebite?", "answer": "Like most NTDs, snakebite affects particularly the poorest members of society. Agricultural workers (including working children aged 10–14 years) and people living in poorly constructed homes face the highest risk and often have limited access to education, health care and even footwear. When poor people are bitten, the luxury of modern health care is usually far removed from their reality."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "What are the socioeconomic consequences of snakebite?", "answer": "The socioeconomic impacts of snakebite for survivors and their families can be dire. In rural India, where 75% of people live on average monthly household incomes of just 5000 rupees (US$ 78), immediate treatment costs after snakebites of more than 350 000 rupees (US$ 5400) have been reported. The follow-on economic losses, due to loss of income or being forced to sell livestock, homes or land in order to meet additional costs, can be as high as 400 000 rupees (US$ 6215). Elsewhere in the developing world, the story is similar: those lucky enough to survive a venomous snakebite are often financially crippled by the cost of treatment, as well as physically crippled by the effects of the venom. Given that a majority of bite sufferers are among the most productive members of society (young, working age men and women), disablement following snakebite can prevent survivors from earning an income, making them a lifelong financial burden for their family members. In addition, snakebite survivors may suffer disfigurement and post-traumatic stress disorder, which can result in their becoming social pariahs."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "Which species of snakes are responsible?", "answer": "The snake species implicated in serious snakebite injury vary from region to region, a fact that increases the challenge of mitigating the burden of snakebite worldwide. In India, the “big four” species are the Indian cobra ( Naja naja ), the Russell’s viper ( Daboia russelii ), the Indian saw-scaled viper ( Echis carinatus ) and the Indian krait ( Bungarus caeruleus ), although other species are also implicated in many life-threatening bites. Throughout the rest of tropical Asia, a similar cohort of culprits occurs, and cobras ( Naja ssp.), kraits ( Bungarus ssp.) and Russell’s vipers (where they occur) are responsible for the lion’s share of serious bites. In Africa, different types of cobras ( Naja ssp.), multiple species of saw-scaled/carpet viper ( Echis ssp.), and puff adders ( Bitis arietans ) are major culprits, although in some areas mambas ( Dendroaspis ssp.) are also responsible for numerous bites, along with other species of viper (particularly other members of the genus Bitis ). In Central and South America, a range of pit-viper species, particularly lanceheads (genus Bothrops and related genera) and rattlesnakes (genus Crotalus ) are responsible for the most bites, although coral snakes (genus Micrurus ) are common in some areas and capable of inflicting life-threatening envenomations. In New Guinea, the taipan ( Oxyuranus scutellatus ) is responsible for the most bites, followed by the death adders ( Acanthophis spp.) – both groups of snakes occur also in parts of Australia, but bites in that country are very rare."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "How can snakebite be prevented?", "answer": "It is often said that prevention is better than cure, and a majority of snakebite accidents are readily preventable. In many parts of the world where snakebite envenoming is very common, walking barefoot through snake-infested areas is a major cause of snakebite and as many as 80% of all snakebites occur on the legs or feet, below the knee. These could be prevented if people had access to cheap, practical and protective footwear, and were educated to understand the importance of wearing their shoes. Snakes are typically shy creatures that spend most of their time hiding, and piles of human rubbish and old construction materials make perfect shelter sites. Cleaning up and keeping the grass short in areas in close proximity to dwellings, along pathways, and in places where children play, are measures that can reduce the likelihood of snakebites. Similarly using a light when walking outside at night is essential in areas where some snakes forage after dark. Even the short walk from the house to an outdoor latrine can be fatal if you step on a snake in the dark. Many homes in areas where snakebite is endemic are constructed in such a way that snakes can gain access. Sealing houses so that snakes cannot enter the dwelling can help to prevent snakebites, but if this is not possible, the simple act of sleeping on a raised platform with a well-tucked in mosquito net can prevent not only mosquito-borne diseases but also snakebites."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "What is the appropriate first aid for snakebite?", "answer": "Most of the methods currently proposed as first aid for snakebites are either ineffective, dangerous, or delay proper medical treatment. Even methods that have been recommended by medical authorities in one part of the world may not be appropriate for use in other places because of the differences in the types of effects that different snake venoms can have. Methods such as the use of narrow tourniquets, excision or incision of the wounds or the affected limb, the use of chemicals such as potassium permanganate or the application of heated glass containers to produce suction, can all be dangerous as well as ineffective and should not be used. Other types of first aid, such as the use of the Belgian black stone, are simply ineffective and waste valuable time. The best approach is to immobilize the bitten person and keep them from moving around at all. The application of pressure at the bite-site via a pressure pad, a compression bandage applied to the bitten limb, or both, may be effective in delaying the onset of systemic effects, but is only recommended for bites from snakes with predominantly neurotoxic venom, and not for those that cause significant local tissue damage. Place envenomed patients on a makeshift stretcher and transport them to medical care without delay. If possible place them on their side to help protect their airway and breathing."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "What effective treatments exist for snakebite?", "answer": "Administration of the appropriate antivenom is the most effective treatment for life-threatening snakebite. The best response to antivenom is likely when it is administered as soon as possible following a bite, as many of the effects of snake venom are irreversible, including some neurotoxic, cytotoxic, haemorrhagic and haemotoxic effects. Snake venoms are also highly variable in their toxic components and effects. This variation exists not only among species but often also within a single species among geographical regions, age and size classes, or between the sexes. As a result, antivenom raised against the venom of one species or population may not be effective in the treatment of envenoming by snakes from other species or even other populations of the same species. There are often barriers that complicate the task of ensuring early access to appropriate antivenom to snakebite victims, including lack of appropriate transport networks in developing countries, lack of unbroken cold chain-based distribution systems that can maintain the integrity of antivenom (which may require refrigeration) in rural and remote areas, and general lack of infrastructure associated with healthcare facilities. Surmounting these challenges is essential to effective control of snakebite envenoming."}
{"topic": "/snakebite-envenoming", "question": "What can we do to mitigate the impacts of snakebite?", "answer": "Reducing the burden of snakebite in the tropical developing world is a massive task, with many complicating factors, some of which have been detailed above. The first step is securing the requisite resources via commitments from WHO Member States, donors and other funding bodies. Supporting the development of functional health systems and other infrastructure in the worst affected regions will not only help reduce the number of snakebite casualties, but contribute to the capacity to fight the myriad other diseases that afflict these areas. Education, both about the prevention of snakebite, and about appropriate treatment in the event of an accident, is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Increased investment in research that can deliver tangible and sustainable solutions is essential, particularly with respect to developing and rolling out better diagnostic tools and therapeutic treatments, and improved control tools and strategies. As with other NTDs, snakebite is a complex disease with many factors that contribute to its overall impact – mitigating these impacts requires commitment from multiple stakeholders."}
{"topic": "/dracunculiasis-(guinea-worm-disease)", "question": "What is guinea worm? Is it a real worm?", "answer": "Guinea worm is, in fact, a real worm. It is a large nematode, Dracunculus medinensis , which is ingested through drinking contaminated water.  This worm is the largest of the tissue parasite affecting humans. The adult female, which carries about 3 million embryos, can measure 600 to 800 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter. The parasite migrates through the victim's subcutaneous tissues causing severe pain especially when it occurs in the joints. The worm eventually emerges (from the feet in most of the cases), causing an intensely painful oedema, a blister and an ulcer accompanied by fever, nausea and vomiting."}
{"topic": "/dracunculiasis-(guinea-worm-disease)", "question": "How does Guinea-worm disease spread?", "answer": "Infected persons try to relieve the burning sensation by immersing the infected part of their body in local water sources, usually ponds. This also induces a contraction of the female worm at the base of the ulcer causing the sudden expulsion of hundreds of thousands of first stage larvae into the water. They move actively in the water, where they can live for a few days. For further development, these larvae need to be ingested by suitable species of voracious predatory crustacean, Cyclops or water fleas which measure 1–2 mm and are abundant worldwide. In the cyclops , larvae develop to the infective third-stage in 14 days at 26°C. When a person drinks contaminated water from ponds or shallow open wells, the cyclops is dissolved by the gastric acid of the stomach and the larvae are released and migrate through the intestinal wall. After 100 days, the male and female meet and mate. The male becomes encapsulated and dies in the tissues while the female moves down the muscle planes. After about one year of the infection, the female worm emerges, usually from the feet, releasing thousands of larvae and thus repeating the life cycle."}
{"topic": "/dracunculiasis-(guinea-worm-disease)", "question": "How can Guinea-worm disease be prevented?", "answer": "Several measures should be followed to curtail transmission of the disease: Effective surveillance to detect all cases within 24 hours of worm emergence and containment of all cases; Ensuring access to safe drinking water and converting unsafe sources to safe ones ; The construction of copings around well heads or the installation of boreholes with hand pumps. This would prevent not only dracunculiasis but also diarrhoeal diseases. Regular and systematic filtering of drinking water derived from ponds and shallow unprotected wells or from surface water. Finely-meshed cloth or, better still, a filter made from a 0.15 mm nylon mesh, is all that is needed to filter out the cyclops from the drinking water; Treatment of unsafe water sources with temephos to kill the cyclops; Health education and social mobilization to encourage affected communities to adopt healthy drinking water behaviour."}
{"topic": "/dracunculiasis-(guinea-worm-disease)", "question": "Where is Guinea-worm disease found?", "answer": "The epidemiology of the disease is determined largely by the use of open stagnant water sources such as ponds and sometimes shallow or step wells. Artificial ponds are the main source of transmission. Guinea-worm disease is seasonal, occurring with two broad patterns found in endemic areas of Africa, depending on climatic factors. In the Sahelian zone, transmission generally occurs in the rainy season (May to August). In the humid savanna and forest zone, the peak occurs in the dry season (September to January). However, there are local variations in these patterns. Other risk factors are mobility and infection having occurred the previous year."}
{"topic": "/dracunculiasis-(guinea-worm-disease)", "question": "Is Guinea-worm disease fatal?", "answer": "Guinea-worm disease is rarely fatal. Frequently, however, the patient remains sick for several months, mainly because: The emergence of the worm, sometimes several, is accompanied by painful oedema, intense generalised pruritus, blistering and an ulceration of the area from which the worm emerges. The migration and emergence of the worms occur in sensitive parts of the body, sometimes the articular spaces can lead to permanent disability. Ulcers caused by the emergence of the worm invariably develop secondary bacterial infections which exacerbate inflammation and pain resulting in temporary disability ranging from a few weeks to a few months. Accidental rupture of the worm in the tissue spaces can result in serious allergic reactions. Temporary disability can leave many patients unable to leave their beds for a month during and after the emergence of the worm. This usually occurs during the peak agricultural activities and when labour is in a great demand."}

{"topic": "/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health", "question": "What is the leading cause of death among 15-19 year old girls?", "answer": "Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among 15-19 year old girls globally, followed by self-harm, road injuries, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis. To prevent early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents, WHO recommends the following: reduce marriage before the age of 18 years; reduce pregnancy before the age of 20 years; increase use of contraception by adolescents at risk of unintended pregnancy; reduce coerced sex among adolescents; reduce unsafe abortion among adolescents; and increase use of skilled antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care among adolescents."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis", "question": "What is hepatitis?", "answer": "Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis. There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family member to child, and also by sexual contact. Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms, or may include symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain."}
{"topic": "/hepatitis", "question": "What are the different hepatitis viruses?", "answer": "Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available."}

This will follow an extensive period of consultation with the public and major stakeholders in order to establish the framework for the implementation of the Plan. WHO will engage with other members of cOAlition S during its implementation and will provide updates on how the WHO open-access policy will evolve. [ WHO policy on open access . Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017]"}
{"topic": "/coalition-s", "question": "Why has WHO joined cOAlition S?", "answer": "The principles of Plan S are strongly aligned with the objectives of WHO’s institutional policies (such as the WHO open-access policy) and its strategies (such as the WHO strategy on research for health), as well as its strategic objectives,\r\n        including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and supporting universal health coverage. Ensuring universal access to scientific research publications that are publicly funded is fundamental for enabling better public health. Many institutions\r\n        in the world are unable to access a large proportion of scientific information because they cannot afford the subscriptions that the journal publishers charge. [ WHO strategy on research for health. In: Sixty-third World Health Assembly, Geneva, 17–21 May 2010. Resolutions and decisions, annexes. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2010: Annex 7 (WHA63/2010/REC/1; http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA63-REC1/WHA63_REC1-en.pdf , accessed 28 August 2019).] cOAlition S is supported by several of WHO’s key stakeholders, including Member States, and donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Commission and the Wellcome Trust. By joining cOAlition S, WHO will align itself\r\n        with the open-access principles and objectives of these stakeholders. As the first UN agency or intergovernmental organization to join this initiative, WHO intends to show strong leadership and provide a bold statement to the international public health community."}
{"topic": "/coalition-s", "question": "What are the requirements of Plan S?", "answer": "Researchers must publish in (1) open-access journals or platforms; or (2) in subscription journals (i) that allow authors to deposit the version of record or their accepted manuscript in a public repository immediately, under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY), or (ii) that are covered by a transformative agreement that has a clear and time-specified commitment to transition to full open access."}
{"topic": "/coalition-s", "question": "What is the impact of Plan S on WHO’s open-access policy?", "answer": "WHO’s open-access policy will be updated in 2020 in accordance with the principles and implementation guidance of Plan S. The revised policy will enter into force on 1 January 2021. WHO will also update its grant agreements to reflect the new policy requirements."}
{"topic": "/coalition-s", "question": "If I am a recipient of WHO funding, do I need to follow the requirements of Plan S?", "answer": "If you submit your article to the journal publisher before 1 January 2021, the current WHO open-access policy will apply. Articles submitted on or after this date will be subject to the revised WHO open-access policy, to be developed in 2020."}

{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "Why did WHO establish a Strategic Advisory Group on malaria eradication (SAGme)?", "answer": "In 2016, at the request of the former Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, WHO established a Strategic Advisory Group to tackle\r\n    the big question of malaria eradication, a topic that sparks passions, opinions, excitement and concerns. Dr Chan felt that WHO should have a position on eradication and that it should be based on a thorough and authoritative study rooted in a deep analysis of past and future malaria trends. The group, made up of scientists and public health experts from around the world, came together to advise WHO on what malaria might look like in the future as well as the feasibility of eradication."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "What is WHO’s current position on malaria eradication?", "answer": "Remember that WHO embraced the goal of malaria eradication soon after it was founded in 1948. In 1955, a first Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) was launched. This commitment to eradication was reaffirmed in a World Health Assembly resolution\r\n    of 1969, and later reinforced in 2015 through the Assembly’s endorsement of the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 (GTS). It clearly spells out the vision of a malaria-free world."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "What were the group’s main findings about malaria eradication?", "answer": "The key finding is that a malaria-free world would mean millions of lives saved and a return on investment of billions of dollars. Global megatrends related to climate, urbanisation, agricultural use patterns, electrification mean that malaria will be radically reduced in many areas but remain entrenched in others. Yet even with our most positive projections, if we use our current tools to fight malaria, we will still have 11 million cases of malaria in Africa in 2050. No one can formulate a precise and reliable plan for the eradication of human malaria nor calculate what it will cost. SAGme concluded that, especially with the stalling of process over the past 2 years, we must get the world back on track to meet the GTS targets. To do this, we need a renewed drive towards research and development, including on malaria vaccines and other approaches and tools. We also need political leaders to ensure everyone has access to affordable health care. And we must invest in robust and agile surveillance systems to detect changes in malaria transmission so that we can better target the response. Eradication is still the global vision."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "What is the difference between elimination and eradication?", "answer": "This definition has changed over the years. Currently, we call elimination the interruption of transmission in a given geographical area; usually we refer to a country. Eradication means that all countries have eliminated malaria and there is complete\n    interruption of malaria transmission globally, with zero cases across the globe."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "Does WHO’s advisory group think that malaria can be truly eradicated, as is the case with smallpox?", "answer": "The answer is yes. There is no specific biological or environmental barrier to malaria eradication. However, do we have the tools, programmes and financing that could actually drive an eradication effort now? The answer is no. A successful eradication effort will require tools that we don’t have today. This speaks to the critical importance of an accelerated research and development agenda."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "Why is it taking so long to eradicate malaria?", "answer": "We are fighting a very complex parasite - one that can be transmitted by certain mosquito vectors very efficiently. Malaria roots itself in the heartland of Africa and affects some of the harder-to-reach and more impoverished populations. To date, the disease has received insufficient attention in the research and development space, and insufficient investment to roll out available tools, particularly in countries with weak health systems."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "What is the WHO doing now to fight malaria in areas hardest hit by malaria?", "answer": "WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria are driving the country-led High burden to high impact (HBHI) approach.\r\n It will initially focus on getting the 11 highest burden counties - 10 of which are in Africa - back on track to achieve the GTS targets for 2025. By taking this approach, countries will enable real impact in the fight against malaria. The concrete outcomes we are aiming for include more resources freed up by political leaders, better use of information, stronger technical guidance and a more coordinated\r\n    response to malaria. We will roll out the HBHI approach to all malarious countries in Africa as we progress towards a malaria-free continent."}
{"topic": "/malaria-eradication", "question": "Some experts think that we should have a target date for the malaria eradication goal as we do for some other public health goals. Why can’t we work towards a target date to eradicate malaria?", "answer": "If we consider smallpox, the burden of the disease was relatively low when WHO launched an eradication campaign in 1967. At the time, we had a highly efficacious vaccine and could actually foresee an end date. When the polio eradication campaign was launched in 1988, there were an estimated 330 000 cases of the disease and we had a highly effective vaccine. The campaign originally had a 12 or 15-year timeline. However, 30 years later, despite massive progress,\n    the job has still not been completed. In the case of malaria, we have more than 200 million cases annually, and we don’t have optimal tools. The SAGme believes that setting a date now, when there are so many uncertainties, may actually be counterproductive. Instead, the group is calling\n    for an accelerated effort to achieve the already-approved targets of the GTS, a framework that includes 5-year targets for reductions in malaria cases and deaths through 2030. Following this alternative approach will actually take us along the path towards eradication. We can assess our progress at five-year intervals and eventually determine the tipping point -- when a time-limited, credible, achievable campaign to fully eradicate\n    malaria could be launched. We are clearly not there yet."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "What is the scope of the EUL?", "answer": "WHO has developed the EUL process to expedite the availability of unlicensed medical products needed in public health emergency situations, to assist interested United Nations procurement agencies and WHO Member States in determining the acceptability of using specific products in the context of a public health emergency, based on an essential set of available quality, safety, and efficacy/immunogenicity/ performance data."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Can WHO member states use the EUL as the basis to authorize the use of an unlicensed vaccine/medicine/In Vitro Diagnostics at the national level?", "answer": "Yes. Once a product has been assessed by WHO under the EUL procedure, the outcome will be published and it is the prerogative of each country to use this as the basis for their decision regarding the emergency use authorization of a product at the national level."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "How is the EUL procedure different from Prequalification?", "answer": "The EUL is a special procedure for unlicensed vaccines, medicines and in vitro diagnostics in the event of a public health emergency when the community/public health authorities may be willing to tolerate less certainty about the efficacy and safety of products, given the morbidity and/or mortality of the disease and the lack or paucity of treatment, diagnosis/detection or prevention options. The procedure is intended to provide a time-limited listing for unlicensed products in an emergency context when limited data are available and the products are not yet ready for application for prequalification. As part of the EUL, the expectation is that the manufacturer will complete the development of the product and submit for licensure and WHO prequalification."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Does the listing of a product assessed under the EUL procedure ensure safety, efficacy & performance of the product?", "answer": "The assessment of products under the EUL procedure is conducted on the quality, safety, efficacy or performance data available up to the time of submission. However, since the product is still in development (vaccines and medicines only, IVDs under development are not accepted for assessment), the decision to list will be based on a risk-benefit assessment considering the public health emergency. The available data must provide an indication that the use of the product will provide a benefit to the target population."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "What written standards are used to assess new products if there are no published guidelines for the specific product?", "answer": "The product evaluation committee will prepare a list of existing guidelines that are related to the vaccines and medicines, and published scientific data that may support the evaluation. This list of documents used as reference will be included in the report prepared by the product evaluation committee."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "What are the factors that have an impact on the review timelines?", "answer": "For vaccines, the approval of the product for emergency use by a stringent NRA and the history of the manufacturer with prequalification. For medicines, whether the product has been authorized for emergency use by a stringent regulatory agency/WHO listed authority. For in vitro diagnostics whether the product has been assessed through another emergency mechanism of an acceptable standard."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Is emergency use approval required in the country of manufacture?", "answer": "No. However, when a product has already been assessed and authorized for use in emergency situations by the NRA of the country of manufacture, the assessment may have a shorter timeline as WHO may consider this evaluation to avoid duplication. The selection of assessment pathway, done in the pre-emergency phase, takes this into consideration."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Are manufacturers required to follow-up once a product is listed in the EUL and used in the field?", "answer": "Yes. Since vaccines and medicines assessed using the EUL procedure are still in development, the manufacturers must continue with product development and clinical trials towards registration and prequalification. The manufacturer must notify WHO of any change made to the product. In addition they must provide updated information, so the product evaluation committee reviews and updates their assessment report."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Does WHO need to evaluate a product that has already been approved by a NRA for use in public health emergencies?", "answer": "When the product submitted for EUL has been assessed through other emergency mechanisms by a SRA/WLA (for vaccines or medicines) WHO does not intend to duplicate work. However, WHO may still perform some assessment activities –if deemed necessary to provide a level of assurance of quality, safety, efficacy and performance of the products according to the settings in which the product will be used. In the case of vaccines, programmatic aspects are critical and are never assessed by the NRA of the manufacturing country as they refer to matters outside of the NRA’s jurisdiction. In general, in this case, the assessment pathway will consider the assessment by the NRA and may shorten the timeline significantly. For IVDs, WHO will perform an assessment independent of a prior NRA assessment."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Will WHO review only information on preclinical and clinical data to make a risk/benefit assessment?", "answer": "No. WHO will also review quality aspects (and performance in case of in vitro diagnostics). In addition to the data indicating safety and efficacy of the product, compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices is also a requirement."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "How will monitoring and surveillance be performed post-listing?", "answer": "After a product has been listed, WHO will take into consideration reports on safety surveillance, efficacy/effectiveness/performance monitoring, quality complaints and other relevant data that may impact the validity of the listing status. The sources of such information will inter alia be based on existing surveillance mechanisms in affected countries (as discussed with relevant NRAs during the pre-emergency phase for vaccines and medicines) and on post-listing surveillance commitments of the manufacturer, set as conditions for the listing."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Is WHO able to de-list a product that has been granted an EUL?", "answer": "Yes. Updated information from the manufacturer or from the field may alter the initial assessment of the risk/benefit profile used to support the initial decision."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "Can a medical product be assessed under the EUL procedures for a new indication or subpopulation?", "answer": "Yes. An existing product that is found to be safe and efficacious for treatment of prevention of a disease in an emergency may be assessed. However, clinical data relevant to the use of such products in the new indication or subpopulation must be generated and submitted."}
{"topic": "/q-a-for-guidelines-on-emergency-use-listing-procedure", "question": "For how long can a product assessed under the EUL remain listed?", "answer": "The validity of an emergency use listing in the context of a public health emergency will generally be for 12 months. All decisions to list a product in the EUL will be reassessed at 12 months intervals (or sooner, if further data become available that could alter the original decision). When deemed necessary, the emergency use listing can be extended. Products may be taken off the EUL list earlier, if new data become available that change the benefit-risk balance of the product or immediately upon termination of the public health emergency."}
{"topic": "/nutrition-the-decade-of-action", "question": "What is the Decade of Action (DoA)?", "answer": "The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, under the normative \r\nframework of ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, marks\r\n a new ambition and direction in global nutrition action: to eradicate \r\nhunger, end malnutrition in all its forms (undernutrition, micronutrient\r\n deficiencies, overweight or obesity) and reduce the burden of \r\ndiet-related noncommunicable diseases in all age groups. The Decade will provide an umbrella for all relevant \r\nstakeholders voluntarily to consolidate and align nutrition actions \r\nacross different sectors and facilitate policy processes across the \r\nareas identified in the ICN2 outcome documents. The Decade is an unprecedented opportunity for achieving \r\nnutrition impact at scale, with a collective vision of a healthier and \r\nmore sustainable future. The vision of the Decade is of a world where all nutrition \r\nchampions coordinate action and strengthen collaboration so that all \r\npeople at all times and at all stages of life have access to affordable,\r\n diversified, safe and healthy diets. The Decade will work for a 10-year period within existing structures and available resources. The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition is not an initiative; it is not a programme nor a project."}
{"topic": "/nutrition-the-decade-of-action", "question": "Why do we need a UN Decade of Action on Nutrition?", "answer": "Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is among the most \r\nurgent and pervasive development challenges. Most countries are burdened\r\n by more than one form of malnutrition or diet-related noncommunicable \r\ndiseases. These forms may co-exist within the same country, community, \r\nhousehold or individual. Many families cannot afford enough nutrient rich foods, like \r\nfresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat and milk, while foods and \r\ndrinks high in fat, sugar or salt are often cheap and readily available. The world is producing more than enough food to feed everyone.\r\n Yet one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted \r\nglobally throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural \r\nproduction to final individual food consumption. Prioritized and accelerated action-oriented efforts within the\r\n Decade will lead the world to meeting the World Health Assembly six \r\nglobal nutrition targets 2025 and the global diet-related \r\nnoncommunicable diseases targets, and the many additional \r\nnutrition-relevant targets in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment."}
{"topic": "/nutrition-the-decade-of-action", "question": "Who is involved in the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition?", "answer": "The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition belongs to everyone and \r\naims to involve all countries, regardless of their income, the nature of\r\n their malnutrition challenges and the characteristics of their food and\r\n health systems. The Decade is a global collective effort driven by UN Members \r\nStates and co-convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), in \r\ncollaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), the International \r\nFund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF). FAO and WHO, as co-convenors, will: promote policy dialogue at all levels; develop tools and instruments to support the implementation of programmes, policies, partnerships and investment; and track and report on progress toward achieving global goals and country-specific commitments for action on nutrition. National governments and other relevant stakeholders, \r\nincluding international, intergovernmental and regional organizations, \r\nparliamentarians, civil society, academia and private sector all have an\r\n active role to play in the implementation of the Decade. In particular, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) \r\nprovides a vital multistakeholder platform where countries and their \r\nmany partners can discuss progress, exchange lessons and experiences and\r\n agree on coherent and consistent food security and nutrition policies. \r\nThe UN System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) serves as a \r\ncoordinating mechanism for the UN bodies and international organizations\r\n involved."}
{"topic": "/nutrition-the-decade-of-action", "question": "Are there specific events on the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition and/ or key opportunities to share and discuss progress towards ending all forms of malnutrition?", "answer": "FAO and WHO will work with the widest possible range of social\r\n actors and institutions, taking the opportunity to build upon and \r\nconnect already planned events and to organize new bridge-building \r\nevents to\r\npromote the Decade and its aims. On 20 September 2016 the co-convenors \r\nlaunched a major consultation process to develop the work programme of \r\nthe Decade. A series of consultations through coordination mechanisms such\r\n as UNSCN and multistakeholder platforms such as CFS, on-line forums and\r\n face-to-face meetings are being prepared to engage as many stakeholders\r\n as possible in the strategic process of developing the work programme. \r\nParticipants will be invited to share views and ideas as well as receive\r\n feedback from countries and stakeholders on their expectations for the \r\nupcoming ten years. Many countries and other actors are already strongly committed\r\n to existing food and nutrition initiatives, mechanisms, alliances, \r\nmovements or partnerships. These efforts will provide the structure for \r\naction. The umbrella of the Decade creates a framework for sharing \r\nexperiences, promoting improved coordination by the participants \r\nthemselves, and building political momentum for scaled up global action. The Decade will facilitate North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation and learning."}
{"topic": "/nutrition-the-decade-of-action", "question": "How is the work programme for the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition being prepared and implemented?", "answer": "The work programme of the Decade will be a global programme but with action at the country level. Setting out the work programme of the Decade will be an \r\ninclusive, continuous, and collaborative process, building upon and \r\nconnecting the independent initiatives of governments and their many \r\npartners. Advocating for commitments by all stakeholders to implement \r\nspecific interventions, policies, programmes and investments for action \r\non nutrition in all relevant sectors will be crucial in order to bring \r\nabout a real and meaningful system change to end all forms of \r\nmalnutrition. The Decade will provide a standardized global framework \r\nfor making, reporting and monitoring progress and for tracking results. All stakeholders are invited to submit inputs to the work \r\nprogramme of the Decade, taking as reference the six pillars identified \r\nin the ICN2 Framework for Action. These six pillars are: sustainable food systems for healthy diets; aligned health systems providing universal coverage of essential nutrition actions; social protection and nutrition education; trade and investment for improved nutrition; enabling food and breastfeeding environments; and review, strengthen and promote nutrition governance and accountability. Stakeholders are encouraged to set, track and achieve \r\nspecific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) \r\ncommitments. This will help all stakeholders understand what action is \r\nintended and\r\nimprove tracking. Three groups of catalytic mechanisms will support the progress\r\n on nutrition commitments across the Decade: evidence informed advocacy,\r\n convening platforms and accountability mechanisms."}
{"topic": "/nutrition-the-decade-of-action", "question": "How is the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition contributing to the achievement of Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals?", "answer": "With the adoption of the Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) at the UN General Assembly in September 2015, \r\nworld leaders committed to rid the world of the twin scourges of poverty\r\n and hunger and set out a vision for a fairer, more inclusive, \r\nprosperous, peaceful and sustainable world in which no one is left \r\nbehind. SDG 2 in particular, aims to end hunger, achieve food security \r\nand improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The achievement of the 2030 SDGs will only be met when much \r\ngreater political focus is given towards improving nutrition, as \r\nnutrition is both an input and outcome of sustainable development. The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition provides an opportunity \r\nfor all partners to work together, mobilize action and accelerate efforts\r\n towards the elimination of hunger, food insecurity and all forms of \r\nmalnutrition and meeting the SDGs by 2030."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "What is meant by a fair price?", "answer": "For the purposes of this initiative a ‘fair’ price is one that is affordable for health systems and patients and that at the same time provides sufficient market incentive for industry to invest in innovation and the production of medicines. In other words, fairness here implies positive incentives and/or benefits for all stakeholders – i.e. those who purchase and use medicines, and those involved in the R&D and manufacture of medicines."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "Does the concept of ‘fair pricing’ replace the principle of affordability?", "answer": "Absolutely not. The Fair Pricing Forum strives to increase access through better affordability. It focuses on new, high-priced medicines and vaccines that are currently unaffordable in most countries – regardless of income. But it also looks at old medicines whose prices have been so reduced that they no longer present any kind of incentive for manufacturers. The principle of affordability and access to quality medicines guides the fair pricing initiative and remains a stalwart of WHO’s work on access to medical products."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "Pricing Forum taking place?", "answer": "The Forum is taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 11-13 April 2019 and is co-sponsored by the South African National Department of Health and WHO."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "Is it a WHO or a South African initiative?", "answer": "Fair pricing is a WHO initiative supported by many governments, including the Government of South Africa through its Minister of Health, who will be hosting the forum along with the WHO Director-General."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "What does it aim to achieve?", "answer": "The ‘Fair Pricing Forum’ aims to provide a global platform to discuss ways to improve access to medicines – including high-priced ones – within the overall effort of supporting countries to develop effective access strategies to achieve universal health coverage. At the same time, it also intends to understand the input needed by the pharmaceutical industry to improve R&D and innovation from a public health perspective and to keep old and generic essential medicines on the market."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "Who will be invited to participate in the forum?", "answer": "Participants include WHO Member State Governments, patient associations, civil society, insurers and the pharmaceutical industry."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "What is at the origin of the fair pricing forum – why now?", "answer": "The intention behind the fair pricing initiative is closely linked to WHO’s broader agenda for supporting access to medicines, improving public health across all regions and promoting universal health coverage. In addition, WHO Member States have formally requested that WHO’s Director General, through World Health Assembly Resolution WHA67.22 (Access to essential medicines, 2014), support countries to “ensure access to safe, effective and quality-assured essential medicines, including high price essential medicines.” The current status of medicines prices is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges to health systems everywhere and is the subject of countless debates in parliaments and in both medical and mainstream media. The time is ripe for greater involvement of the global health community to discuss this issue and seek realistic solutions for greater affordability. The main barrier to accessing many new and effective medicines, especially for cancer and orphan drugs, and more recently for hepatitis C, is their lack of affordability, even when there is evidence to show that manufacturing them is relatively inexpensive. This problem is now touching not only low-income countries, it is affecting middle- and high-income countries as well. At the other end of the spectrum is the problem of drug shortages or poor quality for some old and off-patent medicines. There are a number of examples, ranging from benzathine penicillin to methotrexate, where there are significant problems with lack of manufacturers. For these products, it is necessary to work out what a ‘fair’ price would be that ensures quality products and ongoing supply."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "What is WHO’s role in this field?", "answer": "WHO has both the mandate and the responsibility to address barriers to accessing health products and services that are vital to improving public health. As the global health coordinator within the UN system, WHO provides a unique global platform to discuss policy options for increased access to medicines through its convening power with all public health actors, both national and international."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "What evidence/data will WHO use to argue for fairness in pricing?", "answer": "In the lead-up to the forum, WHO will publish reports and landscape analyses related to pricing and the cost of R&D and production of medicines and other health technologies. It is hoped that a comprehensive report on pricing will be ready for launch at the May forum."}
{"topic": "/medicines-fair-pricing-forum", "question": "How does this fair pricing initiative fit in with the GSPOA, CEWG and the UNHLP on access to medicines?", "answer": "Fair pricing focuses on specific issues related to pricing (high and low prices) that constitute access barriers in an attempt to find strategies for countries to address these barriers in the near future. We believe that this initiative will contribute to the goals of the Global Strategy and Plan of action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (GSPOA), the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development (CEWG) and the UN High Level Panel on Access to Medicines. The initiative does not replace WHO’s ongoing work on intellectual property and TRIPS flexibilities."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-eoc-exercise", "question": "What is the GEOCX Exercise?", "answer": "WHO has developed a framework to provide Member States with high-level guidance for\r\nestablishing or strengthening a functional Public Health Emergency Operations Centre\r\n(PHEOC). With Member States and international health emergency support agencies, WHO has\r\nundertaken a series of simulation exercises to assess the functionality and interoperability of the\r\nPHEOCs of selected Member States."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-eoc-exercise", "question": "What is a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC)?", "answer": "A PHEOC is a type of emergency operations centre that is addresses the specific requirements\r\nfor coordinating responses to public health emergencies such as communicable disease\r\noutbreaks. Such a centre is a physical location or virtual space in which designated emergency\r\nmanagement functions are performed. It is supported by appropriate legal authority and\r\nregulations, and designed and resourced with sustainability in mind. All emergency operations\r\ncentres perform a vital role in the coordination of information and resources for efficient and\r\neffective responses to emergency events. An operations centre may be a temporary facility or\r\nmay be established in a permanent location."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-eoc-exercise", "question": "What is an exercise?", "answer": "Exercises comprise a variety of forms of training and evaluation. In this functional exercise a\r\nglobal public health event is simulated through the introduction of events in a scenario. People\r\nin the EOC will respond to the simulated events in their normal roles in the centre, drawing on\r\nestablished plans and procedures. This allows them to practice and maintain critical skill sets,\r\nand to continuously improve the overall functioning of the EOC, based on post exercise\r\nevaluations."}
{"topic": "/q-a-global-eoc-exercise", "question": "How does the exercise work?", "answer": "GEOCX is a simulated interactive exercise that is focused on the management of acute public\r\nhealth events. This will be a ‘functional’ exercise which will provide an opportunity for all players\r\nand entities to demonstrate and enhance their understanding of the event management\r\nprocesses by practicing their various roles and responsibilities during an international health\r\nsecurity event. GEOCX, along with other activities, is part of the commitment of WHO and partners to assist\r\nMember States to develop and maintain effectiveness in the management of public health\r\nevents that may have national, regional and international implications. This exercise supports\r\nMember States in pandemic preparedness and response activities."}

{"topic": "/q-a-who-expert-committee-on-drug-dependence-review-of-cannabis-august-2018", "question": "The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) just held a special session on cannabis. Why is this important?", "answer": "It was the first time the WHO ECDD reviewed cannabis and cannabis-related\r\nsubstances to consider the appropriateness of their current scheduling within the\r\nInternational Drug Control Conventions. The Committee, which met from 4-7 June 2018, conducted a pre-review of cannabis related substances that are currently subject to international control: Cannabis plant (e.g. marijuana) and cannabis resin (e.g. hashish) Extracts and tinctures of cannabis (oils, edibles, liquids) Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) e.g. dronabinol Isomers of THC The ECCD also conducted a critical review of preparations considered to be pure\r\ncannabidiol (CBD), a major component of the plant."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-expert-committee-on-drug-dependence-review-of-cannabis-august-2018", "question": "What is the difference between a pre-review and a critical review?", "answer": "A pre-review is the first step of the ECDD’s assessment process, where it is determined\r\nwhether there is enough robust scientific information to proceed to the next step, called\r\na critical review. This initial evaluation is also an opportunity to identify gaps in the\r\navailable scientific data. A critical review is carried out when there is sufficient scientific evidence to allow the\r\nECDD to make informed an recommendation that the substance be placed under\r\ninternational control, or if its level of control should be changed. Substances under control are regulated by the International Drug Control Conventions,\r\nwhich restrict international production and trade of these substances.

{"topic": "/q-a-who-expert-committee-on-drug-dependence-review-of-cannabis-august-2018", "question": "What did the ECDD decide?", "answer": "The Committee made two main decisions: There was sufficient evidence to proceed to a critical review of cannabis and\r\nrelated substances at the next ECDD meeting in November 2018. The ECDD recommended that preparations considered to be pure cannabidiol\r\n(CBD) not be placed under international drug control as the substance was not\r\nfound to have psychoactive properties, and presents no potential for abuse or\r\ndependence."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-expert-committee-on-drug-dependence-review-of-cannabis-august-2018", "question": "Does this mean that cannabis-related substances should be available for medical use?", "answer": "The ECDD is an independent group of experts in the field of drug dependence\r\nconvened by WHO. Its role is not to recommend the use of substances for medical\r\ntreatment, but rather to advise on the scheduling of substances based on evaluations of\r\npotential for harm, dependence and abuse from a public health perspective, as well as\r\ntheir therapeutic usefulness. WHO then makes recommendations to the UN Secretary General, and the decision\r\nwhether to adopt the recommendations is subject to a vote by the UN Commission on\r\nNarcotic Drugs."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-expert-committee-on-drug-dependence-review-of-cannabis-august-2018", "question": "What information did the ECDD consider when making their decisions?", "answer": "WHO commissioned reviews of each cannabis-related substance from scientific experts\r\nin five different disciplines: chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, epidemiology, and\r\ntherapeutic use. The experts were selected through a rigorous screening process in\r\naccordance with WHO procurement guidelines and on the basis of demonstrated\r\nextensive knowledge of and expertise in the subject. Selection criteria were also\r\ndesigned to ensure balanced geographic and gender representation. In accordance with\r\nWHO policy, all experts were asked to disclose potential conflicts of interest. All Member States were invited to submit relevant information to the ECDD through a\r\nspecially designed questionnaire to gather insights into the legitimate use, harmful use,\r\nstatus of national control, and potential impact of international control for each\r\nsubstance under evaluation. The ECDD meeting also included an Open Session at which representatives of civil\r\nsociety, patient groups, academics and commercial parties had the opportunity to share\r\ntheir views and experiences regarding the uses of cannabis for the Committee’s\r\nconsideration."}
{"topic": "/q-a-who-expert-committee-on-drug-dependence-review-of-cannabis-august-2018", "question": "Why had cannabis never been reviewed until now?", "answer": "The ECDD acts in accordance with International Drug Control Conventions that identify\r\ncriteria to schedule or propose rescheduling of substances under control. Within these\r\nConventions, there has until recently been limited robust scientific information about the health effects of cannabis for the ECDD to consider its review. As more Member States\r\npermit the use of cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes, more evidence is\r\nemerging about their health effects.

{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-risk-communication-guidance", "question": "Why is emergency risk communication guidance needed?", "answer": "During public health emergencies, people need to know what health risks they face, and what actions they can take to protect their lives, their health, their families and communities. Accurate information, provided early, often, and in language and channels people understand, trust and use, enables people to make choices that can protect them from health hazards threatening their lives and well-being."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-risk-communication-guidance", "question": "What is new about this guidance?", "answer": "WHO has manuals, training modules and other forms of emergency communication and risk communication guidance based on expert opinion or lessons drawn from major environmental disasters, such as the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, rather than systematic analysis of the evidence. This is the first ever evidence-based risk communications guidance. The recommendations in this guidance are based on a systematic search of the evidence on key issues in emergency risk communication practice and experience. Not only was the academic structured evidence searched but also ‘grey literature’ to ensure that the lessons learned from recent emergencies, such as the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014–2015 and the global Zika virus outbreak in 2015–2016, were captured and explored fully. Evidence for decision making"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-risk-communication-guidance", "question": "Who should use this guidance?", "answer": "These guidelines were developed for policy- and decision-makers responsible for managing emergencies, particularly the public health aspects of emergencies, and practitioners responsible for risk communication before, during and after health emergencies. Other groups expected to use these guidelines are front-line responders, local, national and international development partners, civil society, the private sector and all organizations, private and public, involved in emergency preparedness and response."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-risk-communication-guidance", "question": "What are they key recommendations in this guidance?", "answer": "These guidelines provide WHO Member States, partners and stakeholders involved in emergency preparedness and response with evidence-based, up-to-date, systems-focused guidance on: building trust and engaging with communities and affected populations; integrating risk communication into existing national and local emergency preparedness and response structures, including building capacity for risk communication; emergency risk communication practice - from planning, messaging, channels and methods of communication and engagement to monitoring and evaluation - based on a systematic assessment of the evidence on what worked and what did not work during recent emergencies."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-risk-communication-guidance", "question": "How should these guidelines be used?", "answer": "The recommendations in these guidelines provide overarching, evidence-based guidance on how risk communication should be practiced in an emergency. The recommendations also guide countries to build capacity for communicating risk during health emergencies. Specific ‘how-to-do-it’ step-by-step instructions are beyond the remit of these guidelines. However, in due course, these will be provided in detailed manuals, standard operating procedures, pocket guides, checklists, training modules and other tools developed to elaborate the recommendations."}
{"topic": "/cannabidiol-(compound-of-cannabis)", "question": "What is Cannabidiol and is it safe?", "answer": "Cannabidiol is one of several (probably 200) compounds of the cannabis plant. At its November 2017 meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug\r\n Dependence (ECDD) concluded that, in its pure state, cannabidiol does \r\nnot appear to have abuse potential or cause harm.  As such, as CBD is \r\nnot currently a scheduled substance in its own right (only as a \r\ncomponent of cannabis extracts), current information does not justify a \r\nchange in this scheduling position and does not justify scheduling of \r\nthe substance. However, where CBD is produced for pharmaceutical purposes as \r\nan extract of cannabis, cannabis extracts and tinctures are included in \r\nthe 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. A fuller review of \r\nextracts or preparations containing almost exclusively CBD will take \r\nplace in June 2018, when the WHO expert committee will undertake a \r\ncomprehensive review of cannabis and cannabis related substances. Not scheduling a substance means that it is not subject to \r\nstrict international controls, including for production and supply.  Its\r\n legal status in countries is something for national legislators to \r\ndecide. Some countries have eased regulations around cannabidiol, to \r\nconsider products containing CBD to be medical products.  These include \r\nAustralia, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United \r\nStates of America."}
{"topic": "/cannabidiol-(compound-of-cannabis)", "question": "What evidence is there that Cannabidiol has value for medical use?", "answer": "WHO does not recommend cannabidiol for medical use. Initial \r\nevidence from animal and human studies (i.e. a controlled study in the \r\nNew England Journal of Medicine and other reported individual cases) \r\nshows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to\r\n epilepsy and related conditions. Some people have been using cannabidiol to calm spasms during \r\nepileptic fits.  The New England Journal of Medicine also published a \r\nstudy lately saying there is some evidence it may be effective during \r\nepileptic seizures.  This means it could have some medical use but more \r\nevidence is needed."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "How does the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals lead to antimicrobial resistance in humans?\r\n﻿", "answer": "The high volume of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, particularly in settings of intensive animal production. In some countries, the total amount of antibiotics used in animals is 4 times larger than the amount used in humans. In many countries much of the antibiotics used in animals are for growth promotion and prevention of disease, not to treat sick animals. These bacteria can be transmitted from animals to humans via direct contact between animals and humans, or through the food chain and the environment. Antimicrobial-resistant infections in humans can cause longer illnesses, increased frequency of hospitalization, and treatment failures that can result in death. Some types of bacteria that cause serious infections in humans have already developed resistance to most or all of the available treatments and we are running out of treatment options for some types of infection. WHO recommends an overall reduction in use of antibiotics in food-producing animals to help preserve their effectiveness for human medicine."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "Why is antimicrobial resistance important for food safety?", "answer": "Many of the bacteria (such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli) carried by animals can also cause disease in people. These bacteria, which are frequently antimicrobial-resistant, can contaminate our food supply from farm to fork, such as through slaughtering and processing. Fruits and vegetables may also be contaminated by such bacteria at the farm or later through cross-contamination. We know about this because we can link drug-resistant bacteria isolated from sick people to an agricultural source through DNA fingerprinting. Over 400 000 people die each year from foodborne diseases, with over one-third of these deaths occurring in children under 5 years of age. The vast majority of foodborne illnesses are caused by microbes, including bacteria, according to WHO estimates . If these bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, it will become impossible to treat them and more people will die from foodborne diseases."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "Why is WHO providing advice to the agriculture sector?", "answer": "WHO is providing advice to the agriculture sector because the most effective way to prevent the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from food-producing animals to humans is by preventing the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals. WHO’s mandate is to build a better, healthier future for people all over the world. This includes protecting people from health threats due to antimicrobial-resistant infections and unsafe food. Antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to human health. Optimizing the use of antibiotics in both human medicine and animal husbandry will help slow down its emergence and spread. These WHO guidelines were developed to reduce this important public health threat to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics important for human health. The recommendations are based on WHO’s list of critically important antimicrobials for human medicine, with the goal to safeguard all, especially critically important antibiotics. to treat multi-drug resistant infections in humans."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "Who are the important actors that can help implement the recommendations in the Guidelines?", "answer": "These guidelines are relevant to every country, regardless of region, income and setting. The primary audience of these guidelines is policy makers and regulatory officials overseeing the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. In addition, veterinarians, food animal organizations, food producers, pharmaceutical companies, animal health and public health officials, physicians and other health providers all have a role to play. Consumers also have a strong influence on the way foods are produced and are driving the market for meat produced without routine use of antibiotics in some countries. For example, Namibia has developed a strong export market for its beef since it introduced a ban on the use of antibiotics for growth promotion."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "Do the Guidelines call for a total ban of the preventive use of antibiotics in animals?", "answer": "Recommendation No.3 of the new guidelines says that antibiotics should not be used as a preventive tool in the absence of disease in animals. The use of antimicrobials for disease prevention may be justified when a veterinary professional judges that there is a high risk of spread of a particular infectious disease, if such a judgement is made on the basis of recent culture and sensitivity testing results. The antimicrobials used should start with those of least importance for human health, i.e. start with classes not used in humans, and then as listed on the WHO List of critically important antimicrobials for human medicine (important and then highly important). Antimicrobials classified by WHO as critically important for human medicine should be used in animals only when the most recent culture and sensitivity results of bacteria known to have caused the disease indicate that the critically important antimicrobial is the only option. The WHO guidelines address the use of antibiotics used in human medicine. Antibiotics that are used only in animals are outside the scope of the guidelines. All possible means, such as improved hygiene and vaccination, should be taken to reduce the risks of food producing animals contracting infections and therefore reduce the need for antibiotics."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "How were FAO and OIE involved in the development of the guidelines?", "answer": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and WHO have a long history of collaboration to address health threats at the human-animal-ecosystems interface. A number of expert meetings have been held jointly or in partnership with these agencies since 1997 to address antimicrobial resistance in the food chain, providing a basis for the development of the WHO guidelines. WHO appreciates the important roles played by FAO and OIE in the development of these guidelines. Recent reviews and data on antibiotic resistance in agriculture provided by FAO and OIE were used by the Guideline Development Group, which was responsible for assessing the evidence and for formulating the recommendations, and are quoted throughout the guidelines. Representatives from FAO and OIE were appointed as special members of the WHO Steering Group and were invited to attend the meetings of the Guideline Development Group as observers and they provided input to the draft guidelines. FAO and OIE were also invited to nominate members of the External Review Group, which provided comments on the draft final guidelines."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance-in-the-food-chain", "question": "Why are some of the recommendation made with \"low-quality evidence\"?", "answer": "WHO’s guideline development process uses the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for assessment of the quality of the scientific evidence upon which the recommendations are based. The GRADE approach is designed to assess the effectiveness of specific interventions, such as a new treatment for a disease. It rates evidence derived from randomized controlled trials as “high quality”, while evidence from epidemiological studies, surveillance programmes and other sources of observational data, in which unknown confounders cannot be adequately controlled for, is rated initially as “low quality”, which can be upgraded according to specific criteria. In common with many important public health issues, due to ethical and technical complexity, there are very few randomized controlled studies that have assessed associations between use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and risks of human exposure to and infection by drug-resistant zoonotic pathogens. Most of the supporting scientific evidence – the best available - was collected from epidemiological studies, surveillance programmes and observational studies. In addition to the quality of the evidence and the balance of benefits and harms of an intervention, a number of other factors are considered when Guideline Development Groups formulate recommendations. These factors include the relative value placed on the potential beneficial and harmful outcomes of an intervention, the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, resource considerations, and effects on equity across subpopulations. A “strong recommendation” means that after taking all relevant considerations into account, the Guideline Development Group is reasonably certain that the desirable consequences (benefits) of an intervention outweigh the undesirable consequences (risks or harms), such that the intervention should be implemented in most contexts."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "What is plague?", "answer": "Plague is an infectious disease found in some small mammals and \r\ntheir fleas. People can contract plague if they are in bitten by \r\ninfected fleas, and develop the bubonic form of plague. Sometimes \r\nbubonic plague progresses to pneumonic plague, when the bacteria reaches\r\n the lungs. Person-to-person transmission is possible through the \r\ninhalation of infected respiratory droplets of a person who has \r\npneumonic plague. Common antibiotics are efficient to cure plague, if \r\nthey are delivered very early, because the course of the disease is \r\nusually rapid. Fact sheet on plague"}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "What are the types of plague and how do people become infected?", "answer": "There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the\r\n route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. All forms are treatable and \r\ncurable if detected early enough. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally\r\n and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. \r\npestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to \r\nthe nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then \r\nbecomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a \"bubo\". At advanced\r\n stages of infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores \r\nfilled with puss. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare.\r\n Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more \r\nsevere type of plague called Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague – or lung-based plague – is the most \r\nvirulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any \r\nperson with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to \r\nother humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated \r\nearly, is fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and \r\ntreated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms)."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "What are the symptoms of plague?", "answer": "Symptoms typically include sudden onset fever, chills, head and \r\nbody aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Painful and inflamed lymph\r\n nodes can also appear during bubonic plague. Symptoms of the pneumonic \r\nform appear quickly after infection (sometimes less than 24 hours), and \r\ninclude severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and \r\ncoughing, often with blood-tainted sputum."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "How does pneumonic differ from bubonic plague?", "answer": "Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague, but cannot be \r\neasily transmitted between people. Some people with bubonic plague will \r\ndevelop pneumonic plague, meaning the infection spreads to their lungs. \r\nPneumonic plague can be transmitted between people through coughing. \r\nBubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30% to 60%, while the pneumonic \r\nform is fatal in the absence of treatment. Both types have good recovery\r\n rates if people are treated in time."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "How can I protect myself from being infected with plague?", "answer": "To prevent the spread of pneumonic plague, avoid close contact \r\n(under 2 meters) with someone who is coughing, and reduce time spent in \r\ncrowded areas. To prevent bubonic plague, do not touch dead animals and \r\nwear insect repellent while in plague endemic areas."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "What should I do if I suspect I have plague?", "answer": "In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed \r\nlymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted \r\nexpectoration, people should immediately contact a medical provider for \r\nan evaluation. (Travellers who have left plague-affected areas should \r\ninform their health worker of their travel history to a plague-affected \r\narea.) People should avoid self-medication, including using antibiotics,\r\n unless they are diagnosed by a health worker."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "How do you diagnose plague?", "answer": "Health workers make an evaluation based on symptoms. Confirmation \r\nis based on laboratory testing  from a sample of blood, sputum (fluid \r\ncoughed up from inside the lungs) or pus from a bubo."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "How can plague be treated?", "answer": "Plague can be treated with antibiotics, and recovery is common if \r\ntreatment starts early. In areas where there is a plague outbreak, \r\npeople with symptoms should go to a health centre for evaluation and \r\ntreatment.  Patients with pneumonic plague must be isolated and treated \r\nby trained medical staff wearing personal protective equipment."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "If I am in an area with an active plague outbreak, should I wear a mask to protect myself?", "answer": "It depends on your level of exposure to sick people. People living\r\n in communities where there is a plague can wear masks if they wish, but\r\n masks must be used and disposed of properly so they do not become a \r\nsource of infection themselves. Masks may help to reduce the spread of \r\npneumonic plague if they are used correctly by people who are sick (to \r\nreduce the spread of droplets), and by health care workers (to protect \r\nthemselves)."}
{"topic": "/plague", "question": "Do dead bodies spread plague?", "answer": "The body of someone who has died after being infected with plague \r\ncan infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are \r\npreparing the body for burial. The source of infection is the bacteria \r\nthat are still present in body fluids."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)-radiation-and-skin-cancer", "question": "What are the different types of skin cancer?", "answer": "Non-melanoma skin cancers Non-melanoma skin cancers comprise basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. These are rarely lethal but surgical treatment is painful and often disfiguring. The temporal trends of the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers are difficult to determine, because reliable registration of these cancers has not been achieved. However, specific studies carried out in Australia, Canada and the United States, indicate that between the 1960s and the 1980s the prevalence of non-melanoma skin cancers increased by a factor of more than two. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancers has been examined with respect to personal exposure, and the following conclusions can be drawn: Non-melanoma skin cancers are most frequent on parts of the body that are commonly exposed to the sun such as ears, face, neck and forearms. This implies that long-term, repeated UV radiation exposure is a major causal factor. Within some countries there is a clear relationship between increasing incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers with decreasing latitude, i.e. higher UV radiation levels. Malignant melanoma Malignant melanoma, although far less prevalent than non-melanoma skin cancers, is the major cause of death from skin cancer and is more likely to be reported and accurately diagnosed than non-melanoma skin cancers. Since the early 1970s, malignant melanoma incidence has increased significantly, for example an average 4 per cent every year in the United States. A large number of studies indicate that the risk of malignant melanoma correlates with genetic and personal characteristics, and a person’s UV exposure behaviour. The following is a summary of the main human risk factors: A large number of atypical nevi (moles) is the strongest risk factor for malignant melanoma in fair-skinned populations. Malignant melanoma is more common among people with a pale complexion, blue eyes, and red or fair hair. Experimental studies have demonstrated a lower minimum erythema dose and more prolonged erythema in melanoma patients than in controls. High, intermittent exposure to solar UV appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma. The incidence of malignant melanoma in white populations generally increases with decreasing latitude, with the highest recorded incidence occurring in Australia, where the annual rates are 10 and over 20 times the rates in Europe for women and men respectively. Several epidemiological studies support a positive association with history of sunburn, particularly sunburn at an early age. The role of cumulative sun exposure in the development of malignant melanoma is equivocal. However, malignant melanoma risk is higher in people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancers and of solar keratoses, both of which are indicators of cumulative UV exposure."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)-radiation-and-skin-cancer", "question": "How common is skin cancer?", "answer": "The incidence of both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers has been increasing over the past decades. Currently, between 2 and 3 million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers occur globally each year. One in every three cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer and, according to Skin Cancer Foundation Statistics, one in every five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. As ozone levels are depleted, the atmosphere loses more and more of its protective filter function and more solar UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface. It is estimated that a 10 per cent decrease in ozone levels will result in an additional 300,000 non-melanoma and 4,500 melanoma skin cancer cases. The global incidence of melanoma continues to increase – however, the main factors that predispose to the development of melanoma seem to be connected with recreational exposure to the sun and a history of sunburn. These factors lie within each individual's own responsibility."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)-radiation-and-skin-cancer", "question": "Who is most at risk of getting skin cancer?", "answer": "Due to their relative lack of skin pigmentation Caucasian populations generally have a much higher risk of getting non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers than dark-skinned populations. Naturally brown and black people (skin types V, VI – see table)\r\n    can usually safely tolerate relatively high levels of sun exposure without getting sunburnt or greatly increasing their skin cancer risk. In contrast, people with pale or freckled skin, fair or red hair and blue eyes belong to the highest risk group\r\n    (skin types I, II); people with dark hair and eyes who do not normally get sunburnt are at medium risk of developing skin cancer (skin types III, IV).

{"topic": "/one-health", "question": "What is 'One Health'?", "answer": "'One Health' is an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and the environment. It is particularly important to prevent, predict, detect, and respond to global health threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach mobilizes multiple sectors, disciplines and communities at varying levels of society to work together. This way, new and better ideas are developed that address root causes and create long-term, sustainable solutions. One Health involves the public health, veterinary, public health and environmental sectors. The One Health approach is particularly relevant for food and water safety, nutrition, the control of zoonoses (diseases that can spread between animals and humans,\r\n    such as flu, rabies and Rift Valley fever), pollution management, and combatting antimicrobial resistance (the emergence of microbes that are resistant to antibiotic therapy). To view more related questions and answers, click here ."}
{"topic": "/one-health", "question": "Who makes the One Health approach work?", "answer": "Government officials, researchers and workers across sectors at the local, national, regional and global levels should implement joint responses to health threats. This includes developing shared databases and surveillance across different sectors, and identifying new solutions that address the root causes and links between risks and impacts. Community engagement is also critical to promote risk-reducing habits and attitudes, and to support early detection and containment of disease threats."}
{"topic": "/one-health", "question": "How is WHO advancing One Health approaches?", "answer": "WHO formed a One Health Initiative to integrate work on human, animal and environmental health across the Organization. WHO is also working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as a One Health Quadripartite. The Quadripartite is promoting multi-sectoral approaches to reduce health threats at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. The transformations required to prevent and mitigate the impact of current and future health challenges at global, regional and country levels is outlined in the Quadripartite One Health Joint Plan of Action (OH-JPA). The One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP) was formed in May 2021 to advise FAO, UNEP, WHO and WOAH on One Health issues. This includes recommendations for research on emerging disease threats, and the development of a long-term global plan of action to avert outbreaks of diseases like H5N1 avian influenza, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and, possibly, COVID-19. The panel will also have a role in investigating the impact of human activity on the environment and wildlife habitats, and how this drives disease threats. Critical areas include food production and distribution, urbanization and infrastructure development, international travel and trade, activities that lead to biodiversity loss and climate change, and those that put increased pressure on the natural resource base – all of which can lead to the emergence of zoonotic diseases."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance", "question": "What is antimicrobial resistance?", "answer": "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms such as \r\nbacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the \r\nmedications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the\r\n microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often \r\nreferred to as “superbugs”. This is a major concern because a resistant \r\ninfection may kill, can spread to others, and imposes huge costs to \r\nindividuals and society. Antimicrobial resistance is the broader term for resistance in\r\n different types of microorganisms and encompasses resistance to \r\nantibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal drugs. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally but is facilitated \r\nby the inappropriate use of medicines, for example using antibiotics for\r\n viral infections such as cold or flu, or sharing antibiotics. \r\nLow-quality medicines, wrong prescriptions and poor infection prevention\r\n and control also encourage the development and spread of drug \r\nresistance. Lack of government commitment to address these issues, poor \r\nsurveillance and a diminishing arsenal of tools to diagnose, treat and \r\nprevent also hinder the control of antimicrobial drug resistance."}
{"topic": "/antimicrobial-resistance", "question": "Does stopping a course of antibiotics early lead to antibiotic resistance?", "answer": "There has been a lot of research into how long antibiotic \r\ncourses should be, to determine the shortest possible length of course \r\nneeded to completely kill all bacteria. If you are being treated for an infection, the kind of \r\nantibiotics your doctor prescribes and the length of the course should \r\nbe based on the best evidence. Feeling better, or an improvement in symptoms, does not always\r\n mean that the infection has completely gone. Your doctor has had years \r\nof training and has access to the latest evidence – so always follow \r\ntheir advice. Evidence is emerging that shorter courses of antibiotics may \r\nbe just as effective as longer courses for some infections. Shorter \r\ntreatments make more sense – they are more likely to be completed \r\nproperly, have fewer side effects and also likely to be cheaper. They \r\nalso reduce the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, thereby reducing \r\nthe speed by which the pathogen develops resistance. WHO publishes guidelines about treatments for different \r\ninfections and recommends treatment durations and doses of antibiotics \r\nbased on the best clinical evidence for each case. We continuously \r\nreview the latest research so that we can provide updated \r\nrecommendations to health professionals."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "What is the SDG Health Price Tag?", "answer": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Health Price Tag is a \r\nmodel that estimates the financial investments needed to strengthen \r\nhealth systems in order to reach the health targets in the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2030. The WHO SDG Heath Price Tag is a ballpark estimate, and is not\r\n prescriptive for what countries should spend. It shows the areas in \r\nwhich major investments are needed, and forecasts the extent to which \r\ndifferent countries can afford them."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "What are the main findings?", "answer": "The SDG Health Price Tag models two scenarios: an \"ambitious\" \r\nscenario in which countries reach the health targets in the SDGs by \r\n2030, and a “progress” scenario in which countries get two thirds or \r\nmore of the way to the targets. In both scenarios, health systems investments such as \r\nemploying more health workers; building and operating new clinics, \r\nhospitals and laboratories; and buying medical equipment account for \r\nabout 75% of the total cost. The remainder is for medicines, vaccines, \r\nsyringes and other commodities used to prevent or treat specific \r\ndiseases, and for activities such as training, health campaigns and \r\noutreach to vulnerable communities. Under the \"ambitious\" scenario, achieving the SDG health \r\ntargets would require new investments increasing over time from an \r\ninitial US$ 134 billion annually to $371 billion, or $58 per person, by \r\n2030. The model includes adding more than 23 million health workers,\r\n and building more than 415 000 new health facilities, 91% of which \r\nwould be primary health care centres. The investments could prevent 97 million premature deaths – \r\none every five seconds over 15 years – including more than 50 million \r\ninfants and children who are either stillborn or die before their fifth \r\nbirthday, and 20 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as \r\ncardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Life expectancy would \r\nincrease by between 3.1 and 8.4 years, and 535 million years of healthy \r\nliving would be added across the 67 countries. The \"progress\" scenario would require new investments \r\nincreasing from an initial US$ 104 billion a year to $274 billion, or \r\n$41 per person, by 2030. These investments would prevent about 71 \r\nmillion premature deaths, add more than 14 million new health workers, \r\nand nearly 378 000 new health facilities, 93% of which would be primary \r\nhealth care centres."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "Can countries afford it?", "answer": "Yes, most can. WHO analysis shows that 85% of the costs can be\r\n met with domestic resources, although as many as 32 of the world’s \r\npoorest countries will face an annual gap of up to US$ 54 billion and \r\nwill continue to need external assistance. Investments made under the ambitious scenario would boost \r\nhealth spending as a proportion of gross domestic product across all 67 \r\ncountries from an average of 5.6% to 7.5%. The progress scenario would \r\nboost health spending as a proportion of GDP to an average of 6.5%. The \r\nglobal average for health spending as a proportion of GDP is 9.9%. \r\nAlthough higher spending does not necessarily translate to improved \r\nhealth, making the right investments at the right time can. WHO encourages countries to set nationally appropriate \r\nspending targets for quality investments in essential public services in\r\n the health sector as well as other social sectors, consistent with \r\nnational sustainable development strategies. Governments can generate more public revenue by broadening the\r\n tax base, increasing the efficiency of tax collection, and reducing \r\ncorruption and international tax avoidance. Parallel to this, \r\ngovernments should also ensure that an appropriate share of public \r\nrevenue is allocated to health. However, it’s not only how much is spent but how it’s spent. At the same level of spending, WHO observes a significant \r\nvariance in health system performance across countries due to differing \r\nlevels of efficiency."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "How were these estimates produced?", "answer": "WHO analysed existing databases to assess country data on \r\ndisease burden, health service coverage, and health system performance. \r\nWe grouped countries into five categories in terms of their health \r\nsystems and financial capacity. We considered how health services could be scaled up through \r\nfour categories of health service delivery from policy and community \r\ninterventions like taxes and regulations up to hospital services. Next, \r\nwe identified what investments are needed to bring countries towards \r\nglobal benchmarks in terms of health system performance targets, health \r\nservice coverage, and overall health outcomes. These activities and \r\ninvestments are modelled by country and by year, and multiplied by \r\ncountry-specific prices. Investments are modelled to increase over time.\r\n The majority of the analysis was done in the OneHealth Tool, a software\r\n application whose development is overseen by WHO and other UN agencies."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "What is not included in your estimates? What is missing?", "answer": "For some areas there is a lack of good data and projection \r\nmodels, such as injury prevention, road traffic accidents, chemical \r\npoisoning, and hepatitis, so we have not included them in the analysis. Interventions were also excluded for which current coverage \r\nlevels could not be identified and/or there is limited agreement on what\r\n target levels to strive for (such as for oral health, assistive \r\ntechnologies, and consumables like gloves and laboratory reagents). The costs of research and development were not included. While\r\n technological innovation will be important to enable us to deliver \r\nservices more efficiently in the future, there is considerable \r\nuncertainty around the size of future gains and when those will happen. \r\nMoreover, while future technologies may be more cost-effective, they \r\nalso may be more expensive and require additional resources than what we\r\n have modelled. Given the uncertainty, we did not attempt to model a \r\nforecasted change in technology whereby more effective technologies are \r\nimplemented than what is available today. For all of the reasons above, these estimates should be \r\nconsidered as minimum indicative estimates. WHO plans to update the \r\nmodel with more data as it becomes available."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "Why did you only include 67 countries?", "answer": "WHO decided to include all low-income countries, the 20 \r\nmost-populous lower-middle-income countries, and the 20 most populous \r\nupper-middle-income countries. Some countries were excluded from the \r\nfinal dataset because they did not have the required data available for \r\nGDP projections, and other countries changed income category \r\nclassification during the course of the analysis, such that in the end \r\nthere were 28 low-income countries and 39 middle-income countries. These jointly account for 95% of the population in low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries, and 75% of the global population. Notably, \r\nRussia is not included because it was classified as a high-income \r\ncountry when we started our work, although it has since been \r\nreclassified as a middle-income country. High income countries are not included to allow focus on those\r\n countries that face the greatest challenges in increasing service \r\nprovision and resource mobilization to progress towards the SDG health \r\ntargets."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "So what should my country spend on health?", "answer": "We have not published a breakdown of costs by country, because\r\n the purpose of the SDG Health Price Tag is to give a global overview of\r\n the types of investments needed to strengthen health systems, rather \r\nthan a prescription for what individual countries should spend. Countries can request assistance from WHO to set priorities \r\nand estimate resource needs through the WHO-CHOICE programme of work and\r\n the OneHealth Tool, which would closely replicate the methods used in \r\nthis study."}
{"topic": "/sustainable-development-goals-health-price-tag", "question": "Can you guarantee that the SDG health targets will be reached if countries meet these spending levels?", "answer": "No. Achieving the SDG health targets is not simply a matter of\r\nspending money. Political commitment to pursuing the targets is vital,\r\nas is respect for human rights. Making wise investments in health\r\nsystem, coupled with stronger institutions are likely to bring about the\r\nwanted changes."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "What was the process for developing the WHO TPP?", "answer": "The general overview and process for developing WHO TPPs is available on the WHO website . Consistent with the standard approach, a Working Group of PDVAC was constituted to develop a\r\ndraft TPP in April 2016, following declaration of a WHO Public Health Emergency of International\r\nConcern (PHEIC). The document underwent an open public comment period and was discussed in a\r\nWHO stakeholder consultation in Geneva. The first iteration was published in July 2016. Following\r\nthe declaration that the PHEIC was over, WHO Secretariat and the PDVAC Working Group revised\r\nthe TPP, opened a second public comment period, and it was discussed at a WHO/NIH joint meeting\r\non Zika vaccine development. The revised TPP was published in February 2017."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "For which scenario is this TPP relevant?", "answer": "The scenario faced in 2016 and today is that of outbreak response. In the context of an ongoing\r\nepidemic or an imminent outbreak of ZIKV, a mass vaccination campaign will help to prevent ZIKV-associated disease in women of reproductive age. The primary public health objective of vaccination\r\nin this scenario is the prevention of prenatal ZIKV infection, associated microcephaly, other nervous\r\nsystem malformations and pregnancy-related complications."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "What kind of vaccine is WHO asking for, and for whom?", "answer": "In emergencies, we focus on the prevention of the most devastating disease manifestation which, in\r\nthe context of Zika, is congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This is a condition occurring in newborns and\r\ninfants who were exposed to Zika virus infection in utero. For this reason, the priority population to\r\nprotect through vaccination is women of childbearing age so that when pregnant they do not\r\nbecome infected with Zika virus. Because women of childbearing age may include women who are unknowingly pregnant, or even\r\nknowingly pregnant depending on the risk of disease and the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine,\r\nWHO’s preference is for non-replicating platforms with no documented safety concerns from use\r\nduring pregnancy, such as inactivated whole, subunit based and those that use alum as adjuvant. It is\r\nalso anticipated that these vaccines, which already have licensed vaccines in their class, would be\r\nfaster to license by a regulatory authority than a novel vaccine platform. However, it is considered\r\nimportant that there be no contraindication for use during pregnancy or in lactating women, and the\r\nvaccine should be safe and effective regardless of prior flavivirus exposure. However, the TPP also outlines minimal criteria for a vaccine that support development of other\r\nplatforms, such as DNA/RNA vaccine platforms, viral vectored vaccines, and new adjuvants. These\r\nproducts may also have favourable characteristics with respect to production capabilities or duration\r\nof protection. If, when a vaccine becomes available, vaccine supply is limited, then vaccine will be prioritized for\r\nwomen of child-bearing age. However, there are good reasons to vaccinate males as well, such as to\r\nprevent sexual transmission, and should vaccine supply not be limited, males of the same ages\r\nshould also be included in the target population. Depending on the vaccine candidate and the risk of\r\ndisease, off-label vaccination of pregnant women could be considered by public health agencies."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "Does WHO discourage development of other platforms/approaches?", "answer": "No. It is not WHO’s intent to discourage development of replication competent approaches, or novel\r\nplatforms for ZIKV vaccine development. These may be critical tools for the prevention of Zika\r\noutside the current outbreak context. For example, if ZIKV is or becomes a disease transmitted at\r\nyounger ages, a vaccine platform may be prioritized that induces long-term, even life-long durability\r\nto protect women during their child-bearing years. Live, replicating platforms are likely to be\r\nprioritized in this scenario. Thus, investments in a wide range of platforms, even those that do not\r\nmeet all preferred criteria in the WHO TPP, are strongly encouraged. WHO is committed to supporting vaccine development and innovative approaches. In the WHO\r\nMission and Vision for 2015-2030, WHO outlines three strategic directions to support product\r\ndevelopment: Promote the development of new vaccines and vaccine delivery technologies to meet public\r\nhealth priorities, Establish norms and standards for vaccines and delivery technologies, and Ensure vaccines and delivery technologies are of assured quality. WHO will continue to support activities to meet these directions across public health priority\r\npathogens."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "Is WHO expecting clinical trials to demonstrate vaccine protection against congenital Zika syndrome?", "answer": "The public health value proposition for a Zika vaccine is to prevent congenital ZIKV syndrome\r\nthrough the protection of pregnant women against Zika virus infection. However, this value\r\nproposition is different than what is expected in the clinical development program and indication. It is preferred that vaccine candidates demonstrate vaccine efficacy of at least 80% against\r\nvirologically-confirmed ZIKV illness, or even against infection if this can be adequately measured. If\r\nvaccine efficacy cannot be measured due to lack of ZIKV transmission, and if a surrogate of immunity\r\nis established through animal models or cohort studies, this could be sufficient to warrant use of the\r\nvaccine. Pending study approval by regulatory authorities, data from a human challenge model may\r\ncomplement immunogenicity data. It is expected that vaccine prevention of CZS and GBS can be demonstrated only in post-licensure\r\nstudies."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "What are other scenarios in which a Zika vaccine might be important?", "answer": "The second scenario is routine/endemic transmission use . Although there is insufficient evidence to\r\ncharacterize whether endemic transmission is occurring in various parts of the world, it is possible\r\nthat Zika circulation could mimic something like Rubella, in which childhood vaccination could be\r\nenvisaged as a way to increase population and long-term protection of females to prevent cases of\r\nCZS. There are currently insufficient data to inform a TPP for routine/endemic use. If and when sufficient\r\ndata become available to warrant and develop a TPP for routine use, WHO will do so."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-zika-virus-vaccine-target-product-profile", "question": "What is WHO doing to support development of a Zika vaccine?", "answer": "The Zika R&D activities are coordinated under WHO’s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics.\r\nThis is a strategic plan which allows the R&D community and regulators to fast-track the availability\r\nof effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives for diseases for\r\nwhich few or no medical countermeasures exist.

{"topic": "/tobacco-and-the-who-framework-convention-on-tobacco-control", "question": "What is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?", "answer": "The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is \r\nan international treaty designed by countries as the most powerful tool \r\nto reduce the health and economic burden caused by tobacco. It entered \r\ninto force in 2005, and implementation of the Convention is called for \r\nin target 3.a of the Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO FCTC is one \r\nof the most rapidly embraced treaties in the history of the United \r\nNations. There are 180 Parties to the Convention, which is legally \r\nbinding, meaning that Parties are required to take incremental action to\r\n prevent tobacco consumption, marketing and exposure, among many other \r\nmeasures. The Convention contains core demand- and supply-reduction \r\nprovisions of proven effectiveness and calls for enhanced international \r\ncooperation. It also requires Parties to protect their tobacco control \r\nand public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of\r\n the tobacco industry."}
{"topic": "/tobacco-and-the-who-framework-convention-on-tobacco-control", "question": "Why must countries implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?", "answer": "Increased trade, foreign investment, global marketing and other\r\n complex international phenomena have led to the globalization of the \r\ntobacco epidemic. As the epidemic transcends national borders, its \r\ncontrol requires international cooperation and multilateral regulation. The WHO FCTC was developed as a global response to the \r\nglobalization of the tobacco epidemic. There is no doubt that reducing \r\nthe rates of uptake and consumption of tobacco will save lives and that \r\nthe WHO FCTC is the evidence-based tool with which to do it. By becoming Parties and implementing the provisions of the WHO\r\n FCTC where it counts most – at the country level – countries are \r\nworking towards a tobacco-free world and towards millions of lives \r\nsaved."}
{"topic": "/contact-tracing", "question": "What is contact tracing and why is it important?", "answer": "People in close contact with someone who is infected with a \r\nvirus, such as the Ebola virus, are at higher risk of becoming infected \r\nthemselves, and of potentially further infecting others. Closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected \r\nperson will help the contacts to get care and treatment, and will \r\nprevent further transmission of the virus. This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into 3 basic steps: Contact identification: Once someone is confirmed as \r\ninfected with a virus, contacts are identified by asking about the \r\nperson’s activities and the activities and roles of the people around \r\nthem since onset of illness.  Contacts can be anyone who has been in \r\ncontact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues, \r\nfriends, or health care providers. Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact \r\nwith the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be\r\n made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their \r\ncontact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the \r\nimportance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts \r\nshould also be provided with information about prevention of the \r\ndisease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high \r\nrisk contacts, either at home, or in hospital. Contact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection."}

Studies show that the yellow fever vaccine given as one fifth of the regular dose, still provides full immunity against the disease for at least 12 months and likely longer. Fractional dosing, or dose sparing, could be used to control an outbreak in cases where the vaccine supply is limited. Fractional dose yellow fever vaccine as a dose-sparing option for outbreak response More Q&A's on yellow fever"}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "What are vaccine experts saying about fractional dosing?", "answer": "After reviewing evidence, WHOꞌs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, determined that a fifth of a standard vaccine dose can provide full protection against the disease for at least 12 months and can be used to control outbreaks. In a mass vaccination campaign in Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016 the fractional dosing method was shown to be feasible and a promising approach to protect at-risk populations that would otherwise be left unprotected. Fractional dosing is not proposed for routine immunization, as there is not enough data available to show that lower doses confer life-long protection. Studies are ongoing to determine the long-term protection provided by fractionated doses. Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization - yellow fever page 21"}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "When should the fractional dosing method be used?", "answer": "Using fractional dosing is the best way to stretch vaccine supplies and protect as many people as possible to stop the spread of yellow fever in emergency situations. Based on the available evidence, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization affirms that a fractional dose can be used as part of an exceptional response when there is a large outbreak and a shortage of vaccine."}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "Will people who receive the emergency dose get a yellow fever certificate?", "answer": "A fractional dose does not entitle people to a yellow fever certificate valid for international travel. People, who want to travel internationally, require a full dose of the vaccine. The full dose entitles them to an international yellow fever certificate."}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "Can children receive a fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine?", "answer": "There is currently no available data to show that a fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine in children under 2 years of age will provide the same protection as the full dose. Very young children may have a weaker immune response to the vaccine than older people. Therefore, children under 2 years of age should be offered a full dose."}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "How will vaccination records be kept?", "answer": "WHO recommends that countries using fractional dosing keep good vaccination records of people who receive it so that they can be followed up later to assess how long the vaccine protection lasts and be revaccinated if necessary. These people will need to be informed that they have received the fractional dose and will require a full dose of the vaccine if they wish to travel."}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "Is there a greater risk of adverse effects with a fractional dose of the vaccine?", "answer": "The fractional dose comes from the same full dose vaccine. It has been given to millions of people to prevent yellow fever in the past. It is as safe and as effective as the full dose of the vaccine. Serious adverse effects following a full dose of yellow fever vaccine are extremely rare (less than one per one million people). There is no evidence of increased serious adverse effects when using a fractional dose."}
{"topic": "/fractional-doses-of-the-yellow-fever-vaccine", "question": "Has this method been used for other vaccines?", "answer": "Fractional dosing is currently being used for inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), Rabies and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "What is a Phase 3 clinical trial?", "answer": "Clinical trials are a critical source of data for decisions around the development of vaccines, drugs and other medical interventions. They are carried out in several phases. Phase 1: Researchers test a new intervention in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. Phase 2: The intervention is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective, to further evaluate its safety and eventually to select optimal dosages. Phase 3: The intervention is given to larger numbers of the target group of people to confirm it works (i.e. the efficacy of the intervention), monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Phase 4: Studies are done after the intervention has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effectiveness in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "Where was the Phase 3 clinical trial for RTS,S conducted?", "answer": "The Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) was conducted over 5 years (2009–2014) in 7 sub-Saharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania. The trial sites within these countries represented a range of malaria transmission settings (low, medium and high)."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "Who were the target age groups?", "answer": "The Phase 3 trial enrolled approximately 15 500 infants and young children. There were 2 target age groups: Older children received their first dose of the malaria vaccine between 5 and 17 months of age. Infants received the vaccine together with other routine childhood vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "What were the vaccine efficacy trial results?", "answer": "Children aged 5–17 months Among children aged 5–17 months who received three doses of RTS,S administered at 1-month intervals, followed by a fourth dose 18 months later, the vaccine reduced malaria by 39%, equivalent to preventing nearly 4 in 10 malaria cases. In addition, the 4-dose vaccine schedule reduced severe malaria by 31.5% in this age group, with reductions also seen in malaria hospitalizations, all-cause hospitalizations and the need for blood transfusions. Among children aged 5–17 months who did not receive a fourth dose of the vaccine, the protective benefit against severe malaria was lost, highlighting the importance of the fourth dose of this vaccine to maximise its benefits. Infants Among the younger infants, the malaria vaccine did not work sufficiently well to justify its further use in this age group."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "Why did vaccine efficacy vary between the 2 target age groups?", "answer": "Lower immune responses are induced by the RTS,S vaccine in infants aged 6–12 weeks compared to children aged 5–17 months. Possible factors underlying this difference include interference by co-administration with DTP-containing vaccines, the presence of maternally acquired antibodies to malaria in this age group, and immaturity of the immune system in the 6–12 week olds compared to the 5–17 month age group."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "What were the safety results for the vaccine?", "answer": "In the Phase 3 trial, the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with adverse reactions similar to those of other childhood vaccines. Among children in the older age group, there was an increased risk of febrile seizures within 7 days after any of the vaccine doses. Among the younger infants, this risk was only apparent after the fourth dose. There were no long-lasting consequences due to any of the febrile seizures. Among children in the older age group, a modest increase in the number of cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria was found in the group receiving the malaria vaccine compared to the control group. It is unclear whether there is a causal link between these findings and the RTS,S vaccinations; this will be further monitored in the pilot implementation programme. This observation was not seen in infants aged 6–12 weeks. The European Medicines Agency found RTS,S to have an acceptable safety profile. As with other new vaccines, and in line with national regulations, the safety profile of RTS,S will continue to be monitored as the vaccine is made available."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "What is an EMA scientific opinion based on Article 58?", "answer": "The European Medicines Agency (EMA) provides a regulatory procedure (Article 58) to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicine or vaccine that is intended for use only outside the European Union (EU) and to issue a scientific opinion on the benefit-risk ratio of the product. The assessment uses the same standards and procedures as for medicines marketed in the EU. National regulators may use the EMA’s scientific opinion to support their own regulatory review to reach a decision on licensure."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "What is the EMA scientific opinion on RTS,S?", "answer": "In July 2015, the EMA issued a “European scientific opinion” on RTS,S. The opinion indicated that, in EMA’s assessment, the quality of the vaccine and its risk-benefit profile was favorable from a regulatory perspective. EMA’s opinion did not consider contextual elements such as the feasibility of implementation, the value of the vaccine in the context of other malaria control measures, and the likely cost-effectiveness of the intervention in different settings. RTS,S is expected to be approved for use in the context of the pilots by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in each of the three countries participating in the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme."}
{"topic": "/phase-3-trial-results-for-malaria-vaccine-rtss-as01", "question": "What are the WHO recommendations related to RTS,S?", "answer": "In October 2015, WHO jointly convened the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) to review all evidence regarding RTS,S relevant for global policy. SAGE/MPAC recommended that pilot implementation of RTS,S occur in 3–5 settings in sub-Saharan Africa, administering 3 doses of the vaccine to children beginning as close to 5 months of age as possible and a fourth dose 15–18 months after the third dose. SAGE and MPAC were not supportive of vaccine use among infants aged 6–12 weeks due to the lower efficacy seen in this age group. SAGE/MPAC recommended large-scale implementation pilots, to evaluate the extent to which the protection demonstrated in children aged 5–17 months in the Phase 3 trial can be replicated in the context of the routine health system, particularly in view of the need for a 4-dose schedule that requires new immunization contacts. The pilot implementation should also assess the extent to which RTS,S vaccination impacts mortality, which could not be adequately assessed in the Phase 3 trial due to the very low overall mortality in the trial setting, and whether the excess cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria, identified during the Phase 3 trial, are causally related to RTS,S vaccination or not. The pilot implementation programme will generate critical evidence in 3–5 years’ time to enable decision-making about the potential wider scale use of this vaccine. WHO officially adopted the SAGE/MPAC recommendations in January 2016 and is strongly supportive of the need to proceed with these pilots as the next step for the RTS,S malaria vaccine.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "Why do we need a Zika virus country classification scheme?", "answer": "Public health agencies like WHO classify countries to characterize the level of Zika virus transmission in a given time and the potential for its spread. This information enables countries to prepare and respond to the threat and adapt public health recommendations for residents and travellers."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "Why does the scheme only take into consideration the presence in a country of the Aedes aegypti mosquito and not of other mosquitoes?", "answer": "The Aedes aegypti mosquito is considered the main vector of Zika virus transmission because it sustains most Zika virus outbreaks. Zika virus may be imported by infected travellers into an area that may not have Zika virus transmission at that point of time. If those travellers are bitten by local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes the mosquitoes can transmit the virus to others, potentially setting off a cycle of transmission. Studies on the role of other species of mosquitoes in human transmission are inconclusive so far."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What are the categories in the Zika virus country classification scheme?", "answer": "Category 1: Area with new introduction of Zika virus since 2015 or area where the virus has been re-introduced, with ongoing transmission. Category 2: Area either with evidence of Zika virus circulation before 2015 or with transmission but the area does not satisfy the criteria for 1 or 3. Areas in category 2 may also experience an outbreak of Zika. Category 3: Area with interrupted transmission but with potential for future transmission. Category 4: Area with established Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but no known documented past or current transmission."}

Microcephaly happens when there is either a problem in utero, causing the baby’s brain to stop growing properly, or after birth when the head stops growing properly. Children born with microcephaly often have developmental challenges as they grow older. In some cases, children with microcephaly develop entirely normally. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors such as Down syndrome; exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; and rubella infection during pregnancy.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What is congenital Zika virus syndrome?", "answer": "In addition to congenital microcephaly, a range of manifestations has been reported among babies up to 4 weeks old where there has been exposure to Zika virus in utero. These include malformations of the head, involuntary movement, seizures, irritability, brainstem dysfunction such as swallowing problems, limb contractures, hearing and sight abnormalities and brain anomalies. Other outcomes associated with Zika virus infection in utero may involve miscarriages and stillbirths. Together, the spectrum of congenital abnormalities associated with Zika virus exposure of fetuses during pregnancy are known as “congenital Zika virus syndrome.” Not all children with congenital Zika virus syndrome present with microcephaly. On the other hand, failure to observe signs of congenital Zika virus syndrome, particularly when assessed in utero, does not necessarily mean that the fetus or newborn does not have abnormalities. For example, hearing abnormalities may not be assessed in utero but only after birth. Some signs such as seizures may develop only after birth.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What events led WHO to investigate a causal link between Zika virus and complications including microcephaly and Guillian-Barré syndrome?", "answer": "A Zika outbreak in Brazil, identified in early 2015, was followed by an unusual increase in microcephaly among newborns, as well as an increased number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Zika virus outbreaks rapidly affected other countries and territories in the Americas. The scientific community responded with urgency to the rapidly evolving situation and began building a knowledge base about the virus and its implications extremely quickly. In 2013-2014, Zika virus had caused an outbreak in French Polynesia with some 28 000 people infected with Zika, including cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The outbreaks in the Americas led to a reinvestigation of the 2013-14 outbreak in French Polynesia. Looking back, this outbreak appears to have been linked also to microcephaly. Research into the geographical spread of Zika virus and related complications continues."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "Are there other explanations for microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome?", "answer": "Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly are conditions with a number of underlying causes, triggers and neurological effects. Microcephaly can result, among others, from infections during pregnancy, exposure to toxic chemicals and genetic abnormalities. Guillain-Barré syndrome is often preceded by an infection. This could be a bacterial or viral infection. The syndrome may also be triggered by vaccine administration or surgery.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "Where does Zika virus occur?", "answer": "Local transmission of Zika virus by Aedes mosquitoes has been reported on the continents of Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. There are 2 types of Aedes mosquito known to be capable of transmitting Zika virus. In most cases, Zika is spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito in tropical and subtropical regions. The Aedes albopictus mosquito can also transmit the virus and can hibernate to survive regions with cooler temperatures. Both species breed and live near or inside human dwellings, preferring to bite humans over other animal hosts.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What role does mosquito surveillance play in addressing Zika virus?", "answer": "Monitoring the numbers and the geographical distribution of mosquitoes over time (surveillance) helps to make timely decisions about how best to manage mosquito populations. Surveillance can serve to identify areas where a high-density infestation of mosquitoes has occurred or periods when mosquito populations increase. In areas where the mosquitoes are no longer present, mosquito surveillance is critical to detect new introductions rapidly before they become widespread and difficult to eliminate. Monitoring of the mosquito population’s susceptibility to insecticide should also be an integral part of any programme that uses insecticides which are substances to kill insects.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What role does mosquito control play in addressing Zika virus?", "answer": "Mosquito control is an important component of the prevention and management of Zika virus and complications. WHO encourages affected countries and their partners to scale up the use of current mosquito control interventions as the most immediate line of defence. WHO recommends approaches that tackle all life stages of the Aedes mosquito, from the egg, to the larva/pupa to the adult. Current interventions include: targeted residual spraying of adult Aedes mosquitoes in and around houses; space spraying/indoor fogging where Aedes mosquitoes rest and bite and outside; elimination of Aedes mosquito larvae in standing water breeding sites and personal protection from mosquito bites. If current methods are implemented in an expedient, comprehensive and sustained way, with community participation, along with other measures, mosquito control can be effective. In addition, WHO encourages countries and their partners to judiciously test new control tools that could potentially be applied in the future. WHO's vector control recommendations targeting the Aedes species are also very efficient against other mosquito vectors. The range of methods for reducing mosquitos include spraying the inside walls of houses, indoor space spraying, larval control and eliminating breeding sites. Mosquito control is recommended along with personal protection steps such as the use of insect repellents, bed nets during the day and at night, window and door netting and wire mesh screens.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What can people do to protect themselves from mosquito bites?", "answer": "The best protection from Zika virus and associated complications is preventing mosquito bites. This can be done by: • Wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible. • Using repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), IR 3535 ((3- [N-butyl-N-acetyl], aminopropionic acid ethyl-ester) or KBR3023 (also called Icaridin or Picaridin). These are applied to exposed skin or to clothing and should be used in strict accordance with the label instructions, especially regarding the duration of protection and timing of re-application. If repellents and sunscreen are used together, sunscreen should be applied first and the repellent thereafter. Using physical barriers such mesh screens or treated netting materials on doors and windows. • Sleeping under mosquito nets day and night. • Identifying and eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites, by emptying, cleaning or covering containers that can hold even small amounts of water, such as buckets, flower pots and tyres. • National programmes can target polluted water bodies and sewage wastes (septic tank outlets need to be covered) with water and sanitation interventions."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "How can pregnant women protect themselves from mosquito bites?", "answer": "Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and their sexual partners should take extra care to protect themselves from the bite of mosquitoes that transmit Zika. Pregnant women living in areas of Zika virus transmission should follow the same prevention guidelines as the general population (see question above). There is no evidence of health risks associated with the use of insect repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), or IR 3535, or icaridin by pregnant women as long as they are used in accordance with the instructions on the product label. Pregnant women living in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should attend their regular antenatal care visits in accordance with national standards and comply with the recommendations of their health-care providers. They should also start antenatal care visits early for diagnosis and appropriate care and follow-up if they develop any of the Zika symptoms or signs."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What can people do to be protected from sexual transmission of Zika virus?", "answer": "In regions with active Zika virus transmission, health programmes should ensure that: All people (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) receive information about the risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus. Men and women get counselling on safer sexual practices (including correct and consistent use of male or female condoms, non-penetrative sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, and postponing sexual debut) and be offered condoms. Sexually active men and women should be correctly counselled and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice about whether and when to become pregnant, in order to prevent possible adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity for at least the whole duration of the pregnancy. Pregnant women should be advised not to travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks. In regions with NO active Zika virus transmission health programmes should ensure that: Men and women returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sex practices or consider abstinence for at least 6 months upon return to prevent Zika virus infection through sexual transmission. Couples or women planning a pregnancy, who are returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, are advised to wait at least 6 months before trying to conceive to ensure that possible Zika virus infection has cleared.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "When might a Zika vaccine be available?", "answer": "Registration of first generation Zika vaccines may start in about 2-3 years. Many regulatory authorities have fast-track mechanisms for review and approval of urgently needed vaccines."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What are the characteristics of an ideal Zika vaccine?", "answer": "WHO is helping to shape vaccine development through the creation of a target product profile for Zika vaccines for use in an emergency. The profile specifies the preferred and minimal product characteristics for such vaccines. For example, administration of a single dose of Zika vaccine is preferable, but up to 2 doses are acceptable. The vaccine should protect for at least one year in an emergency context, but protection for several years is preferable. The shelf life of a vaccine should be at least 12 months at less than 20°C. Target product profile"}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What are the challenges in Zika vaccine R&D?", "answer": "Developing a Zika vaccine is complex. For example, we still face many unknowns about Zika virus disease and its complications. Evaluating candidate vaccines in areas with low Zika virus transmission is not easy. We need to develop diagnostic tests which can differentiate Zika infection from other similar viral infections. Getting a safe and effective Zika vaccine to women of childbearing age could, however, be technically feasible based on experience with vaccine development for other similar viruses, such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What happens once a vaccine is available?", "answer": "Once a vaccine is available, WHO’s leading advisory group on immunization, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, performs a comprehensive review of the evidence and makes recommendations to the WHO Director-General for the optimal use of a vaccine for public health impact. WHO issues official recommendations based on the SAGE recommendations, which permit the prequalification and purchase by UN agencies."}
{"topic": "/zika", "question": "Can women transmit Zika virus to their fetuses during pregnancy or childbirth?", "answer": "Transmission of Zika virus from pregnant women to their fetuses has been documented. Although Zika virus infection in pregnancy is typically a mild disease, an unusual increase in cases of congenital microcephaly and other neurological complications in areas where outbreaks have occurred has significantly raised concern for pregnant women and their families, as well as among health providers and policy-makers.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "How can women manage their pregnancy in the context of Zika virus and complications?", "answer": "Most women in Zika-affected areas will give birth to normal infants. Early ultrasound does not reliably predict fetal malformations. WHO recommends a repeat ultrasound of the fetus in the late second or early third trimester (preferably between 28 and 30 weeks) to identify fetal microcephaly and/or other brain abnormalities when they are easier to detect. Where feasible, screening of amniotic fluid for abnormalities and congenital infections, including Zika virus, is recommended, especially in cases where women test negative for Zika, but their ultrasounds indicate fetal brain abnormalities. Based on the prognosis of associated fetal brain abnormalities, the woman—and her partner if she wishes—should be offered non-directive counselling so that she, in consultation with her health-care provider, can make a fully informed choice about the next steps in the management of her pregnancy. Women carrying their pregnancy to term should receive appropriate care and support to manage anxiety, stress and the birth environment. Plans for care and management of the baby soon after birth should be discussed with the parents in consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist where available. Women who wish to discontinue the pregnancy should receive accurate information about their options to the full extent of the law, including harm reduction where the care desired is not readily available.

{"topic": "/zika", "question": "What is WHO's response to Zika?", "answer": "Zika virus and its complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome represent a new type of public health threat with long-term consequences for families, communities and countries. WHO and partners support countries in preparing for and responding to Zika to the fullest extent possible. The main pillars of their work, as outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Plan, July 2016 to December 2017, are: • Detection - Develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems for Zika virus disease, its neurological complications and other diseases that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This helps to measure burden of disease to guide sound public health interventions. • Prevention - Prevent complications associated with Zika virus infection through mosquito control that prevents the Aedes mosquito from transmitting Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever to humans; communicate risks to people’s health and engage communities in prevention activities. • Care and support - Strengthen health and social systems to provide appropriate services and support to individuals, families and communities affected by Zika and related complications. • Research – 1) Generate data and evidence needed to strengthen public health and community guidance and interventions to prevent, detect and control Zika virus infection and to manage its complications. 2) Fast track and scale up the research, development and availability of Aedes mosquito control tools, diagnostic tests and vaccines. • Coordination – WHO coordinates the Zika response through close collaboration with more than 60 partners and facilitates information sharing among them and with countries.

{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Where does yellow fever occur?", "answer": "Yellow fever occurs in 47 endemic countries in Africa in Central and South America. Around 90% of cases reported every year occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. Infected travellers from areas where yellow fever occurs can export cases to countries that are free of yellow fever, but the disease can only spread easily if that country has the mosquito species able to transmit it, specific climatic conditions and the animal reservoir needed to maintain it."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "How do you get yellow fever?", "answer": "The yellow fever virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, most commonly from the Aedes species – the same mosquito that spreads the Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue virus. Haemogogus mosquitoes also spread yellow fever and are mostly found in the jungle. Mosquitoes become infected with the virus when they bite an infected human or monkey. The disease cannot be spread by contact from one person to another. Mosquitoes breed in tropical rainforests, humid, and semi-humid environments, as well as around bodies of still water in and close to human habitations in urban settings. Increased contact between humans and infected mosquitoes, particularly in urban areas where people have not been vaccinated for yellow fever, can create epidemics. Outbreaks of the disease are of particular concern when they occur in overcrowded settings with inadequate water supply and waste management services that allow the mosquitoes to breed easily."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "What are the symptoms?", "answer": "Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days. Symptoms usually present themselves in 2 phases. The first, \"acute\", phase usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve and their symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. However, a small percentage of people enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. They will experience high fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with vomiting and deteriorating kidney function. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, with blood appearing in vomit and faeces. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 10 to 14 days, the rest recover without significant organ damage."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "How is it treated?", "answer": "There is no specific treatment for yellow fever but good supportive treatment of symptoms, such as dehydration, fever and infection, improves survival rates. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. Yellow fever can be prevented by an extremely effective vaccine that is protective for life."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "How is it diagnosed?", "answer": "Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose (especially during the early stages) because its symptoms can be confused with other common diseases such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis and Zika virus, as well as with poisoning. Doctors or clinicians who see a sick patient may not be able to tell that they have yellow fever from their symptoms alone, especially if they are in an area where many of these diseases are occurring at the same time. To confirm a suspected diagnosis of yellow fever, laboratory tests need to be done. Blood tests can detect antibodies produced in response to yellow fever, proving that the person has been infected or vaccinated. Several other techniques are used to identify the virus in blood specimens or liver tissue collected after death. These tests require highly trained laboratory staff and specialized equipment and materials."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "How can it be prevented?", "answer": "Vaccine is the most important means to combat yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable, and a single dose provides life-long immunity against the disease. To prevent outbreaks in affected regions, vaccination coverage must reach at least 80% of the population at risk. Mosquito control can also help to prevent yellow fever, and is vital in situations where vaccination coverage is low or the vaccine is not immediately available. Mosquito control includes eliminating sites where mosquitoes can breed, and killing adult mosquitoes and larvae by using insecticides in areas with high mosquito density. Community involvement through activities such as cleaning household drains and covering water containers where mosquitoes can breed is a very important and effective way to control mosquitoes."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Is the vaccine effective and safe?", "answer": "Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable, providing effective immunity against yellow fever within 10 days for more than 90% of people vaccinated and within 30 days for 99% of people vaccinated. A single dose provides lifelong protection and costs less than US$ 2. Side effects of the yellow fever vaccine are generally mild and may include headaches, muscle aches, and low-grade fevers. There have been rare reports of serious side-effects."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Who should be vaccinated?", "answer": "In countries where yellow fever occurs, WHO strongly recommends routine vaccination for everyone older than 9 months. During an epidemic, when a mass vaccination campaign is underway, the vaccine is given to everyone over the age of 6 months (when the risk of disease is higher than an adverse event from the vaccine). WHO recommends vaccination for all travellers (with few exceptions) visiting areas where there is risk of yellow fever. Travellers, who have medical grounds for not being vaccinated, must have those grounds certified by the appropriate authorities. Many countries require proof of vaccination against yellow fever before they will issue a visa, particularly if travellers come from or have visited a country where yellow fever occurs. Make sure to keep your yellow fever proof of vaccination safe and bring it with you when you travel to another country. Map: Yellow fever vaccination requirements"}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Who should not be vaccinated?", "answer": "Some people should not be routinely vaccinated, including: infants aged less than 9 months (or less than 6 months during an outbreak, where the risk of disease is higher than an adverse event from the vaccine) pregnant women (unless during an outbreak) people with severe allergies to egg protein; and people with severe immunodeficiency"}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Am I protected from yellow fever immediately following vaccination?", "answer": "In general, it takes 10 to 14 days from the date of vaccination for a person to develop immunity to the yellow fever virus. Additional personal protection measures from mosquitoes are critically important during this 10-14 day period in yellow fever endemic areas. These include wearing protective clothing, sleeping under insecticide treated bed nets even during the day and using recommended repellents. The vaccination certificate for yellow fever is valid from 10 days after administration of the vaccine for recipients."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Is eradication of yellow fever possible?", "answer": "Eradication of yellow fever is not feasible since we are unable to control the virus in the natural animal hosts."}
{"topic": "/yellow-fever", "question": "Who manages the vaccine supply for yellow fever outbreaks?", "answer": "In an emergency situation it is often difficult to get enough vaccine doses to protect the entire population at risk due to the limited global vaccine supply. The emergency stockpile is managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control which was created in 2001. The role of the ICG is to verify that eligibility criteria are met by countries applying for outbreak support from the stockpile and to decide on the amount of vaccine to be shipped.

The goals of the Initiative are to prevent yellow fever outbreaks and to secure the supply of yellow fever vaccines. The Yellow Fever Initiative monitors the yellow fever activities at global level and identifies priorities in routine immunization, preventive campaigns, and outbreaks, including yellow fever vaccine supply issues."}
{"topic": "/how-can-i-avoid-getting-the-flu", "question": "What is seasonal influenza?", "answer": "Seasonal influenza (or “flu”) is most often caused by type A \r\nor B influenza viruses. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, cough \r\n(usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and a runny \r\nnose. The cough can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks. Most people \r\nrecover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring \r\nmedical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death \r\nin high-risk groups (see Who is most at risk? below). Seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, from October to\r\n March in the northern hemisphere and April to September in the southern\r\n hemisphere. In tropical and subtropical countries, seasonal influenza \r\ncan happen all year round."}
{"topic": "/how-can-i-avoid-getting-the-flu", "question": "How can I avoid getting the flu?", "answer": "The best way to avoid getting the flu is to get the flu \nvaccine every year. Influenza viruses evolve constantly, and twice a \nyear WHO makes recommendations to update the vaccine compositions. For \nthe 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season, the vaccine \nformulation was updated in February 2016 to contain two type A viruses \n(H1N1 and H3N2), and a type B virus. WHO recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups \nincluding health care workers. People should ideally get vaccinated just\n before the influenza season begins for the most effective coverage, \nalthough getting vaccinated at any time during the influenza season can \nstill help prevent flu infections."}
{"topic": "/how-can-i-avoid-getting-the-flu", "question": "Who is most at risk?", "answer": "People most at risk for severe seasonal influenza are: pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy children younger than 5 years people older than 65 years people with chronic medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, heart and lung diseases and diabetes people with increased risk of exposure to influenza, which includes health care workers."}
{"topic": "/how-can-i-avoid-getting-the-flu", "question": "How is it treated?", "answer": "People with the flu should drink plenty of water and rest.   Most \r\npeople will recover within a week.  Antiviral drugs for influenza can \r\nreduce severe complications and deaths although influenza viruses can \r\ndevelop resistance to the drugs. They are especially important for \r\nhigh-risk groups. Ideally these drugs need to be administered early \r\n(within 48 hours of onset of symptoms). Antibiotics are not effective \r\nagainst influenza viruses."}
{"topic": "/how-can-i-avoid-getting-the-flu", "question": "How do you stop it from spreading?", "answer": "Influenza can spread quickly between people when an infected \r\nperson coughs or sneezes, dispersing droplets of the virus into the air.\r\n It can be also spread by hands contaminated by the virus. Precautionary measures should be taken to limit transmission. \r\nPeople should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, \r\nthen throw it out and wash their hands thoroughly and regularly."}
{"topic": "/how-can-i-avoid-getting-the-flu", "question": "Is seasonal influenza linked to pandemic flu?", "answer": "Seasonal influenza outbreaks are caused by small changes in \nviruses that have already circulated, and to which many people have some\n immunity. A pandemic occurs when an influenza virus emerges that most \npeople do not have immunity from because it is so different from any \nprevious strain in humans. This enables the strain to spread easily \nbetween people. Seasonal influenza viruses may contribute to the emergence of a\n pandemic virus; and once a pandemic virus has been established, as with\n the pandemic A(H1N1) in 2009, it can become a seasonal virus."}
{"topic": "/what-is-guinea-worm-is-it-a-real-worm", "question": "What is guinea worm? Is it a real worm?", "answer": "Guinea worm is, in fact, a real worm. It is a large nematode, Dracunculus medinensis ,\r\n which is ingested through drinking contaminated water. The condition is\r\n known as dracunculiasis or guinea-worm disease. The worm eventually \r\ncauses a debilitating and painful infection that begins with a blister, \r\nnormally on the leg. Around the time of its eruption, the person may \r\nexperience itching, fever, swelling, severe pain and a burning \r\nsensation. Infected people often try to relieve the pain by immersing the\r\n infected part in water. If it is immersed in open water sources such as\r\n ponds and shallow step wells the worm emerges and releases thousands of\r\n larvae. The larva is ingested by a water flea (cyclop), where it \r\ndevelops and becomes infective in two weeks. When a person drinks the \r\nwater, the cyclop is killed by the acidity of the stomach and the larva \r\nis freed and penetrates the gut wall. After about one year, a blister \r\nforms and the mature worm, one metre long, emerges thus repeating the \r\nlife-cycle. At the beginning of the 20th century, guinea-worm disease was \r\nwidespread in many countries in Africa and Asia. Out of 20 countries \r\nthat were endemic worldwide in the early 1980s, only Chad, Ethiopia, and\r\n South Sudan – all from the African continent – are currently endemic. \r\nIn 2015, only 25 1 cases were reported to WHO."}
{"topic": "/legionellosis-legionnaires-disease", "question": "What is Legionnaires’ disease?", "answer": "Legionnaires' disease is caused by exposure to a bacterium \r\nthat is found in water and soil. It ranges in severity from a mild \r\ninfluenza-like illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of \r\npneumonia. Symptoms include fever, headache, lethargy, muscle pain, diarrhoea and sometimes coughing up blood. The disease can be treated with antibiotics."}
{"topic": "/legionellosis-legionnaires-disease", "question": "Who is most at risk?", "answer": "Most people exposed to the legionella bacterium do not get sick and the disease does not spread directly between humans. Most people who do get sick are aged over 50 years. People \nwith weak immune systems, chronic illnesses, smokers and those with a \nhistory of heavy drinking are at highest risk. Outbreaks are often linked to poorly maintained air conditioning and water systems, humidifiers and whirlpool spas."}
{"topic": "/legionellosis-legionnaires-disease", "question": "Where does the disease occur?", "answer": "Legionnaires’ disease occurs worldwide but the rate of \r\noccurrence is unknown as many countries lack good surveillance systems \r\nto diagnose and detect the disease. In Australia, Europe and the United States of America, there are about 10-15 cases detected per million population."}
{"topic": "/legionellosis-legionnaires-disease", "question": "How can it be prevented?", "answer": "The public health threat of Legionnaires’ disease can be \nreduced by regular maintenance, cleaning and disinfection of water and \nair conditioning systems to minimize the growth of the legionella \nbacterium. There is no vaccine currently available for Legionnaire’s disease. More information: Fact sheet on Legionellosis (updated June 2016)"}
{"topic": "/antibiotic-resistance-why-vaccination-is-important", "question": "Why is vaccination important for addressing antibiotic resistance?", "answer": "Vaccines can help limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. The global increase in disease caused by drug-resistant \nbacteria, due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics, is a major public \nhealth concern. It is more difficult and costly to treat \nantibiotic-resistant infections and people do not always recover. Vaccinating humans and animals is a very effective way to stop\n them from getting infected and thereby preventing the need for \nantibiotics. Making better use of existing vaccines and developing new \nvaccines are important ways to tackle antibiotic resistance and reduce \npreventable illness and deaths."}
{"topic": "/antibiotic-resistance-why-vaccination-is-important", "question": "How can existing vaccines have an impact?", "answer": "Expanding the use of existing vaccines will reduce the use of antibiotics and the development of resistance. For example, if every child in the world received a vaccine to protect them from infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria (which can cause pneumonia, meningitis and middle ear \r\ninfections), this would prevent an estimated 11 million days of \r\nantibiotic use each year. Vaccines against viruses, such as the flu, also have a role to\r\n play, because people often take antibiotics unnecessarily when they \r\nhave symptoms such as fever that can be caused by a virus."}
{"topic": "/antibiotic-resistance-why-vaccination-is-important", "question": "How can new vaccines have an impact?", "answer": "Developing and using new vaccines to prevent bacterial diseases can further reduce the development of resistance. Antibiotics are currently the standard medical intervention for common diseases such as Group A Streptococcus (which causes “strep throat”), for which we do not yet have vaccines. We also need vaccines to stop people from catching diseases \ncaused by bacteria that are now frequently antibiotic-resistant. For \nexample, there is an alarming spread of multi-drug resistant \ntuberculosis (MDR-TB). In 2015, an estimated 480 000 people were \ninfected with MDR-TB. Similarly, new vaccines targeting Staphylococcus aureus (which causes skin and soft tissue infections), Klebsiella pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia and infections of the blood stream and urinary tract), Clostridium difficile (which causes diarrhoeal disease), and many others could protect people\n against diseases that are increasingly difficult to treat. Developing new vaccines and getting them used appropriately is\n lengthy and complex. The scientific community needs to prioritise which\n new vaccines would have the greatest impact on antibiotic resistance, \nand promote investment in these."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-mosquitoes", "question": "Q: We know that the same mosquito species can carry many diseases (such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever). Can a mosquito carry more than one disease at the same time? If so, could someone get more than one disease from a single bite?", "answer": "The mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus carry dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. In addition, Aedes aegypti also transmits yellow fever. Studies done in Gabon and India show that humans can be infected with chikungunya and dengue at the same time. Entomological studies confirming coinfection in mosquitoes are rare. The Gabon study found one mosquito specimen that was positive for both viruses, meaning that it is possible that the bite of a single mosquito could infect a person with 2 viruses at the same time. Coinfection poses a challenge for accurate diagnosis and treatment, particularly when symptoms such as fever and aches can be similar for many diseases."}
{"topic": "/health-promotion", "question": "What is health promotion?", "answer": "Health promotion enables people to increase control over their \nown health. It covers a wide range of social and environmental \ninterventions that are designed to benefit and protect individual \npeople’s health and quality of life by addressing  and preventing the \nroot causes of ill health, not just focusing on treatment and cure. There are 3 key elements of health promotion: 1.\tGood governance for health Health promotion requires policy makers across all government \ndepartments to make health a central line of government policy.  This \nmeans they must factor health implications into all the decisions they \ntake, and prioritize policies that prevent people from becoming ill and \nprotect them from injuries. These policies must be supported by regulations that match \nprivate sector incentives with public health goals. For example, by \naligning tax policies on unhealthy or harmful products such as alcohol, \ntobacco, and food products which are high in salt, sugars and fat with \nmeasures to boost trade in other areas. And through legislation that \nsupports healthy urbanization by creating walkable cities, reducing air \nand water pollution, enforcing the wearing of seat belts and helmets. 2.\tHealth literacy People need to acquire the knowledge, skills and information \nto make healthy choices, for example about the food they eat and \nhealthcare services that they need. They need to have opportunities  to \nmake those choices. And they need to be assured of an environment in \nwhich people can demand further policy actions to further improve their \nhealth. 3.\tHealthy cities Cities have a key role to play in promoting good health. \nStrong leadership and commitment at the municipal level is essential to \nhealthy urban planning and to build up preventive measures in \ncommunities and primary health care facilities.  From healthy cities \nevolve healthy countries and, ultimately, a healthier world."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What are electromagnetic fields and where do they come from?", "answer": "Electric fields are created by differences in voltage: the higher the voltage, the stronger will be the resultant field. Magnetic fields are created when electric current flows: the greater the current, the stronger the magnetic field. An electric field will exist even when there is no current flowing. If current does flow, the strength of the magnetic field will vary with power consumption but the electric field strength will be constant. Natural sources of electromagnetic fields Electromagnetic fields are present everywhere in our environment but are invisible to the human eye. Electric fields are produced by the local build-up of electric charges in the atmosphere associated with thunderstorms. The earth's magnetic field causes a compass needle to orient in a North-South direction and is used by birds and fish for navigation. Human-made sources of electromagnetic fields Besides natural sources the electromagnetic spectrum also includes fields generated by human-made sources: X-rays are employed to diagnose a broken limb after a sport accident. The electricity that comes out of every power socket has associated low frequency electromagnetic fields. And various kinds of higher frequency radiowaves are used to transmit information – whether via TV antennas, radio stations or mobile phone base stations."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What makes the various forms of electromagnetic fields so different?", "answer": "One of the main characteristics which defines an electromagnetic field (EMF) is its frequency or its corresponding wavelength. Fields of different frequencies interact with the body in different ways. One can imagine electromagnetic waves as series of very regular waves that travel at an enormous speed, the speed of light. The frequency simply describes the number of oscillations or cycles per second, while the term wavelength describes the distance between one wave and the next. Hence wavelength and frequency are inseparably intertwined: the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength. A simple analogy should help to illustrate the concept: Tie a long rope to a door handle and keep hold of the free end. Moving it up and then down slowly will generate a single big wave; more rapid motion will generate a whole series of small waves. The length of the rope remains constant, therefore, the more waves you generate (higher frequency) the smaller will be the distance between them (shorter wavelength)."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?", "answer": "Exposure to electromagnetic fields is not a new phenomenon. However, during the 20th century, environmental exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields has been steadily increasing as growing electricity demand, ever-advancing technologies and changes in social behaviour have created more and more artificial sources. Everyone is exposed to a complex mix of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, from the generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipment, to telecommunications and broadcasting. Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields. For example, nerves relay signals by transmitting electric impulses. Most biochemical reactions from digestion to brain activities go along with the rearrangement of charged particles. Even the heart is electrically active - an activity that your doctor can trace with the help of an electrocardiogram. Low-frequency electric fields influence the human body just as they influence any other material made up of charged particles. When electric fields act on conductive materials, they influence the distribution of electric charges at their surface. They cause current to flow through the body to the ground. Low-frequency magnetic fields induce circulating currents within the human body. The strength of these currents depends on the intensity of the outside magnetic field. If sufficiently large, these currents could cause stimulation of nerves and muscles or affect other biological processes. Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects. Heating is the main biological effect of the electromagnetic fields of radiofrequency fields. In microwave ovens this fact is employed to warm up food. The levels of radiofrequency fields to which people are normally exposed are very much lower than those needed to produce significant heating. The heating effect of radiowaves forms the underlying basis for current guidelines. Scientists are also investigating the possibility that effects below the threshold level for body heating occur as a result of long-term exposure. To date, no adverse health effects from low level, long-term exposure to radiofrequency or power frequency fields have been confirmed, but scientists are actively continuing to research this area."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "Biological effects or health effects? What is a health hazard?", "answer": "Biological effects are measurable responses to a stimulus or to a change in the environment. These changes are not necessarily harmful to your health. For example, listening to music, reading a book, eating an apple or playing tennis will produce a range of biological effects. Nevertheless, none of these activities is expected to cause health effects. The body has sophisticated mechanisms to adjust to the many and varied influences we encounter in our environment. Ongoing change forms a normal part of our lives. But, of course, the body does not possess adequate compensation mechanisms for all biological effects. Changes that are irreversible and stress the system for long periods of time may constitute a health hazard. An adverse health effect causes detectable impairment of the health of the exposed individual or of his or her offspring; a biological effect, on the other hand, may or may not result in an adverse health effect. It is not disputed that electromagnetic fields above certain levels can trigger biological effects. Experiments with healthy volunteers indicate that short-term exposure at the levels present in the environment or in the home do not cause any apparent detrimental effects. Exposures to higher levels that might be harmful are restricted by national and international guidelines. The current debate is centred on whether long-term low level exposure can evoke biological responses and influence people's well being. Widespread concerns for health A look at the news headlines of recent years allows some insight into the various areas of public concern. Over the course of the past decade, numerous electromagnetic field sources have become the focus of health concerns, including power lines, microwave ovens, computer and TV screens, security devices, radars and most recently mobile phones and their base stations. The International EMF Project In response to growing public health concerns over possible health effects from exposure to an ever increasing number and diversity of electromagnetic field sources, in 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a large, multidisciplinary research effort. The International EMF Project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions. Conclusions from scientific research In the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research. Effects on general health Some members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies. Effects on pregnancy outcome Many different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents). Cataracts General eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public. Electromagnetic fields and cancer Despite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults. A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues. Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and depression Some individuals report \"hypersensitivity\" to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure. There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject. The focus of current and future research Much effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990's. The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels. Key points A wide range of environmental influences causes biological effects. 'Biological effect' does not equal 'health hazard'. Special research is needed to identify and measure health hazards. At low frequencies, external electric and magnetic fields induce small circulating currents within the body. In virtually all ordinary environments, the levels of induced currents inside the body are too small to produce obvious effects. The main effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is heating of body tissues. There is no doubt that short-term exposure to very high levels of electromagnetic fields can be harmful to health. Current public concern focuses on possible long-term health effects caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below those required to trigger acute biological responses. WHO's International EMF Project was launched to provide scientifically sound and objective answers to public concerns about possible hazards of low level electromagnetic fields. Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health. The focus of international research is the investigation of possible links between cancer and electromagnetic fields, at power line and radiofrequencies."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What is the current state of research?", "answer": "If electromagnetic fields constitute a health hazard, there will be consequences in all industrialized countries. The public demands concrete answers to the ever more pressing question, whether everyday electromagnetic fields cause adverse health effects. The media often seem to have definitive answers. However, one should judge these reports with caution and take into account that the primary interest of the media is not education. A journalist may select and report a story driven by a range of non-technical reasons: journalists compete with one another for time and space and different journals and newspapers compete for circulation numbers. Novel sensational headlines that are relevant to as many people as possible aid them in achieving these goals - bad news is not only the big news, it is often the only news we hear. The large number of studies which suggest that electromagnetic fields are harmless receive little if any coverage. Science cannot provide a guarantee of absolute safety yet but the development of research is reassuring overall. Different types of studies are needed A mix of studies in different research areas is essential for the evaluation of a potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields. Different types of studies investigate distinct aspects of the problem. Laboratory studies on cells aim to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms that link electromagnetic field exposure to biological effects. They try to identify mechanisms based on molecular or cellular changes that are brought about by the electromagnetic field - such a change would provide clues to how a physical force is converted into a biological action within the body. In these studies, single cells or tissues are removed from their normal living environment which may inactivate possible compensation mechanisms. Another type of study, involving animals, is more closely related to real life situations. These studies provide evidence that is more directly relevant to establishing safe exposure levels in humans and often employ several different field levels to investigate dose-response relationships. Epidemiological studies or human health studies are another direct source of information on long-term effects of exposure. These studies investigate the cause and distribution of diseases in real life situations, in communities and occupational groups. Researchers try to establish if there is a statistical association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the incidence of a specific disease or adverse health effect. However, epidemiological studies are costly. More importantly, they involve measurements on very complex human populations and are difficult to control sufficiently well to detect small effects. For these reasons, scientists evaluate all relevant evidence when deciding about potential health hazards, including epidemiology, animal, and cellular studies. Interpretation of epidemiological studies Epidemiological studies alone typically cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship, mainly because they detect only statistical associations between exposure and disease, which may or may not be caused by the exposure. Imagine a hypothetical study showing a link between electromagnetic field exposure in electrical workers of the company \"X-Electricity\" and an increased risk of cancer. Even if a statistical association is observed, it could also be due to incomplete data on other factors in the workplace. For example, electrical workers may have been exposed to chemical solvents with the potential to cause cancer. Moreover, an observed statistical association may be due only to statistical effects, or the study itself may have suffered from some problem with its design. Therefore, finding an association between some agent and a specific disease does not necessarily mean that the agent caused the disease. Establishing causality requires that an investigator consider many factors. The case for a cause-and-effect link is strengthened if there is a consistent and strong association between exposure and effect, a clear dose-response relationship, a credible biological explanation, support provided by relevant animal studies, and above all consistency between studies. These factors have generally been absent in studies involving electromagnetic fields and cancer. This is one of the strongest reasons why scientists have generally been reluctant to conclude that weak electromagnetic fields have health effects. Difficulties in ruling out the possibility of very small risks \"The absence of evidence of detrimental effects does not seem to suffice in modern society. The evidence of their absence is demanded more and more instead\". (Barnabas Kunsch, Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf) \"There is no convincing evidence for an adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields\" or \"A cause-effect link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has not been confirmed\" are typical of the conclusions that have been reached by expert committees that have examined the issue. This sounds as if science wanted to avoid giving an answer. Then why should research continue if scientists have already shown that there is no effect? The answer is simple: Human health studies are very good at identifying large effects, such as a connection between smoking and cancer. Unfortunately, they are less able to distinguish a small effect from no effect at all. If electromagnetic fields at typical environmental levels were strong carcinogens, then it would have been easy to have shown that by now. By contrast, if low level electromagnetic fields are a weak carcinogen, or even a strong carcinogen to a small group of people in the larger population, that would be far more difficult to demonstrate. In fact, even if a large study shows no association we can never be entirely sure that there is no relationship. The absence of an effect could mean that there really is none. But just as well it could mean that the effect is simply undetectable with our method of measurement. Therefore, negative results are generally less convincing than strong positive ones. The most difficult situation of all, which unfortunately has developed with epidemiology studies involving electromagnetic fields, is a collection of studies with weak positive results, which however are inconsistent among each other. In that situation, scientists themselves are likely to be divided about the significance of the data. However, for the reasons explained above, most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life. What's in the future? The main aim of WHO's International EMF Project is to initiate and co-ordinate research worldwide to produce a well-founded response to public concerns. This evaluation will integrate results from cellular, animal and human health studies to allow as comprehensive a health risk assessment as possible. A holistic assessment of a variety of relevant and reliable studies will provide the most reliable answer possible about the adverse health effects, if any exist, of long term exposure to weak electromagnetic fields. One way to illustrate the necessity of evidence from different types of experiments is a crossword. To be able to read the given crossword's solution with absolute CERTAINTY nine questions must be answered. Assuming we can only answer three of these, we might be able to guess the solution. However, the three given letters may also be part of a very different word. Every additional answer will increase our own confidence. In fact, science will probably never be able to answer all questions, but the more solid evidence we collect the better will be our guess at the solution. Key points Laboratory studies on cells aim to determine if there is a mechanism by which electromagnetic field exposure could cause harmful biological effects. Animal studies are essential for establishing effects in higher organisms whose physiology resembles that of humans to a degree. Epidemiological studies look for statistical associations between field exposure and the incidence of specific adverse health outcomes in humans. Finding a statistical association between some agent and a specific disease does not mean that the agent caused the disease. The absence of health effects could mean that there really are none; however, it could also signify that an existing effect is undetectable with present methods. Results of diverse studies (cellular, animal, and epidemiology) must be considered together before drawing conclusions about possible health risks of a suspected environmental hazard. Consistent evidence from these very different types of studies increases the degree of certainty about a true effect"}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What are typical exposure levels at home and in the environment?", "answer": "Electromagnetic fields at home Background electromagnetic field levels from electricity transmission and distribution facilities Electricity is transmitted over long distances via high voltage power lines. Transformers reduce these high voltages for local distribution to homes and businesses. Electricity transmission and distribution facilities and residential wiring and appliances\r\n    account for the background level of power frequency electric and magnetic fields in the home. In homes not located near power lines this background field may be up to about 0.2 µT. Directly beneath power lines the fields are much stronger. Magnetic\r\n    flux densities at ground level can range up to several µT. Electric field levels underneath power lines can be as high as 10 kV/m. However, the fields (both electric and magnetic) drop off with distance from the lines. At 50 m to 100 m distance\r\n    the fields are normally at levels that are found in areas away from high voltage power lines. In addition, house walls substantially reduce the electric field levels from those found at similar locations outside the house. Electric appliances in the household The strongest power frequency electric fields that are ordinarily encountered in the environment exist beneath high voltage transmission lines. In contrast, the strongest magnetic fields at power frequency are normally found very close to motors and other\r\n    electrical appliances, as well as in specialized equipment such as magnetic resonance scanners used for medical imaging. Typical electric field strengths measured near household appliances (at a distance of 30 cm) (From: Federal Office for Radiation Safety, Germany 1999) Electric appliance Electric field strength (V/m) Stereo receiver 180 Iron 120 Refrigerator 120 Mixer 100 Toaster 80 Hair dryer 80 Colour TV 60 Coffee machine 60 Vacuum cleaner 50 Electric oven 8 Light bulb 5 Guideline limit value 5000 Many people are surprised when they become aware of the variety of magnetic field levels found near various appliances. The field strength does not depend on how large, complex, powerful or noisy the device is. Furthermore, even between apparently\r\n        similar devices, the strength of the magnetic field may vary a lot. For example, while some hair dryers are surrounded by a very strong field, others hardly produce any magnetic field at all. These differences in magnetic field strength are related\r\n        to product design. The following table shows typical values for a number of electrical devices commonly found in homes and workplaces. The measurements were taken in Germany and all of the appliances operate on electricity at a frequency of 50\r\n        Hz. It should be noted that the actual exposure levels vary considerably depending on the model of appliance and distance from it. Typical magnetic field strength of household appliances at various distances Electric appliance 3 cm distance (µT) 30 cm distance (µT) 1 m distance (µT) Hair dryer 6 – 2000 0.01 – 7 0.01 – 0.03 Electric shaver 15 – 1500 0.08 – 9 0.01 – 0.03 Vacuum cleaner 200 – 800 2 – 20 0.13 – 2 Fluorescent light 40 – 400 0.5 – 2 0.02 – 0.25 Microwave oven 73 – 200 4 – 8 0.25 – 0.6 Portable radio 16 – 56 1 < 0.01 Electric oven 1 – 50 0.15 – 0.5 0.01 – 0.04 Washing machine 0.8 – 50 0.15 – 3 0.01 – 0.15 Iron 8 – 30 0.12 – 0.3 0.01 – 0.03 Dishwasher 3.5 – 20 0.6 – 3 0.07 – 0.3 Computer 0.5 – 30 < 0.01 Refrigerator 0.5 – 1.7 0.01 – 0.25 <0.01 Colour TV 2.5 - 50 0.04 – 2 0.01 – 0.15 With most household appliances the magnetic field strength at a distance of 30 cm is well below the guideline limit for the general public of 100 µT. (Source: Federal Office for Radiation Safety, Germany 1999) Normal operating distance is given in bold The table illustrates two main points: First, the magnetic field strength around all appliances rapidly decreases the further you get away from them. Secondly, most household appliances are not operated very close to the body. At a distance of 30\r\n        cm the magnetic fields surrounding most household appliances are more than 100 times lower than the given guideline limit of 100 µT at 50 Hz (83 µT at 60 Hz) for the general public. Television sets and computer screens Computer screens and television sets work on similar principles. Both produce static electric fields and alternating electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies. However, screens with liquid crystal displays used in some laptop computers and\r\n        desktop units do not give rise to significant electric and magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens which reduce the static field from the screen to a level similar to that of the normal background in the home or workplace. At\r\n        the position of operators (30 to 50 cm from the screen), alternating magnetic fields are typically below 0.7 µT in flux density (at power frequencies). Alternating electric field strengths at operator positions range from below 1 V/m up\r\n        to 10 V/m. Microwave ovens Domestic microwave ovens operate at very high power levels. However, effective shielding reduces leakage outside the ovens to almost non-detectable levels. Furthermore microwave leakage falls very rapidly with increasing distance from the oven. Many\r\n        countries have manufacturing standards that specify maximum leakage levels for new ovens; an oven that meets the manufacturing standards will not present any hazard to the consumer. Portable telephones Portable telephones operate at much lower intensities than mobile phones. This is because they are employed very close to their home base station, and so do not need strong fields to transmit over long distances. As a consequence, the radiofrequency\r\n        fields that surround these devices are negligible. Electromagnetic fields in the environment Radar Radars are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and military applications, as well as a variety of other functions. They emit pulsed microwave signals. The peak power in the pulse can be high even though the average power may\r\n        be low. Many radars rotate or move up and down; this reduces the mean power density to which the public is exposed in the vicinity of radars. Even high power, non-rotating military radars limit exposures to below guideline levels at locations\r\n        of public access. Security systems Anti-theft systems in shops use tags that are detected by electrical coils at the exits. When a purchase is made the tags are removed or permanently deactivated. The electromagnetic fields from the coils do not generally exceed exposure guideline\r\n        levels. Access control systems work in the same way with the tag incorporated into a key ring or identity card. Library security systems use tags that can be deactivated when a book is borrowed and reactivated when it is returned. Metal detectors\r\n        and airport security systems set up a strong magnetic field of up to 100 µT that is disturbed by the presence of a metal object. Close to the frame of the detector, magnetic field strengths may approach and occasionally exceed guideline\r\n        levels. However, this does not constitute a health hazard, as will be discussed in the section on guidelines. (see Are exposures above the guidelines harmful?) Electric trains and trams Long-distance trains have one or more engine cars that are separate from the passenger cars. Thus passenger exposure comes mainly from the electricity supply to the train. Magnetic fields in the passenger cars of long-distance trains can be several\r\n        hundred µT near the floor, with lower values (tens of µT) elsewhere in the compartment. Electric field strengths may reach 300 V/m. People living in the vicinity of railway lines may encounter magnetic fields from the overhead supply\r\n        which, depending on the country, may be comparable to the fields produced by high-voltage power lines. Motors and traction equipment of trains and trams are normally located underneath the floors of passenger cars. At floor level, magnetic field intensities may amount to tens of µT in regions of the floor just above the motor. The fields fall\r\n        off quickly with distance from the floor, and exposure of the upper bodies of passengers is much lower. TV and radio When choosing a radio station on your stereo at home, have you ever wondered what the familiar abbreviations AM and FM stand for? Radio signals are described as amplitude-modulated (AM) or frequency-modulated (FM) depending on the way in which they\r\n        carry information. AM radio signals can be used for broadcasting over very long distances whereas FM waves cover more localized areas but can give a better sound quality. AM radio signals are transmitted via large arrays of antennas, which can be tens of metres high, on sites which are off-limits to the public. Exposures very close to antennas and feed cables can be high, but these would affect maintenance workers\r\n        rather than the general public. TV and FM radio antennas are much smaller than AM radio antennas and are mounted in arrays at the top of high towers. The towers themselves serve only as supporting structures. As exposures near the foot of these towers are below guideline limits,\r\n        public access to these areas may be possible. Small local TV and radio antennas are sometimes mounted on the top of buildings; if this is the case it may be necessary to control access to the roof. Mobile phones and their base stations Mobile phones allow people to be within reach at all times. These low-power radiowave devices transmit and receive signals from a network of fixed low power base stations. Each base station provides coverage to a given area. Depending on the number\r\n        of calls being handled, base stations may be from only a few hundred metres apart in major cities to several kilometres apart in rural areas. Mobile phone base stations are usually mounted on the tops of buildings or on towers at heights of between 15 and 50 metres. The levels of transmissions from any particular base station are variable and depend on the number of calls and the callers'\r\n        distance from the base station. Antennas emit a very narrow beam of radiowaves which spreads out almost parallel to the ground. Therefore, radiofrequency fields at ground level and in regions normally accessible to the public are many times below\r\n        hazard levels. Guidelines would only be exceeded if a person were to approach to within a metre or two directly in front of the antennas. Until mobile phones became widely used, members of the public were mainly exposed to radiofrequency emissions\r\n        from radio and TV stations. Even today, the phone towers themselves add little to our total exposure, as signal strengths in places of public access are normally similar to or lower than those from distant radio and TV stations. However, the user of a mobile phone is exposed to radiofrequency fields much higher than those found in the general environment. Mobile phones are operated very close to the head. Therefore, rather than looking at the heating effect across the whole\r\n        body, the distribution of absorbed energy in the head of the user must be determined. From sophisticated computer modeling and measurements using models of heads, it appears that the energy absorbed from a mobile phone is not in excess of current\r\n        guidelines. Concerns about other so-called non-thermal effects arising from exposure to mobile phone frequencies have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could have an effect on cancer development. Effects on electrically\r\n        excitable tissues that may influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue have also been hypothesized. However, the overall evidence available to date does not suggest that the use of mobile phones has any detrimental effect on human health. Magnetic fields in everyday life: are they really that high? In recent years, national authorities in different countries have conducted many measurements to investigate electromagnetic field levels in the living environment. None of these surveys has concluded that field levels could bring about adverse health\r\n        effects. The Federal Office for Radiation Safety in Germany recently measured the daily exposure to magnetic fields of about 2000 individuals across a range of occupations and public exposures. All of them were equipped with personal dosimeters for 24 hours.\r\n        The measured exposure varied widely but gave an average daily exposure of 0.10 µT. This value is a thousand times lower that the standard limit of 100 µT for the public and five thousand times lower than the 500 µT exposure limit\r\n        for workers. Furthermore, the exposure of people living in the centres of cities showed that there are no drastic differences in exposure between life in rural areas and life in the city. Even the exposure of people living in the vicinity of high\r\n        voltage power lines differs very little from the average exposure in the population. Key points Background electromagnetic field levels in the home are mainly caused by the transmission and distribution facilities for electricity or by electrical appliances. Electrical appliances differ greatly in the strength of fields they generate. Both electric and magnetic field levels decrease rapidly with distance from the appliances. In any event, fields surrounding household appliances usually are far below\r\n            guideline limits. At operator positions the electric and magnetic fields of television sets and computer screens are hundreds of thousands times below guideline levels. Microwave ovens meeting the standards are not hazardous to health. As long as close public access to radar facilities, broadcasting antennas and mobile phone base stations is restricted, exposure guideline limits for radiofrequency fields will not be exceeded. The user of a mobile phone encounters field levels that are much higher than any levels in the normal living environment. However, even these increased levels do not appear to generate harmful effects. Many surveys have demonstrated that exposure to electromagnetic field levels in the living environment is extremely low."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What are the current standards?", "answer": "Standards are set to protect our health and are well known for many food additives, for concentrations of chemicals in water or air pollutants. Similarly, field standards exist to limit overexposure to electromagnetic field levels present in our environment. Who decides on guidelines? Countries set their own national standards for exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the majority of these national standards draw on the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). This non-governmental organization, formally recognized by WHO, evaluates scientific results from all over the world. Based on an in-depth review of the literature, ICNIRP produces guidelines recommending limits on exposure. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and updated if necessary. Electromagnetic field levels vary with frequency in a complex way. Listing every value in every standard and at every frequency would be difficult to understand. The table below is a summary of the exposure guidelines for the three areas that have become the focus of public concern: electricity in the home, mobile phone base stations and microwave ovens. These guidelines were last updated in April 1998. Summary of the ICNIRP exposure guidelines European power frequency Mobile phone base station frequency Microwave oven frequency Frequency 50 Hz 50 Hz 900 MHz 1.8 GHz 2.45 GHz Electric field (V/m) Magnetic field (µT) Power density (W/m2) Power density (W/m2) Power density (W/m2) Public exposure limits 5 000 100 4.5 9 10 Occupational exposure limits 10 000 500 22.5 45 ICNIRP, EMF guidelines, Health Physics 74, 494-522 (1998) The exposure guidelines may differ by a factor of more than 100 between some former Soviet countries and Western countries. With the globalization of trade and the rapid introduction of telecommunications worldwide there is a need for universal standards. As many countries from the former Soviet Union are now considering new standards, the WHO has recently launched an initiative to harmonize exposure guidelines worldwide. Future standards will be based on the results of the WHO's International Electromagnetic Field Project. What are guidelines based on? An important point to make is that a guideline limit is not a precise delineation between safety and hazard. There is no one level above which exposures become hazardous to health; instead, the potential risk to human health gradually increases with higher exposure levels. Guidelines indicate that, below a given threshold, electromagnetic field exposure is safe according to scientific knowledge. However, it does not automatically follow that, above the given limit, exposure is harmful. Nevertheless, to be able to set limits on exposure, scientific studies need to identify the threshold level at which first health effects become apparent. As humans cannot be used for experiments, guidelines critically rely on animal studies. Subtle behavioural changes in animals at low levels often precede more drastic changes in health at higher levels. Abnormal behaviour is a very sensitive indicator of a biological response and has been selected as the lowest observable adverse health effect. Guidelines recommend the prevention of electromagnetic field exposure levels, at which behavioural changes become noticeable. This threshold level for behaviour is not equal to the guideline limit. ICNIRP applies a safety factor of 10 to derive occupational exposure limits, and a factor of 50 to obtain the guideline value for the general public. Therefore, for example, in the radiofrequency and microwave frequency ranges, the maximum levels you might experience in the environment or in your home are at least 50 times lower than the threshold level at which first behavioural changes in animals become apparent. Why is the safety factor for occupational exposure guidelines lower than for the general public? The occupationally exposed population consists of adults who generally experience known electromagnetic field conditions. These workers are trained to be aware of potential risk and to take appropriate precautions. By contrast, the general public consists of individuals of all ages and of varying health status. In many cases, these are unaware of their exposure to EMF. Moreover, individual members of the public cannot be expected to take precautions to minimize or avoid exposure. These are the underlying considerations for more stringent exposure restrictions for the general public than for the occupationally exposed population. As we have seen earlier, low frequency electromagnetic fields induce currents in the human body (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). But various biochemical reactions within the body itself generate currents as well. The cells or tissues will not be able to detect any induced currents below this background level. Therefore, at low frequencies, exposure guidelines ensure that the level of currents induced by an electromagnetic fields is below that of natural body currents. The main effect of radiofrequency energy is the heating of tissue. Consequently, exposure guidelines for radiofrequency fields and microwaves are set to prevent health effects caused by localized or whole-body heating (see What happens when you are exposed to electromagnetic fields?). Compliance with the guidelines will ensure that heating effects are sufficiently small not to be harmful. What guidelines cannot account for At present, speculations about potential long-term health effects cannot form the basis for the issuing of guidelines or standards. Adding up the results of all scientific studies, the overall weight of evidence does not indicate that electromagnetic fields cause long-term health effects such as cancer. National and international bodies set and update standards on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge to protect against known health effects. Guidelines are set for the average population and cannot directly address the requirements of a minority of potentially more sensitive people. Air pollution guidelines, for example, are not based on the special needs of asthmatics. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines are not designed to protect people from interference with implanted medical electronic devices such as heart pacemakers. Instead, advice about exposure situations to be avoided should be sought from the manufacturers and from the clinician implanting the device. What are typical maximum exposure levels at home and in the environment? Some practical information will help you to relate to the international guideline values given above. In the following table you will find the most common sources of electromagnetic fields. All values are maximum levels of public exposure – your own exposure is likely to be much lower. For a closer look at field levels around individual electrical appliances, please see the section Typical exposure levels at home and in the environment. Source Typical maximum public exposure Electric field (V/m) Magnetic flux density (µT) Natural fields 200 70 (Earth's magnetic field) Mains power (in homes not close to power lines) 100 0.2 Mains power (beneath large power lines) 10 000 20 Electric trains and trams 300 50 TV and computer screens (at operator position) 10 0.7 Typical maximum public exposure (W/m2) TV and radio transmitters 0.1 Mobile phone base stations 0.1 Radars 0.2 Microwave ovens 0.5 Source: WHO Regional Office for Europe How are guidelines put into practice and who checks on them? The responsibility to investigate fields around power lines, mobile phone base stations or any other sources accessible to the general public lies with government agencies and local authorities. They must ensure that compliance with guidelines is maintained. With electronic devices, the manufacturer is responsible for complying with the standard limits. However, as we have seen above, the nature of most devices ensures that the emitted fields are well below the cut-off values. Furthermore, many consumer associations carry out tests on a regular basis. In case of any particular concern or worry, contact the manufacturer directly or enquire with your local public health authority. Are exposures above the guidelines harmful? It is perfectly safe to eat a pot of strawberry jam up to the expiration date – but if you consume the jam any later the manufacturer cannot guarantee good food quality. Nevertheless, even a few weeks or months after the expiration date, it will usually be safe to eat the jam. Similarly, electromagnetic field guidelines ensure that, within the given exposure limit, no known adverse health effects will occur. A large safety factor is applied to the level known to cause a health consequence. Therefore, even if you experienced field strengths several times higher than the given limit value, your exposure would still be within this safety margin. In everyday situations, most people do not experience electromagnetic fields that exceed the guideline limits. Typical exposures are far below these values. However, there are occasions where a person's exposure may, for a short period, approach or even exceed the guidelines. According to ICNIRP, radiofrequency and microwave exposures should be averaged over time to address cumulative effects. The guidelines specify a time-averaging period of six minutes and short-term exposures above the limits are acceptable. In contrast, exposure to low frequency electric and magnetic fields is not time-averaged in the guidelines. To make things even more complicated, another factor called coupling comes into play. Coupling refers to the interaction between the electric and magnetic fields and the exposed body. This depends on the size and shape of the body, the type of tissue and the orientation of the body relative to the field. Guidelines must be conservative: ICNIRP always assumes maximum coupling of the field to the exposed individual. Thus the guideline limits provide maximum protection. For example, even though the magnetic field values for hairdryers and electric shavers appear to exceed the recommended values, extremely weak coupling between the field and the head prevents the induction of electrical currents that could exceed guideline limits. Key points ICNIRP issues guidelines on the basis of the current scientific knowledge. Most countries draw on these international guidelines for their own national standards. Standards for low frequency electromagnetic fields ensure that induced electric currents are below the normal level of background currents within the body. Standards for radiofrequency and microwaves prevent health effects caused by localized or whole body heating. Guidelines do not protect against potential interference with electromedical devices. Maximum exposure levels in everyday life are typically far below guideline limits. Due to a large safety factor, exposure above the guideline limits is not necessarily harmful to health. Furthermore time-averaging for high frequency fields and the assumption of maximum coupling for low frequency fields introduce an additional safety margin."}
{"topic": "/radiation-electromagnetic-fields", "question": "What precautions are being followed?", "answer": "With more and more research data available, it has become increasingly unlikely that exposure to electromagnetic fields constitutes a serious health hazard, nevertheless, some uncertainty remains. The original scientific discussion about the interpretation of controversial results has shifted to become a societal as well as political issue. The public debate over electromagnetic fields focuses on the potential detriments of electromagnetic fields but often ignores the benefits associated with electromagnetic field technology. Without electricity, society would come to a standstill. Similarly, broadcasting and telecommunications have become a simple fact of modern life. An analysis of the balance between cost and potential hazards is essential. Protection of public health International guidelines and national safety standards for electromagnetic fields are developed on the basis of the current scientific knowledge to ensure that the fields humans encounter are not harmful to health. To compensate uncertainties in knowledge (due, for example, to experimental errors, extrapolation from animals to humans, or statistical uncertainty), large safety factors are incorporated into the exposure limits. The guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated if necessary. It has been suggested that taking additional precautions to cope with remaining uncertainties may be a useful policy to adopt while science improves knowledge on health consequences. However, the type and extent of the cautionary policy chosen critically depends on the strength of evidence for a health risk and the scale and nature of the potential consequences. The cautionary response should be proportional to the potential risk. For more information, see the WHO Backgrounder on Cautionary Policies. Several policies promoting caution have been developed to address concerns about public, occupational and environmental health and safety issues connected with chemical and physical agents. What should be done while research continues? One of the objectives of the International EMF Project is to help national authorities weigh the benefits of using electromagnetic field technologies against the possibility that a health risk might be discovered. Furthermore, the WHO will issue recommendations on protective measures, if they may be needed. It will take some years for the required research to be completed, evaluated and published. In the meantime, the World Health Organization has issued a series of recommendations: Strict adherence to existing national or international safety standards: such standards, based on current knowledge, are developed to protect everyone in the population with a large safety factor. Simple protective measures: barriers around strong electromagnetic field sources help preclude unauthorized access to areas where exposure limits may be exceeded. Consultation with local authorities and the public in siting new power lines or mobile phone base stations: siting decisions are often required to take into account aesthetics and public sensitivities. Open communication during the planning stages can help create public understanding and greater acceptance of a new facility. Communication: an effective system of health information and communication among scientists, governments, industry and the public can help raise general awareness of programmes dealing with exposure to electromagnetic fields and reduce any mistrust and fears.

{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "What is smallpox?", "answer": "Smallpox is an ancient disease caused by the variola virus. Early symptoms include high fever and fatigue. The virus then produces a characteristic rash, particularly on the face, arms and legs. The resulting spots become filled with clear fluid and later, pus, and then form a crust, which eventually dries up and falls off. Smallpox was fatal in up to 30% of cases. Smallpox has existed for at least 3000 years and was one of the world’s most feared diseases until it was eradicated by a collaborative global vaccination programme led by the World Health Organization. The last known natural case was in Somalia in 1977. Since then, the only known cases were caused by a laboratory accident in 1978 in Birmingham, England, which killed one person and caused a limited outbreak. Smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1979."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "Does it occur naturally?", "answer": "Smallpox no longer occurs naturally since it was totally eradicated by a lengthy and painstaking process, which identified all cases and their contacts and ensured that they were all vaccinated. Until then, smallpox killed many millions of people."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "How can I catch it and is it contagious?", "answer": "The virus which causes smallpox is contagious and spreads through person-to- person contact and saliva droplets in an infected person’s breath. It has an incubation period of between 7 and 17 days after exposure and only becomes infectious once the fever develops. A distinctive rash appears two to three days later. The most infectious period is during the first week of illness, although a person with smallpox is still infectious until the last scabs fall off."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "How fast does smallpox spread?", "answer": "The speed of smallpox transmission is generally slower than for such diseases as measles or chickenpox. Patients spread smallpox primarily to household members and friends because by the time patients are contagious, they are usually sick and stay in bed; large outbreaks in schools were uncommon."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "Weren't the remaining stocks of the smallpox virus destroyed after smallpox was eradicated?", "answer": "When smallpox was officially certified as eradicated, in December 1979, an agreement was reached under which all remaining stocks of the virus would either be destroyed or passed to one of two secure laboratories – one in the United States and one in the Russian Federation. That process was completed in the early 1980s and since then no other laboratory has officially had access to the virus which causes smallpox."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "Then why is smallpox being talked about now?", "answer": "Some governments believe there is a risk that the virus which causes smallpox exists in places other than these laboratories and could be deliberately released to cause harm. It is impossible to assess the risk that this might happen, but at their request, WHO is making efforts to help governments prepare for this possibility."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "Can it be treated?", "answer": "There is no cure for smallpox, but vaccination can be used very effectively to prevent infection from developing if given during a period of up to four days after a person has been exposed to the virus. This is the strategy that was used to eradicate the disease during the 20th century. New antiviral drugs, that have been developed for other diseases since smallpox was eradicated, may have a role. No studies of their usefulness, or safety, have been conducted on humans exposed to smallpox."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "Is a vaccine currently available?", "answer": "There is a vaccine against smallpox that was a key tool in the eradication of the disease. This vaccine does not contain the variola virus which causes smallpox, but a closely related virus called vaccinia. When this vaccine is given to humans, it protects them against smallpox. However, it may have rare, but serious side effects, which in extreme cases can be fatal. Since smallpox was eradicated, the vaccine is not recommended in routine immunization. It is used to protect researchers who work on the variola virus that causes smallpox and other viruses in the same virus family (known as orthopox viruses). It could also be used to protect anyone else judged to have a high risk of exposure to smallpox. The vaccine cannot be used in people who are immune depressed or immune suppressed. After the eradication programme, a second generation of vaccines was developed that used the same smallpox vaccine strains as the vaccines used during the eradication campaign. A third generation of smallpox vaccines representing more attenuated vaccine strains, was specifically developed as safer vaccines for those high risk groups with immune disorders or dermatitis at the end of the eradication programme. However as these vaccines have not been used during the eradication campaign, the efficacy/effectiveness is not known."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "Should the smallpox vaccine be widely used to protect people?", "answer": "Vaccination with the vaccinia virus as a protection against smallpox is not recommended for widespread use. No government gives or recommends the vaccine routinely since it can cause serious complications, and even death. It should be given only to those persons who have a high risk of coming into contact with the virus which causes smallpox, or who have been exposed."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "What can be done to protect people from smallpox?", "answer": "Doctors, health workers and hospital personnel around the world have been trained to identify infectious diseases, verify their diagnosis and then respond accordingly. The same system would identify any possible outbreak of smallpox even if the virus is deliberately spread to cause harm. The public health system would then be mobilized to trace all known contacts of the infected person and vaccinate them to prevent more cases of smallpox from developing. If this is done rapidly and effectively, the number of cases could be kept to a minimum and the outbreak would be contained. This was the approach which successfully eradicated the disease. Key is to have a good disease detection system in place as well as a rapid response to infectious diseases, no matter what their cause. Several governments have examined the potency and levels of their smallpox vaccine stocks, and to consider whether, and under what circumstances, to obtain additional supplies."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "I had the vaccination when I was a child. Am I still protected?", "answer": "Anyone who has been vaccinated against smallpox (in most countries, this means anyone aged 40 or over) will have some level of protection. The vaccination may not still be fully effective, but it is likely to protect you from the worst effects of the disease. However, if you were directly exposed to the virus which causes smallpox, a repeat vaccination would be recommended."}
{"topic": "/smallpox", "question": "What is WHO doing now?", "answer": "WHO coordinates various preparedness and response activities to protect global health from any possible outbreak of smallpox. WHO receives information from governments and other sources on unusual disease outbreaks. It provides technical guidance to help countries respond to these events. WHO has displayed practical information on smallpox diagnosis, surveillance, and outbreak response on its web site. It can help countries identify potential sources of vaccine, should such a need arise."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "What are the health risks associated with pesticide residues in food?", "answer": "Pesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to protect crops \r\nagainst insects, fungi, weeds and other pests. In addition to their use \r\nin agriculture, pesticides are also used to protect public health in \r\ncontrolling the vectors of tropical diseases, such as mosquitoes. But pesticides are also potentially toxic to humans. They may \r\ninduce adverse health effects including cancer, effects on reproduction,\r\n immune or nervous systems. Before they can be authorized for use, \r\npesticides should be tested for all possible health effects and the \r\nresults should be analysed by experts to assess any risks to humans."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "“Hazard” and “risk”: what is the difference?", "answer": "Scientific studies of the potential health effects of \r\nhazardous chemicals, such as pesticides, allow them to be classified as \r\ncarcinogenic (can cause cancer), neurotoxic (can cause damage to the \r\nbrain), or teratogenic (can cause damage to a fetus). This process of \r\nclassification, called “hazard identification,” is the first step of \r\n“risk assessment”. An example of hazard identification is the \r\nclassification of substances according to their carcinogenicity to \r\nhumans carried out by the International Agency for Research on Cancer \r\n(IARC), the specialized cancer agency of WHO. The same chemical can have different effects at different \r\ndoses, which depends on how much of the chemical a person is exposed to.\r\n It can also depend on the route by which the exposure occurs, e.g. \r\ningestion, inhalation or injection."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "Why does WHO have 2 distinct processes for “hazard identification” and “risk assessment”?", "answer": "“Hazard identification”—in particular, the IARC classification\r\n of substances in terms of their carcinogenicity—is the first step of \r\nthe “risk assessment” process. Classification of an agent as a \r\ncarcinogenic hazard is an important indication that some level of \r\nexposure, for example from occupation, environment, food, etc., could \r\nresult in an increased risk of cancer. Risk assessment for pesticide residues in food, as conducted \r\nby the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), establishes a\r\n safe intake level after assessing the level of risk. Acceptable daily \r\nintakes (ADIs) are used by governments and international risk managers, \r\nsuch as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish maximum residue \r\nlimits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. MRLs are enforced by national \r\nauthorities to ensure that the amount of pesticide residues consumers \r\nare exposed to through eating food over a lifetime will not have adverse\r\n health effects. IARC’s hazard identification can inform the JMPR’s risk \r\nassessment, and thus the two processes can be complementary. For \r\nexample, IARC may identify new evidence from scientific studies on the \r\ncarcinogenicity of a chemical and, when necessary, JMPR conducts an \r\nevaluation or a re-evaluation of the safety of that chemical as it is \r\nused in agriculture and occurs in food."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "Why was the meeting held in May 2016?", "answer": "The 9-13 May 2016 JMPR meeting was planned in mid-2015 following the classification by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer of the pesticides diazinon, glyphosate and malathion as \"probably carcinogenic\" from a hazard perspective (not risk). The call for data for this JMPR meeting was published in October 2015. JMPR’s role is to evaluate (and re-evaluate) evidence, including new studies, classifications and findings, related to pesticides and their residues in food. This is a routine process in line with standard assessment of the level of risk associated with potential hazards. While glyphosate has gained high public interest, from a public health perspective the re-evaluation of malathion was also of importance, since it has use in vector control (against mosquitoes that can transmit diseases like dengue, Zika and malaria). Therefore, the meeting was planned for the first possible date and the results disseminated as quickly as possible."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "How are JMPR experts selected? How many experts participate in a meeting?", "answer": "It is the Organizations' role and responsibility to seek out the best evidence and expertise to assess potential risks to public health. The JMPR’s members are leading experts in toxicology, pesticides and risk assessment who work in academia or national agencies. Experts are selected based on their technical ability and experience, ensuring the broadest possible international representation in terms of diversity, knowledge, experience and approaches in the areas of expertise to be covered at the expert meeting. WHO JMPR experts are selected from the group’s roster of experts following their expression of interest to an open call. Depending on the number of compounds and the range of expertise needed, approximately 15 to 35 experts participate in each JMPR meeting. All experts participate in JMPR in their own individual capacities and not as representatives of any government or organization. At the JMPR meeting of 9-13 May 2016, the experts elected two Co-Chairs and a rapporteur from among themselves. Prof. Alan Boobis and Dr Dugald MacLachlan served as Co-Chairs, Prof. Angelo Moretto as rapporteur, whose role was to facilitate revision of drafts of meeting documents taking account of meeting discussions. The recommendations issued at the conclusion of the meeting were unanimously agreed upon by the experts and adopted as final report of the meeting. Link to the full list of JMPR members who took part in the meeting of 9-13 May 2016."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "How does WHO handle issues of conflict of interest?", "answer": "All JMPR experts are specialists who work in academia or in national agencies. They contribute to JMPR in their own individual capacity, and not as representatives of their government or organization. WHO has a rigorous process in place to evaluate potential conflicts of interest. Each expert is required to fill in a Declaration-of-Interests form prior to his or her involvement in JMPR. WHO carefully checks declarations of interest submitted by experts. WHO excludes those experts who have done consultancy/work or have directly, and in their personal capacity, received research grants from industry in relation to compounds on the JMPR's agenda or having other forms of economic relations that may undermine their neutrality. In addition, experts who have been in charge of a dossier at national level are not put in charge of the same dossier for JMPR. As for all WHO expert meetings, this process has been applied to each of the WHO panel members who participated in the JMPR meeting held on 9-13 May 2016. No expert has previously been involved in the assessments of the three chemicals that JMPR reviewed in their professional capacities. In WHO’s view, no expert was deemed to have had a conflict of interest."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "Have some JMPR experts had relations with industry?", "answer": "WHO seeks the advice of the world’s foremost experts active in various disciplines. It is therefore not surprising that a JMPR member maintains or has had some kind of contact with industry. In order to manage conflicts of interest properly, it is necessary to understand the nature and extent of that contact and review it before the JMPR’s work begins, so that WHO can take decisions on whether the member in question will be biased in their positions. Some experts listed on WHO’s rosters have been involved in activities of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), a non-profit scientific forum for scientists working in toxicology, food safety, risk assessment and other areas. ILSI receives grants from governments, industry and other sources. None of the experts involved in the JMPR lead or co-lead ILSI. Where some experts have participated in ILSI working groups dealing with development and improvement of chemical risk assessment methodology, or have an advisory role with ILSI, these functions are not remunerated and are directly due to their scientific excellence and international recognition."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "Does WHO publish Declarations of Interests submitted by experts?", "answer": "All WHO invited experts go through the public notice and comment process (i.e. publishing the biographies and names of experts on the WHO Web site and inviting public comments). This process, alongside WHO’s internal review, aims at maintaining transparency and ensuring that the experts are free from any potential or real conflict. WHO does not disclose to the public the Declarations of Interests form received from experts. They are confidential documents between each expert and WHO."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "Are the JMPR conclusions on diazinon, glyphosate and malathion published in May 2016 contradictory to the IARC hazard classification published in 2015?", "answer": "No. JMPR, in its assessment, has taken the IARC review of these three compounds into account by taking their data and interpretations into consideration. The work by IARC and JMPR are different, yet complementary, and their respective functions can be seen as part of a continuum where potential hazards to public health are identified, and the level of risk associated with any such hazards is subsequently assessed. IARC reviews published studies to identify potential cancer hazards. It does not estimate the level of \"risk\" to the population associated with exposure to the hazard. In contrast, JMPR reviews both published and unpublished studies to assess the level of health risk to consumers associated with dietary exposure to pesticide residues in food. In the case of diazinon, glyphosate and malathion, IARC’s Monograph Volume 112 classified the three compounds as \"probably carcinogenic\" from the perspective of hazard. The IARC Monographs did not estimate the cancer risks of these compounds from specific exposure routes or levels of exposure. JMPR’s risk assessment found out that based on the weight-of-evidence approach these compounds are unlikely to cause cancer in people via dietary exposure. This means it is possible to establish safe exposure levels – acceptable daily intakes (ADI) – for consumers. In order to ensure people are not exposed to levels above acceptable daily intakes of these residues, maximum residue limits are set by governments for the combination of pesticides and relevant food commodities, often following the maximum residue limits recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "IARC found the three compounds were probably carcinogenic also supported by their genotoxic potential, while JMPR found there was no genotoxicity. Why is there a difference?", "answer": "A chemical that is considered genotoxic is one that changes the genetic information in cells that can then lead to cancer. IARC’s Monograph, Volume 112, considered all available published studies on genotoxicity and some of which had different levels of relevance for humans and dietary exposures. JMPR, in evaluating the health risks associated with dietary exposure to the three compounds, from a large number of studies available, gave greater weighting to those most relevant to humans and to oral exposure, namely those that investigate the effects of oral exposures to these compounds on living (\"in vivo\") mammalian species. JMPR gave less weighting to studies on species far removed from humans, like caiman, and other than oral exposures. This review led to the conclusion that the compounds are unlikely to be genotoxic at anticipated dietary exposures."}
{"topic": "/food-safety-pesticide-residue", "question": "Do residues of glyphosate disrupt hormonal balance of adults and children who eat food containing the residues?", "answer": "Glyphosate was tested in a range of validated \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\" assays for its potential to interact with the endocrine system. The studies considered by JMPR as adequate for the evaluation demonstrate no interaction with estrogen or androgen receptor pathways or thyroid pathways."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What happened?", "answer": "On 11 March 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake occurred off the east coast of Japan, generating a tsunami that severely damaged coastal areas and resulted in 15 891 deaths and 2579 missing people. As a consequence of the tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS), located along the shoreline, lost its core cooling capacity which caused severe damage to the reactor’s core and led to a nuclear accident rated as Level 7 on the International Nuclear Events Scale (INES). Substantial amounts of radioactive materials (radionuclides) were released into the environment following explosions at the FDNPS on March 12, 14 and 15."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What were the main radionuclides to which people were exposed?", "answer": "People living in the vicinity of the FDNPS were exposed externally to irradiation from the radioactive cloud and ground deposits and internally from inhalation and ingestion of radionuclides. The main radionuclides to which individuals were exposed included iodine-131 ( 131 I) and caesium-137 ( 137 Cs). 131 I has a radioactive half-life of eight days and can be inhaled with the air and ingested with contaminated food or water, mainly by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. In the human body, iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland. Exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their metabolism. 137 Cs has a half-life of 30 years and this implies long term risk of exposure through ingestion and through exposure from ground deposition."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What levels of radiation have people been exposed to?", "answer": "Doses of radiation have been estimated based on models and measurements for different representative groups of individuals of the Japanese population. The assessment of the doses included both external and internal (through inhalation of the radioactive\r\n    plume and ingestion of radioactivity in food) exposure pathways. A large survey of the health of residents of Fukushima Prefecture, the Fukushima Health Management Survey ,\r\n has estimated individual doses based on typical scenarios of evacuation and time spent indoors and outdoors. Based on this survey and the dose\r\n    assessments done by WHO and by UNSCEAR, the average lifetime effective doses for adults in the Fukushima prefecture were estimated to be around 10 mSv or less, and about twice for 1-year old infants. See: Preliminary dose estimation from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Sources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation , UNSCEAR 2013 Report, vol. 1 The doses incurred by workers were reported by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and by some of its contractors. According to TEPCO records, the average workers’ effective dose over the first 19 months after the accident was about 12 mSv. About 35% of the workforce received total doses of more than 10 mSv over that period, while 0.7% of the workforce received doses of more than 100 mSv. Based on the UNSCEAR assessment, 12 of the most exposed workers received thyroid doses in the range of 2 to 12 Gy, mostly from inhalation of 131 I."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What were the main public health consequences of the disaster?", "answer": "There were public health consequences related to the response actions to the disaster, such as evacuation and relocation of people. These measures were taken based on radiation safety considerations and the massive damage to the infrastructure and facilities following the earthquake and tsunami. These measures resulted in a wide range of social, economic, and public health consequences. A sharp increase in mortality among elderly people who were put in temporary housings has been reported, along with increased risk of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and mental health problems. The lack of access to health care further contributed to deterioration of health. Similar to what was observed and reported for the Chernobyl population, the displaced Fukushima population is suffering from psycho-social and mental health impact following relocation, ruptured social links of people who lost homes and employment, disconnected family ties and stigmatization. A higher occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the evacuees was assessed as compared to the general population of Japan. Psychological problems, such as hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, and conduct disorders have been also reported among evacuated Fukushima children6. While no significant adverse outcomes were observed in the pregnancy and birth survey after the disaster, a higher prevalence of postpartum depression was noted among mothers in the affected region. See: Psychological distress and the perception of radiation risks: the Fukushima health management survey  - WHO bulletin 2015"}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What are the health implications of the Fukushima Daiichi NPS (FDNPS) nuclear accident?", "answer": "In 2013, WHO published a health risk assessment from the FDNPS accident. It included an evaluation of the risks of cancers, non-cancer diseases as well as public health considerations. The following year, UNSCEAR published a report on the levels and effects\r\n    of radiation exposure due to the accident. In 2015, UNSCEAR released a white paper that evaluates new information in the peer-reviewed literature. See: Health risk assessment from the nuclear accident after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, based on a preliminary dose estimation Sources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation , UNSCEAR 2013 Report, Vol. I Developments since the 2013 UNSCEAR Report on the levels and effects of radiation exposure due to the nuclear accident following the great east-Japan earthquake and tsunami - UNSCEAR Fukushima 2015 White Paper There were no acute radiation injuries or deaths among the workers or the public due to exposure to radiation resulting from the FDNPS accident. Considering the level of estimated doses, the lifetime radiation-induced cancer risks other than thyroid are small and much smaller than the lifetime baseline cancer risks. Regarding the risk of thyroid cancer in exposed infants and children,\r\n            the level of risk is uncertain since it is difficult to verify thyroid dose estimates by direct measurements of radiation exposure. For the twelve workers who were estimated to have received the highest absorbed radiation doses to the thyroid, an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer and other thyroid disorders was estimated. About 160 additional workers who received whole body effective doses estimated to be over 100 mSv, an increased risk of cancer could be expected in the future although it will not be detectable by epidemiological studies because of the difficulty of confirming a small incidence against the normal statistical fluctuations in cancer incidence. From a global health perspective, the health risks directly related to radiation exposure are low in Japan and extremely low in neighbouring countries and the rest of the world."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "Is there a risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer among children of Fukushima prefecture?", "answer": "Given the exposure to radioactive iodine during the early phase of the emergency, WHO specifically assessed the risk of thyroid cancer. The greatest risk was found among girls exposed as infants (i.e. < 1 year old) in the most affected area in the Fukushima prefecture. Even if those levels of risk might not be clinically detectable, WHO anticipated that the thyroid ultrasound screening programme being conducted in Fukushima prefecture was likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of thyroid diseases due to earlier detection of non-symptomatic cases. There have been recent reports about thyroid cancer cases being diagnosed among children exposed to low doses of radioactive iodine as a result of the Fukushima accident. These reports should be interpreted with caution. A large excess of thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure, such as occurred after the Chernobyl accident, can be discounted because the estimated thyroid doses due to the Fukushima accident were substantially lower than in Chernobyl. Nevertheless, the highly-sensitive thyroid screening of those under 18 years old at the time of the accident is expected to detect a large number of thyroid cysts and solid nodules, including a number of thyroid cancers that would not have been detected without such intensive screening. Similar or even slightly higher rates of cysts and nodules were found in prefectures not affected by the nuclear accident. The substantial number of cases that have already been observed in the Fukushima Health Management Survey have been considered likely due to the sensitivity of the screening rather than to radiation exposure. Further analysis of epidemiological data being currently collected in Japan will be necessary to evaluate a potential attribution of thyroid cancer to radiation exposure."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "Is there any risk from radioactive food contamination in Japan today?", "answer": "Radioactive iodine and caesium in concentrations above the Japanese regulatory limits were detected in some food commodities as a result of food monitoring in the early period after the accident. Since the early phase of the emergency, the Japanese authorities have monitored food contamination closely and implemented protective measures to prevent sale and distribution of contaminated food in Japan\r\n    and outside of Japan. WHO works closely with FAO through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to ensure that\r\n    the global community receives the best advice on the matters related to the radioactive contamination in food. Food is still monitored by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan ,\r\n which informs INFOSAN about any residual radioactivity levels in food."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What are the public health lessons learned from the response to Fukushima?", "answer": "The Fukushima nuclear accident as a part of a triple disaster was unprecedented in its scale and nature. A number of lessons were learned that help Japan and all countries better plan, prepare, respond and recovery from potential nuclear accidents. These include: Evacuation aims to minimize or prevent health risks of radiation exposure. However the process of evacuation itself, especially under the conditions of a severe natural disaster, may pose serious health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations (such as those with disabilities, older populations, young children). Relocating thousands of people has caused a wide range of health consequences including increase of disaster-related deaths, psychosocial and access to health care issues. Disrupted infrastructure, disconnection of evacuees from their municipalities, reduced number of health workers and failure of local public health and medical systems due to relocation made it more difficult to address these issues. Strengthening of public health services and improving access to health care are key issues for the well-being of evacuees, in addition to mental health and psychological support, behavioral and societal support. Risk communication proved to be essential and should be carried out by trained specialists. Health care workers also need education and training on health effects of radiation."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What was WHO response?", "answer": "WHO continues to support Member States in building national capacities for preparedness and response to radiation emergencies and implementing the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). WHO develops technical tools, training and exercises, promotes international cooperation and provides an information-sharing platform with its Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN) and its global network of biodosimetry laboratories (BioDoseNet). Through these partnerships, it contributes to the development, promotion, and harmonization of international radiation safety standards. WHO supports countries to increase their Disaster Risk Management capacities pursuant to the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction. WHO collaborates with international organizations using the existing inter-agency framework and arrangements under the Joint Radiation Emergency Management Plan of the International Organizations for preparedness for and response to a radiation incident or emergency. WHO continues its efforts towards implementation of the International Basic Safety Standards by promoting international cooperation, harnessing research, providing advice on risk assessment and evidence-based policies development."}
{"topic": "/health-consequences-of-fukushima-nuclear-accident", "question": "What is being done to mitigate the public health impact of the Fukushima accident?", "answer": "The Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS) is expected to contribute to future health effect assessments. Population health surveillance will permit the identification of additional needs for the delivery of health care. Moreover, as part of the occupational health programmes, a special protocol for medical follow-up of emergency workers is being implemented. To date, the biggest challenge for the mitigation of the public health consequences of the triple disaster is the restoration of the social fabric and social trust. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction post-2015 underlines that response to major disasters should include social mobilization and empowerment of local communities. Community representatives should be involved in the decision-making on protective and restoration actions that would consider the needs and priorities of local communities. Steps towards improving the psycho-social and socio-economic consequences of the disaster should be considered. Health systems need to provide effective counselling services and social support in a team approach and people-centered care. Efforts are needed, both inside and outside Japan, to share the lessons learned from Fukushima around the world.

{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)", "question": "What is UV?", "answer": "Everyone is exposed to UV radiation from the sun and an increasing\r\n number of people are exposed to artificial sources used in industry, \r\ncommerce and recreation. The sun is by far the strongest source of ultraviolet radiation in our environment. Solar emissions include visible light, heat and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Just as visible light consists of different colours that become apparent in a rainbow, the UV radiation spectrum is divided into three regions called UVA, UVB and UVC. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, all UVC and most UVB is absorbed by ozone, water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide. UVA is not filtered as significantly by the atmosphere."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)", "question": "Is there a connection between ozone depletion and UV radiation?", "answer": "Ozone is a particularly effective absorber of UV radiation. As the ozone layer gets thinner, the protective filter activity of the atmosphere is progressively reduced. Consequently, the people and the environment are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, especially UVB. Ozone depletion is caused by human-made chemicals released into the atmosphere and will continue until the use of chlorine and bromine compounds is drastically reduced. International agreements, in particular the Montreal Protocol, are gradually succeeding in phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances. However, the long life span of the chemicals already released will cause ozone depletion problems to persist for many years to come. A full recovery of the ozone level is not expected until 2050. The incidence of different types of skin cancer has been growing dramatically over the past decades. Some people claim that this is due to ozone depletion and enhanced levels of UV. However, most evidence now suggests that the major cause for the increased cancer rates is altered behaviour rather than ozone depletion. More outdoor activities and altered sunbathing habits often result in excessive UV exposure. Raised awareness and changes in life-style are urgently needed to alter ongoing trends."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)", "question": "What is the difference between UVA, UVB and UVC?", "answer": "The three types of UV radiation are classified according to their wavelength. They differ in their biological activity and the extent to which they can penetrate the skin. The shorter the wavelength, the more harmful the UV radiation. However, shorter wavelength UV radiation is less able to penetrate the skin. The UV region covers the wavelength range 100-400 nm and is divided into three bands: UVA (315-400 nm) UVB (280-315 nm) UVC (100-280 nm). Short-wavelength UVC is the most damaging type of UV radiation. However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface. Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere. The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers."}
{"topic": "/radiation-ultraviolet-(uv)", "question": "Which environmental factors affect a person's UV exposure?", "answer": "Time of year and time of day UV levels vary mainly with the height of the sun in the sky and in mid-latitudes are highest during the summer months during the 4-hour period around solar noon. During these times the sun's rays take the most direct path to earth. In contrast, during early morning or late afternoon hours the sun's rays pass at a greater angle through the atmosphere. Much more UV radiation is absorbed and less reaches the Earth. Latitude UV levels are higher closer to the equator. Closer to the equator the sun's rays have a shorter distance to travel through the atmosphere and therefore less of the harmful UV radiation can be absorbed. Altitude With increasing altitude less atmosphere is available to absorb UV radiation. With every 1000 m in altitude, UV levels increase by approximately 10 per cent. Clouds and haze Be careful not to underestimate the amount of UV radiation passing through clouds. Many surfaces reflect UV radiation and add to the overall UV levels you experience. While grass, soil or water reflect less than 10 per cent of incident UV radiation, sand reflects about 15 per cent, and sea foam about 25 per cent. Fresh snow is a particularly good reflector and almost doubles a person's UV exposure. Recurring incidences of snow blindness or photokeratitis in skiers emphasize that UV protective measures must take ground reflection into account. UV levels are highest under cloudless skies, and cloud cover generally reduces a person's exposure. However, light or thin clouds have little effect and may even enhance UV levels because of scattering. Don't be fooled by an overcast day or a cool breeze! Even a long stay in open shade, for example between buildings, may give a sensitive person a sunburn on a day with high UV levels. Ozone Ozone absorbs some of the UV radiation that would otherwise \r\nreach the Earth’s surface. Ozone levels vary over the year and even \r\nacross the day. Ground reflection UV radiation is reflected or scattered to \r\nvarying extents by different surfaces, e.g. snow can reflect as much as \r\n80% of UV radiation, dry beach sand about 15%, and sea foam about 25%."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "What is an Emergency Medical Team (EMT)?", "answer": "EMTs are groups of health professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics etc.) that treat patients affected by an emergency or disaster. They come from governments, charities (NGOs), militaries and international organizations such as the International Red Cross/Red Crescent movement. They work to comply with the classification and minimum standards set by WHO and its partners, and come trained and self-sufficient so as not to burden the national system. Emergency medical teams have a long history of respondinig to sudden onset disasters (SOD) such as the Haiti earthquake, the Indian Ocean Tsunami and the floods in Pakistan. EMTs historically have had a trauma and surgical focus, but Ebola has shown us their value in outbreak response and other forms of emergency. The Ebola response was the largest deployment of EMTs for an outbreak (58 teams), which pales in comparison to the 151 teams deployed to respond to Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 and the nearly 300 teams deployed to Haiti following the earthquake. Requirements for emergency health response are broader than those required for sudden onset disasters and trauma. They must include the ability to care for diseases such as cholera, Shigella and Ebola, as well as teams to support populations affected by flood, conflict and protracted crises such as famine."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "How do we define an EMT?", "answer": "EMTs work under the guidelines of the WHO Classification and Minimum Standards for Foreign Medical Teams in sudden onset disasters guidance. These guidelines discuss the principles and core standards of how registered EMTs must function and declare their operational capabilities. The electronic version of these guidelines can be found from the link below. Classification and minimum standards for Emergency Medical Teams in sudden onset disasters"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "What is the work of WHO to date in this area?", "answer": "Classification and minimum standards were published in mid-2013. These standards were used for the first time successfully in November 2013, following typhoon Haiyan. The Department of Health Philippines coordinated the deployment of 151 EMTs and found the new classification system fit for purpose. A new EMT unit was set up in the department of Emergency Risk Management & Humanitarian Response, WHO, Geneva, in February 2014.Their work has included: Building a new global registration system that will allow EMTs to register their capacity and be classified. Progression of EMT coordination in Southeast Asia, the Americas, Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific. Closer collaboration with UN OCHA, INSARAG (International Search and Rescue Advisory Group), UNDAC (UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination) teams and use by FMTs of the UN OSOCC (onsite operations and coordination centre) mechanisms. Regional exercises in the Americas with Urban Search and Rescue and EMTs co-deployed. Next steps for 2015 include: Working with countries to develop their national medical response team capacity Training national ministries of health, in countries likely to suffer natural disasters, to be aware of the capacities of FMTs, and establish arrangements for the reception and coordination of teams on arrival. Development of best practice guidance and standards for FMTs to respond to the care of children, pregnant women, patients with disabilities, older people, and those with pre-existing health issues who have lost access to their medication during the disaster etc."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "What is the Global EMT Registry?", "answer": "WHO has developed a global registration system where emergency medical teams can be verified and classified ready to be deployed to health emergencies. A global registry of all EMTs that meet the WHO EMT minimum standards for deployment in sudden onset emergencies from all-hazards provides time-limited surge clinical capacity to the affected populations. It serves as a deployment and coordination mechanism for all partners who aim to provide clinical care in emergencies such as tsunami, earthquake, flood, and more recently, in large outbreaks, such as the West Africa Ebola outbreak, which require a surge in clinical care capacity. It allows a country affected by a disaster or other emergency to call on teams that have been pre-registered and quality assured."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "What are its aims?", "answer": "Improve the quality of care provided Improve coordination between clinical care teams Provide a predictable and timely response to affected governments and populations Serve as a quality improvement forum, with working groups developing minimum standards, best practice guidance, and sharing best practice between partners Provide a forum for interaction between EMT providers and potential recipient countries, including allow countries to inform EMTs of the specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and requirements for access to their country in the event of an emergency. (e.g. rules on importation of pain relief, registration as a doctor, etc.)"}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "What does the Global Registry enable countries to do?", "answer": "It enables countries to improve their own national capacity, which they are then able to use to assist other countries in emergencies. It enables affected countries to accept and use EMTs in a timely, coordinated manner. Host governments and affected populations can depend on FMTs from the registry to arrive trained, equipped and capable of providing the intervention promised. Victims and their families can expect the clinical teams treating them to be of a safe minimum standard. Each team has unique individuals with various skill sets. Identifying these differences and placing them into the field requires coordination and communication to ensure the correct gaps are filled. EMT staff help facilitate and coordinate this placement. Offers of EMT assistance are more likely to be accepted if teams have pre-registered and have demonstrated their quality. Pre-registration will expedite arrival and tasking procedures in-country. Registered teams will be working within the national and international response effort rather than apart. Donors will have surety that the EMTs registered will have reached a minimum standard and would be able to offer a preferred list of accredited medical organisations that could be supported financially and through other means. The global community is now able to build around a predictable and described clinical surge capacity and can use this registry to examine capabilities and gaps for local response to various emergencies."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-emergency-medical-teams", "question": "What is the role of EMTs in the Ebola Response?", "answer": "Traditionally, EMTs were used for sudden onset disasters like earthquakes and typhoons, with a trauma and surgical focus. Ebola care during this multi-country outbreak has necessitated unique medical knowledge and equipment, and has carried unique risks for health care workers. The progress made against Ebola is part thanks to the response by the national and international teams that run the 72 Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) across three countries. WHO and the world have learned important lessons from the Ebola response that have a wider application to the agency and the global health response community. These lessons have been used to improve coordination, quality and predictability of clinical response teams deploying with surge capacity as EMTs. Over 40 organizations, including international NGOs, military, faith-based organizations and governments have deployed EMTs throughout the current Ebola Response. Countries that have sent EMTs to West Africa include Australia, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Germany,Kenya, Korea, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, United Kingdom and United States of America."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "Why is GMP important?", "answer": "Poor quality medicines are not only a health hazard, but a waste of money for both governments and individual consumers."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "Poor quality medicines can damage health", "answer": "A poor quality medicine may contain toxic substances that have been unintentionally added. A medicine that contains little or none of the claimed ingredient will not have the intended therapeutic effect."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "GMP helps boost pharmaceutical export opportunities", "answer": "Most countries will only accept import and sale of medicines that have been manufactured to internationally recognized GMP. Governments seeking to promote their countries' export of pharmaceuticals can do so by making GMP mandatory for all pharmaceutical production and by training their inspectors in GMP requirements."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "What is GMP?", "answer": "Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is a system for ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. The main risks are: unexpected contamination of products, causing damage to health or even death; incorrect labels on containers, which could mean that patients receive the wrong medicine; insufficient or too much active ingredient, resulting in ineffective treatment or adverse effects. GMP covers all aspects of production; from the starting materials, premises and equipment to the training and personal hygiene of staff. Detailed, written procedures are essential for each process that could affect the quality of the finished product. There must be systems to provide documented proof that correct procedures are consistently followed at each step in the manufacturing process - every time a product is made. WHO has established detailed guidelines for good manufacturing practice. Many countries have formulated their own requirements for GMP based on WHO GMP. Others have harmonized their requirements, for example in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), in the European Union and through the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "Is GMP necessary if there is a quality control laboratory?", "answer": "Yes. Good quality must be built in during the manufacturing process; it cannot be tested into the product afterwards. GMP prevents errors that cannot be eliminated through quality control of the finished product. Without GMP it is impossible to be sure that every unit of a medicine is of the same quality as the units of medicine tested in the laboratory."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "Can manufacturers afford to implement GMP?", "answer": "Yes. Making poor quality products does not save money. In the long run, it is more expensive finding mistakes after they have been made than preventing them in the first place. GMP is designed to ensure that mistakes do not occur. Implementation of GMP is an investment in good quality medicines. This will improve the health of the individual patient and the community, as well as benefiting the pharmaceutical industry and health professionals. Making and distributing poor quality medicines leads to loss of credibility for everyone: both public and private health care and the manufacturer."}
{"topic": "/medicines-good-manufacturing-processes", "question": "WHO works to strengthen GMP", "answer": "WHO GMP guidelines are available online. If you require more information, please contact the WHO representative in your country, your WHO regional office or WHO headquarters in Geneva."}

{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "What do you consider as processed meat?", "answer": "Processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed \nthrough salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to \nenhance flavour or improve preservation. Most processed meats contain \npork or beef, but processed meats may also contain other red meats, \npoultry, offal, or meat by-products such as blood. Examples of processed meat include hot dogs (frankfurters), \nham, sausages, corned beef, and biltong or beef jerky as well as canned \nmeat and meat-based preparations and sauces."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "Why did IARC choose to evaluate red meat and processed meat?", "answer": "An international advisory committee that met in 2014 recommended \nred meat and processed meat as high priorities for evaluation by the \nIARC Monographs Programme. This recommendation was based on \nepidemiological studies suggesting that small increases in the risk of \nseveral cancers may be associated with high consumption of red meat or \nprocessed meat. Although these risks are small, they could be important \nfor public health because many people worldwide eat meat and meat \nconsumption is increasing in low- and middle-income countries. Although \nsome health agencies already recommend limiting intake of meat, these \nrecommendations are aimed mostly at reducing the risk of other diseases.\n With this in mind, it was important for IARC to provide authoritative \nscientific evidence on the cancer risks associated with eating red meat \nand processed meat."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "What are the safest methods of cooking meat (e.g. sautéing, boiling, broiling, or barbecuing)?", "answer": "Cooking at high temperatures or with the food in direct contact \nwith a flame or a hot surface, as in barbecuing or pan-frying, produces \nmore of certain types of carcinogenic chemicals (such as polycyclic \naromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines). However, there \nwere not enough data for the IARC Working Group to reach a conclusion \nabout whether the way meat is cooked affects the risk of cancer."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "Is eating raw meat safer?", "answer": "There were no data to address this question in relation to cancer \nrisk. However, the separate question of risk of infection from \nconsumption of raw meat needs to be kept in mind."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "Red meat was classified as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean exactly?", "answer": "In the case of red meat, the classification is based on \nlimited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive \nassociations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as\n well as strong mechanistic evidence. Limited evidence means that a positive association has been \nobserved between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other \nexplanations for the observations (technically termed chance, bias, or \nconfounding) could not be ruled out."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean?", "answer": "This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of \ncarcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence \nthat the agent causes cancer. The evaluation is usually based on \nepidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed \nhumans. In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on\n sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed \nmeat causes colorectal cancer."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "Processed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Tobacco smoking and asbestos are also both classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Does it mean that consumption of processed meat is as carcinogenic as tobacco smoking and asbestos?", "answer": "No, processed meat has been classified in the same category as \r\ncauses of cancer such as tobacco smoking and asbestos (IARC Group 1, \r\ncarcinogenic to humans), but this does NOT mean that they are all \r\nequally dangerous. The IARC classifications describe the strength of the\r\n scientific evidence about an agent being a cause of cancer, rather than\r\n assessing the level of risk."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating red meat?", "answer": "The strongest, but still limited, evidence for an association with\n eating red meat is for colorectal cancer. There is also evidence of \nlinks with pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating processed meat?", "answer": "The IARC Working Group concluded that eating processed meat causes\n colorectal cancer.

{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "How many cancer cases every year can be attributed to consumption of processed meat and red meat?", "answer": "According to the most recent estimates by the Global Burden of\r\n Disease Project, an independent academic research organization, about \r\n34 000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to diets high \r\nin processed meat. Eating red meat has not yet been established as a cause of \r\ncancer. However, if the reported associations were proven to be causal, \r\nthe Global Burden of Disease Project has estimated that diets high in \r\nred meat could be responsible for 50 000 cancer deaths per year \r\nworldwide. These numbers contrast with about 1 million cancer deaths per \r\nyear globally due to tobacco smoking, 600 000 per year due to alcohol \r\nconsumption, and more than 200 000 per year due to air pollution."}
{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "Could you quantify the risk of eating red meat and processed meat?", "answer": "The consumption of processed meat was associated with small \nincreases in the risk of cancer in the studies reviewed. In those \nstudies, the risk generally increased with the amount of meat consumed. \nAn analysis of data from 10 studies estimated that every 50 gram portion\n of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer \nby about 18%. The cancer risk related to the consumption of red meat is more\n difficult to estimate because the evidence that red meat causes cancer \nis not as strong. However, if the association of red meat and colorectal\n cancer were proven to be causal, data from the same studies suggest \nthat the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17% for every 100 \ngram portion of red meat eaten daily."}

{"topic": "/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat", "question": "What is WHO’s health recommendation to prevent cancer risk associated with eating red meat and processed meat?", "answer": "IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence \navailable on the causes of cancer but does not make health \nrecommendations as such. National governments and WHO are responsible \nfor developing nutritional guidelines. This evaluation by IARC \nreinforces a 2002 recommendation from WHO that people who eat meat \nshould moderate the consumption of processed meat to reduce the risk of \ncolorectal cancer. Some other dietary guidelines also recommend limiting\n consumption of red meat or processed meat, but these are focused mainly\n on reducing the intake of fat and sodium, which are risk factors for \ncardiovascular disease and obesity.

The most frequent health problems of newly arrived \r\nmigrants include accidental injuries, hypothermia, burns, cardiovascular\r\n events, pregnancy and delivery-related complications, diabetes and \r\nhypertension. Female migrants frequently face specific challenges, \r\nparticularly in maternal, newborn and child health, sexual and \r\nreproductive health, and violence. The exposure of migrants to the risks associated with \r\npopulation movements – psychosocial disorders, reproductive health \r\nproblems, higher newborn mortality, drug abuse, nutrition disorders, \r\nalcoholism and exposure to violence – increase their vulnerability to \r\nnoncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The key issue with regard to NCDs is \r\nthe interruption of care, due either to lack of access or to the \r\ndecimation of health care systems and providers; displacement results in\r\n interruption of the continuous treatment that is crucial for chronic \r\nconditions. Vulnerable children are prone to acute infections such as \r\nrespiratory infections and diarrhoea because of poor living conditions \r\nand deprivation during migration, and they require access to acute care.\r\n Lack of hygiene can lead to skin infections. Furthermore, the number of\r\n casualties and deaths among refugees and migrants crossing the \r\nMediterranean Sea has increased rapidly, with a reported 1867 people \r\ndrowned or missing at sea in the first 6 months of 2015, according to \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region", "question": "What are the WHO recommendations for triage and screening of migrants upon arrival?", "answer": "WHO does not recommend obligatory screening of refugee and \r\nmigrant populations for diseases, because there is no clear evidence of \r\nbenefits (or cost-effectiveness); furthermore, it can trigger anxiety in\r\n individual refugees and the wider community. WHO strongly recommends offering and providing health checks \r\nto ensure access to health care for all refugees and migrants in need of\r\n health protection. Health checks should be done for both communicable \r\nand NCDs, with respect for migrants' human rights and dignity. The results of screening must never be used as a reason or justification for ejecting a refugee or a migrant from a country. Obligatory screening deters migrants from asking for a medical check-up and jeopardizes identification of high-risk patients. In spite of the common perception that there is an association \r\nbetween migration and the importation of infectious diseases, there is \r\nno systematic association. Refugees and migrants are exposed mainly to \r\nthe infectious diseases that are common in Europe, independently of \r\nmigration. The risk that exotic infectious agents, such as Ebola virus, \r\nwill be imported into Europe is extremely low, and when it occurs, \r\nexperience shows that it affects regular travellers, tourists or health \r\ncare workers rather than refugees or migrants. Triage is recommended at points of entry to identify health \r\nproblems in refugees and migrants soon after their arrival. Proper \r\ndiagnosis and treatment must follow, and the necessary health care must \r\nbe ensured for specific population groups (children, pregnant women, \r\nelderly). Each and every person on the move must have full access to a \r\nhospitable environment, to prevention (e.g. vaccination) and, when \r\nneeded, to high-quality health care, without discrimination on the basis\r\n of gender, age, religion, nationality or race. This is the safest way \r\nto ensure that the resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to \r\nimported infectious agents. WHO supports policies to provide health care\r\n services to migrants and refugees irrespective of their legal status as\r\n part of universal health coverage."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region", "question": "What does WHO recommend with regard to vaccination for newly arrived migrants?", "answer": "Transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to host country \r\npopulations is just as likely to happen after the return of a resident \r\nof that country from a holiday in an endemic country as after the \r\narrival of a migrant from the country. There are still large gaps in the\r\n immunity of populations across the Region, either because countries \r\ndecide not to avail themselves of the benefits of vaccination or because\r\n of limited access to vaccination services. The WHO Regional Office for Europe does not routinely collect \r\ninformation on transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases among \r\nmigrants or on their immunization coverage. However, well-documented \r\noutbreaks of measles have originated by transmission from migrants, \r\nmobile populations, international travellers and tourists alike. Equitable access to vaccination is of prime importance and is \r\none of the objectives of the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020. The\r\n plan proposes that all countries in the Region pay special attention to\r\n ensuring the eligibility and access of migrants, international \r\ntravellers and marginalized communities to (culturally) appropriate \r\nvaccination services and information. We applaud the many countries, \r\nsuch as those receiving large influxes of migrants, that are including \r\nmigrants into their routine vaccination programmes. More on immunization coverage of all countries"}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region", "question": "What health care access does WHO recommend for refugees and migrants?", "answer": "Legal status is one of the most important determinants of the \r\naccess of migrants to health services in a country. Each and every \r\nrefugee and migrant must have full, uninterrupted access to a hospitable\r\n environment and, when needed, to high-quality health care, without \r\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender, age, religion, nationality or \r\nrace. WHO supports policies to provide health care services irrespective\r\n of migrants' legal status. As rapid access to health care can result in\r\n cure, it can avoid the spread of diseases; it is therefore in the \r\ninterest of both migrants and the receiving country, to ensure that the \r\nresident population is not unnecessarily exposed to the importation of \r\ninfectious agents. Likewise, diagnosis and treatment of NCDs such as \r\ndiabetes and hypertension can prevent these conditions from worsening \r\nand becoming life-threatening."}
{"topic": "/refugee-and-migrant-health-the-european-region", "question": "What is WHO doing to address the public health implications of the large influxes of refugees and migrants into the European Region?", "answer": "WHO works to: develop migrant-sensitive health policies; strengthen health systems to provide equitable access to services; establish information systems to assess migrant health; share information on best practices; increase the cultural and gender sensitivity and specific training of health service providers and professionals; and promote multilateral cooperation among countries in \r\naccordance with resolution WHA61.17 on the health of migrants endorsed \r\nby the Sixty-first World Health Assembly in 2008. WHO has been working on the health issues related to people's \r\nmovements for many years. The WHO European health policy framework \r\nHealth 2020 has drawn particular attention to migration and health, with\r\n population vulnerability and human rights. Following the political, \r\neconomic and humanitarian crises in the north of Africa and the Middle \r\nEast, WHO, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Health, \r\nestablished the Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project in \r\nApril 2012. The aims are: to strengthen health system capacity to meet the health needs of mixed inflows of migrants and host populations; promote immediate health interventions; ensure migrant-sensitive health policies; improve the quality of the health services delivered; and optimize use of health structures and resources in countries receiving migrant populations. Up to August 2015, the Regional Office had conducted joint \r\nassessment missions with ministries of health in Bulgaria, Cyprus, \r\nGreece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Serbia and Spain, with the new \"Toolkit \r\nfor assessing health system capacity to manage large influxes of \r\nmigrants in the acute phase,\" to respond to and address the complex, \r\nresource-intensive, multisectoral, politically sensitive issues in \r\nhealth and migration."}

HIA helps decision-makers make choices about alternatives and improvements to prevent disease/injury and to actively promote health. Whereas Health Technology Assessment is systematic evaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health technology and interventions.

{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What is the Checklist?", "answer": "The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is a simple tool designed to improve the safety of surgical procedures by bringing together the whole operating team (surgeons, anaesthesia providers and nurses) to perform key safety checks during vital phases of perioperative care: prior to the induction of anesthesia, prior to skin incision and before the team leaves the operating room."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why is the Checklist important?", "answer": "Surgery can be a life-saving or life-changing intervention in many conditions and the provision of surgical services is being increasingly recognized as a significant public health issue. A modeling study estimated that 234 million operations are carried out every year across the world. This translates to one operation for every 25 people and is more than the number of children born worldwide each year. An estimation of the global volume of surgery: a modelling strategy based on available data Lancet 2008 However, despite the positive impact the provision of surgical services can have on a population’s health, surgery itself carries risk. Current estimates of morbidity and mortality following surgery indicate that over 7 million people worldwide will suffer complications following surgery. One million of these people will die as a result. Around half of these complications are potentially preventable, so using the Checklist to improve the safety of surgery will save many thousands of lives each year."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How was the Checklist developed?", "answer": "In 2007, WHO Patient Safety launched the Second Global Patient Safety Challenge, Safe Surgery Saves Lives . This project’s goal was to improve the safety of patients undergoing surgical procedures around the world. The first step was to gather an international group of experts to develop a solution to the problem of unsafe surgery. Anaesthetists, operating theatre nurses, surgeons, safety experts, patients and other professionals came together and came up with the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist . All of the items included on the Checklist are supported by evidence that, if used reliably, can reduce complications from surgery. A summary of all the evidence is in WHO Guidelines for Safe Surgery which can be found here."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "We already do all the things on the Checklist. Why should we use it?", "answer": "The Checklist helps ensure that important safety steps are reliably followed for each and every operation. Many of the checks included are already routine in some institutions, but we have found that in most hospitals there are opportunities for improvement in consistency. While most or all of the items on the WHO Checklist may already be done at your hospital, very few operating teams accomplish them all consistently, even in the most advanced settings."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Does WHO have evidence that using the Checklist has any benefit?", "answer": "Between October 2007 and September 2008, the effect of the Checklist was studied in eight hospitals in eight cities (Toronto, Canada; New Delhi, India; Amman, Jordan; Auckland, New Zealand; Manila, The Philippines; Ifakara, Tanzania; London, UK; and Seattle, USA) representing a wide variety of health-care settings, economic circumstances and diverse patient populations. Data was prospectively collected on clinical processes and outcomes from 3733 patients before and 3955 patients after the Checklist was implemented. The results of the study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2009 and demonstrated dramatic improvements in both processes and outcomes. A surgical safety checklist to reduce morbidity and mortality in a global population New England Journal of Medicine 2009 Use of the WHO Surgery Checklist reduced the rate of deaths and surgical complications by more than one-third across all eight pilot hospitals. The rate of major inpatient complications dropped from 11% to 7%, and the inpatient death rate following major operations fell from 1.5% to 0.8%."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Have other studies supported the findings of the pilot study?", "answer": "Since the landmark initial study, many smaller studies have been reported that support the findings of a reduction in complications and death while using the WHO Checklist. These studies were also carried out in a variety of settings. Most recently published is a cluster randomized control trial from Norway that compared 2212 control procedures with 2263 procedures using the Checklist.

{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Hasn’t a recent study shown that the Checklist is not as effective as first thought?", "answer": "A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2014 found no reduction in morbidity and mortality following use of the Checklist being made mandatory in the Canadian state of Ontario. This does not necessarily show that the Checklist does not work, though. The paper has many shortcomings, mainly that the authors did not know how often the Checklist was actually used and the period of the study was only three months, a very short time to expect to see a benefit. What we can learn from the study is that simply telling people to use the Checklist won’t work. Implementing the Checklist takes more effort and time than the study allowed."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Why does the Checklist work?", "answer": "There are several theories as to why the Checklist has been able to produce the results it has. The original study suggests that it is multifactorial and that improvement could come from the Checklist, the formal pauses, the resultant push for uptake of technology, as well as improvements in teamwork and communication resulting from its use. One thing that is clear is that reductions in mortality and morbidity are greater when the Checklist is completed in full compared to when it is only partly completed. This suggests that the improvements seen are not due to the whole Checklist and not only one component."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "In the original pilot study, the reduction in mortality was not significant in high-income countries. Does the Checklist really apply to high-income countries?", "answer": "Mortality was reduced with use of the Checklist in the hospitals situated in high-income countries, although the reductions were not statistically significant. However, it should be noted that the study was not powered to detect differences in mortality in each resource setting and complications were significantly reduced in all settings. Since the pilot study, many other studies in high-income settings have shown a reduction in both complications and deaths following surgery where the Checklist has been used. The Checklist definitely has benefits for surgical patients in high-income countries, therefore."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Does the Checklist apply to all low- and middle-income countries?", "answer": "Four low-income countries contributed to the original WHO study and reductions in complications and deaths were observed in all those settings. Since then, other studies have found similar benefits in a variety of low- and middle- income countries. Adapted appropriately, the Checklist can be an effective tool in these settings, especially when adopted as part of a wider push for improvement in the overall patient safety culture. WHO acknowledges that implementation of the Checklist in low- and middle-income settings will imply special considerations. Limited availability of resources may make certain items harder to follow, for example antibiotic prophylaxis and pulse oximeter use. Efforts should, and are, being made to make these important products more widely available. In the meantime, the Checklist should be used as completely as possible in all settings where surgery is carried out."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What is the key to successful implementation of the Checklist?", "answer": "Our understanding of what makes implementation of it successful is growing as worldwide experience increases. A few key factors have been identified, which include: Local clinical champions of the Checklist who are influential in their hospital are very important in explaining and demonstrating the benefits of correct use of the Checklist. Staff need to be fully engaged in bringing about local modifications to the Checklist and the implementation process. Workshops and wider safety education alongside use of the Checklist are helpful. Senior hospital leaders need to be seen to be committed to implementing the Checklist. It must be recognized that successful implementation of the Checklist does take time."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How can I successfully implement the Checklist in my hospital?", "answer": "There are a number of resources on the WHO website to help you start using the Checklist in your hospital. These include the guidelines for safe surgery, pre-prepared presentations and briefings for colleagues, help with questions you are likely to be asked and a step-by-step guide to its practical implementation."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Our surgical teams don’t want to use the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist unless they can change a few of the elements. Is it okay to make changes to the Checklist?", "answer": "Yes, the Checklist was not intended to be comprehensive, and we encourage modiﬁcations for local use. We understand that the Checklist, while intended to be universally applicable, is not always a perfect ﬁt for all institutions. Modiﬁcations can be made to include items that are deemed essential in your specific setting. There are a number of resources on the WHO website to help you start using the Checklist in your hospital. These include the guidelines for safe surgery, pre-prepared presentations and briefings for colleagues, help with questions you are likely to be asked and a step-by-step guide to its practical implementation. However, there are two things to be aware of: Be very cautious about removing items from the Checklist. All the steps included are there because there is strong evidence that they can prevent serious harm. If you are having difficulty completing a particular item, it is better to work to find solutions to this problem than to simply remove that item. Avoid making the Checklist too comprehensive. The more items added to it, the more difﬁcult it will become to implement successfully. Please refer to the Checklist Adaptation Guide before making any changes, for recommendations on modifying the Checklist."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "My hospital is quite large, with many operating rooms. How can I implement a checklist in this environment?", "answer": "The key to successful implementation is to start small. Start with a single operating room on one day and see how it works. This will guide you to strategies for modifying the Checklist to ﬁt your needs, as well as identify potential barriers to its successful adaptation."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Who should be in charge of running the Checklist?", "answer": "Although every member of the operating team – surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses, technicians and other operating room personnel – is involved in its execution, a single person should be responsible for leading the discussion of all components of the Checklist. This is essential for its success. This will often be a circulating nurse, but it can be any clinician or health-care professional participating in the operation. This individual should prevent the team from progressing to the next phase of the operation until each step has been satisfactorily addressed."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "My hospital is very busy. Won’t the Checklist just waste time and make our operating theatres less efficient?", "answer": "Running through the Checklist fully takes only a few minutes each time and a study has found no reduction in the number of cases performed when the Checklist is in use. In certain emergency situations using the Checklist might be difficult due to the urgency of the case but these instances will be rare. Using the Checklist can make processes work more smoothly, as it improves communication between team members. When the cost and inefficiency of surgical complications is taken into account, using the Checklist is likely to make a surgical department more efficient."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "My team often stays together for the whole day. Must we introduce ourselves before every surgery?", "answer": "The most critical time for introductions is at the beginning of an operative day. There is no need to repeat introductions if they have already been made. However, if new members join a room, they should introduce themselves as should every member of the team present. Even if everyone knows each other, introductions are important as they serve to reinforce team communication. An important part of the introductions is to enable every member of the team to speak aloud when they introduce themselves. There is evidence that once an individual has spoken aloud once they will be more likely to speak up again if they have concerns later. This is particularly important for junior team members."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "Should we memorize the Checklist?", "answer": "No. Checklists are created to avoid the pitfalls of memorization and omissions that occur when standardized processes are not clearly written and deﬁned. Reading from the Checklist for every case will help ensure that teams consistently follow critical safety steps and thereby minimize the most common avoidable risks endangering the lives and well-being of surgical patients."}
{"topic": "/safe-surgery-saves-lives-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "While there is enthusiasm amongst some clinicians for the Checklist, there are others who do not see the value of this initiative. Can we still use the Checklist?", "answer": "Yes. Implementation should always begin with the most enthusiastic. The Checklist can be implemented by an individual clinician in cases in which he or she participates, a selected service or operating room suite at a hospital, before progressing to hospital-wide or even system-wide use of the Checklist. Focus energy on those areas and individuals who are receptive to the idea at ﬁrst, and as they become accustomed to the Checklist and its beneﬁts, they will help spread the word to their peers. Collecting local data on compliance with Checklist items and on outcomes from surgery can be a very powerful motivating tool. This need not be of publishable quality, but it is important to start data collection early and ensure it is accurate."}

{"topic": "/simple-rapid-tests", "question": "What is a Simple/Rapid test?", "answer": "Simple/Rapid tests are designed for use where a preliminary screening test result is required and are especially useful in resource-limited countries High quality, easy-to-use tests for use in resource poor settings. Tests based on agglutination, immuno-dot, immuno-chromatographic and/or immuno-filtration techniques. Quick and easy to perform – 10 minutes to 2 hours – and require little or no additional equipment. Are designed for use with individual or a limited number of samples, which make them more economical then ELISAs in low throughput laboratories. Possibility to store at room temperature for extended period of time. Same-day results provide timely treatment interventions."}
{"topic": "/simple-rapid-tests", "question": "What is the difference between a ELISA and a Simple/Rapid test", "answer": "ELISAs are highly sensitive and specific, and are able to detect HIV-1/ HIV-2 and variants. They require sophisticated equipment that must be regularly maintained, a constant electricity supply and skilled technicians. They are really not suitable for small laboratories, but for testing large numbers of samples per day, as well as in blood banks or for surveillance studies. The Simple/Rapid tests are better for emergency testing, and in smaller laboratories with low numbers of tests per day."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Know the IHR; purpose, scope, principles and concepts", "answer": "The International Health Regulations (2005) (hereinafter \"the IHR\" or “the Regulations”) are an international agreement that is legally binding on 194 countries (States Parties), including all WHO Member States. The IHR define their \"purpose and scope\" as: \"to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade\". Since their entry into force on 15 June 2007, the IHR directs and governs particular WHO and States Parties activities aiming that protect the global community from public health risks and emergencies that cross international borders. These activities are implemented in ways that are consistent with other international law and agreements; their implementation must \"be with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedom of persons\" and \"guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease\". The scope of the IHR is purposely broad and inclusive in respect of the public health event to which they have application in order to maximize the probability that all such events that could have serious international consequences are identified early and promptly reported by States Parties to WHO for assessment. The Regulations aim to provide a legal frame work for the prevention, detection and containment of public health risks at source, before they spread across borders, through the collaborative actions of States Parties and WHO. Notification is required under IHR for all \"events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern\". In this regard, the broad new definitions of \"event\", \"disease\" and \"public health risk\" in the IHR are the building blocks of the surveillance obligations for States Parties and WHO. \"Disease\" means \"an illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source, that presents or could present significant harm to humans\". The term \"event\" is broadly defined as \"a manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease\". \"Public health risk\" refers to \"a likelihood of an event that may affect adversely the health of human populations, with an emphasis on one which may spread internationally or may present a serious and direct danger\". A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is defined as \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\". Consequently, events of potential international concern, which require States Parties to notify WHO, can extend beyond communicable diseases and arise from any origin or source. The IHR explicitly allow WHO to take into account information from sources other than official notifications and consultations, and, after assessment, to seek verification of specific events from the concerned States Parties. Notification to WHO marks the beginning of an exclusive dialogue between the notifying State Party and WHO on further event assessment, potential investigation and any appropriate local or global public health response. The responsibility for implementing the IHR rests jointly with States Parties and WHO. In order to be able to notify events, or respond to public health risks and emergencies, States Parties must have the capacity to detect such events through a well established national surveillance and response infrastructure. States Parties are required to collaborate actively with each other, together with WHO, to mobilize the financial resources to facilitate the implementation of their obligations under the IHR. Upon request, WHO assists developing countries in mobilizing financial resources and provides technical support to build, strengthen and maintain the capacities set out in Annex 1 of the Regulations."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Update national legislation", "answer": "An adequate legal framework to support and enable all of the varied IHR State Party activities is needed in each country. In some countries, giving effect to the IHR within domestic jurisdiction and national law requires that the relevant authorities adopt implementing legislation for some or all of the relevant rights and obligations for States Parties. However, even where new or revised legislation may not be explicitly required under a country's legal system for implementation of one or more provisions in the IHR, revision of some legislation, regulations or other instruments may still be considered by the country in order to facilitate performance of IHR activities in a more efficient, effective or otherwise beneficial manner. Additionally, from a policy perspective, implementing legislation may serve to institutionalize and strengthen the role of IHR capacities and operations within the State Party, as well as the ability to exercise certain rights contained in the Regulations. A further potential benefit from such legislation is that it can facilitate necessary coordination among the different entities involved in implementation and help to ensure continuity. For these reasons, States Parties to the IHR should consider assessing their relevant existing legislation to determine whether they may be appropriate for revision in order to facilitate full and efficient implementation of the Regulations."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Recognize shared realities and the need for collective defences", "answer": "The recognition that globalisation brings with it new challenges and opportunities for preventing the international spread of disease was the starting point for the revision of the International Health Regulations (1969) or \"IHR (1969)\". In 2003, the outbreak and eventual control of SARS convinced the world's governments of the necessity for a collective and coordinated defence against emerging public health threats, providing the impetus needed to complete the revision process. The IHR were adopted by the Health Assembly on 23 May 2005, and entered into force on 15 June 2007. The IHR legal framework supports existing and innovative approaches in the global detection of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. The current Regulations were built in part on the foundations of their predecessor, the IHR (1969), and were primarily based on the experiences of WHO and its Member States in national surveillance systems, epidemic intelligence, verification, risk assessment, outbreak alert, and coordination of international response, all of which are part of WHO’s decade-long work to enhance global public health security. In contrast to the IHR (1969), the current Regulations have a broad scope, provide for the use of a wide range of information and emphasize collaborative actions between States Parties and WHO in the identification and assessment of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. In WHO's coordination of the international response to public health emergencies of international concern, maximum measures are replaced by formally recommended and context-specific temporary health measures, tailored to the actual threat faced."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Monitor and report on IHR implementation progress", "answer": "States Parties and WHO alike are required to report to the World Health Assembly on IHR implementation. To date, this requirement has been fulfilled through annual reporting by the WHO Secretariat to its governing bodies. Using information gathered through questionnaires, the WHO Secretariat has summarized the activities carried by countries to implement the IHR. It is anticipated that, in the future, this data will be collected using specific indicators currently under development. In addition to this, the IHR Coordination Department collaborates closely with WHO Regional Offices and other relevant departments and programmes to report on WHO’s work in support of IHR implementation."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Notify, report, consult and inform WHO", "answer": "The IHR describe key elements of the procedures to be followed by States Parties and WHO in terms of information sharing with regard to notified events. Official event-related communications under the IHR are carried out between the National IHR Focal Point and their corresponding regional WHO IHR Contact Point, both of whom are officially designated and required to be available on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week. The IHR (2005) specify three ways in which States Parties can initiate event-related communications with WHO: Notification – Under the IHR, States Parties are required to notify WHO of all events that are assessed as possibly constituting a PHEIC, taking into account the context in which an event occurs. These notifications must occur within 24 hours of assessment by the country using the decision instrument provided in Annex 2 of the Regulations. This decision instrument identifies four criteria that States Parties must follow in their assessment of events within their territories and their decision as to whether an event is notifiable to WHO: Is the public health impact of the event serious? Is the event unusual or unexpected? Is there a significant risk of international spread? Is there a significant risk of international restriction(s) to travel and trade? Notifications must be followed by ongoing communication of detailed public health information on the event, including, where possible, case definition, laboratory results, source and type of the risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease and the health measures employed. Consultation - In cases where the State Party is unable to complete a definitive assessment with the decision instrument in Annex 2, State Parties have an explicit option of initiating confidential consultations with WHO and seeking advice on evaluation, assessment and appropriate health measures to be taken. Other Reports - State Parties must inform WHO through the National IHR Focal Point within 24 hours of receipt of evidence of a public health risk identified outside their territory that may cause international disease spread, as manifested by imported or exported human cases, vectors which carry infection or contamination, or by contaminated goods. In addition to these three types of communications, States Parties are required under the IHR to respond to WHO Requests for Verification . WHO has an express mandate to obtain verification from States Parties concerning unofficial reports or communications, received from various sources, about events arising within their territories which may constitute a PHEIC; these reports are initially reviewed by WHO prior to the issuing of a verification request. States Parties must acknowledge verification requests by WHO within 24 hours and provide public health information on the status of the event, followed, in a timely manner, by continued communication of accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to the notifying State Party."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Understand WHO’s role in international event detection, joint assessment and response", "answer": "The IHR underpin WHO’s mandate to manage the international response to acute public health events and risks, including public health emergencies of international concern. The Regulations also recognize WHO's general surveillance obligations, and set out specific procedures for concerned States Parties and WHO to collaborate in the assessment and control of public health events and risks, even before such events have been officially notified to WHO. At the international level, WHO’s real-time analysis of public health events uses technical knowledge, an understanding of the situational and operational context, and risk communication requirements to assess public health risks in accordance with WHO’s mandate under the IHR. To further strengthen international alert and response capabilities, an enhanced event-management system and standard operating procedures have been developed by WHO. This web-based tool functions as the official repository of all information relevant to an event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. It facilitates communications within WHO, with National IHR Focal Points, with technical institutions and partners, and provides timely public health information for the management of these events and risks. Information relating to public health risks notified or reported under the IHR (2005) to WHO is jointly assessed with the affected State Party to ascertain the nature and extent of the risk, the potential for international disease spread and interference with travel and trade, and appropriate response and containment strategies. In order to meet its IHR obligations and to facilitate information sharing between the Organization and States Parties to the Regulations, WHO has established an IHR Event Information Site. This site is accessible to National IHR Focal Points and provides up-to-date information on ongoing public health events of international concern."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Participate in the PHEIC determination and WHO recommendations-making processes", "answer": "PHEIC determinations and the issuing of corresponding WHO recommendations by the Director-General will be a rare occurrence. Indeed, since the entry into force of the IHR on 15 June 2007 only one such determination has been made and recommendations issued. It is important that States Parties to the IHR are aware of the processes that may affect them and of their right to be consulted and present their views. If immediate global action is needed to provide a public health response to prevent or control the international spread of disease, the IHR give the Director-General of WHO the authority to determine that the event constitutes a PHEIC. On such occasions, an IHR Emergency Committee provides its views to the Director-General on temporary recommendations on the most appropriate and necessary public health measures to respond to the emergency. A State Party affected by a potential emergency needs to work closely with WHO to ensure that all relevant information and considerations are brought to bear prior such a determination and the adoption of any corresponding temporary recommendations. However, the right of a State to be consulted or prevent its views to an Emergency Committee shall be without prejudice to the need to act swiftly in the event of an emergency. In cases where the State Party concerned may not agree that a PHEIC is occurring, the Emergency Committee will also provide advice. The temporary recommendations issued by the Director-General are for affected and non-affected States Parties in order to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Strengthen national surveillance and response capacities", "answer": "Another fundamental aspect of the IHR is the obligation for all States Parties to develop, strengthen and maintain core public health capacities for surveillance and response. In order to be able to detect, assess, notify and report events and respond to public health risks and emergencies of international concern, States Parties must meet the requirements described in Annex 1A of the IHR (2005). Annex 1A outlines these core capacities at the local (community), intermediate and national levels, including, at the national level, the assessment of all reports of urgent events within 48 hours and the immediate reporting to WHO through the National IHR Focal Point, when required. The IHR require each State Party, with the support of WHO, to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements \"as soon as possible\", but not later than five years after the date of entry into force for that country. The IHR set out a two-phase process to assist States Parties to plan for the implementation of their public health capacity obligations. In the first phase, from 15 June 2007 to 15 June 2009, States Parties must assess the ability of their existing national structures and resources to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements. This assessment must lead to the development and implementation of national plans of action. As specified in the IHR, WHO must support these assessments and provide guidance on the national planning and implementation of these capacity strengthening plans. In the second phase from 15 June 2009 to 15 June 2012, the national action plans are expected to be implemented by each State Party to ensure that core capacities are present and functioning throughout the country and/or its relevant territories. States Parties that experience difficulties in implementing their plans may request an additional two year period until 15 June 2014 to meet their Annex 1A obligations. On the basis of a justified need, an extension of two years may be obtained. In exceptional circumstances, and supported by a new implementation plan, the Director-General of WHO may grant an individual State Party a further extension not exceeding two years to meet its obligations."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Increase public health security at ports airports and ground crossings", "answer": "International points of entry, whether by land, sea or air, provide an opportunity to apply health measures to prevent international spread of disease. For this reason, many of the provisions addressing this aspect in the IHR (1969) have been updated in the IHR (2005). A number of new provisions have been included. When applying IHR-related health measures to international travellers, for example, it is required that they be treated with courtesy and respect, taking into consideration their gender, sociocultural, ethnic and religious concerns. They must be supplied with appropriate food, water, accommodation and medical treatment if quarantined, isolated or otherwise subject to medical or public health measures under the IHR (2005). States Parties are required to designate the international airports and ports and any ground crossings which will develop specific capacities in the application of the public health measures required to manage a variety of public health risks. These capacities include access to appropriate medical services (with diagnostic facilities), services for the transport of ill persons, trained personnel to inspect ships, aircraft and other conveyances, maintenance of a healthy environment as well as ensuring plans and facilities to apply emergency measures such as quarantine."}
{"topic": "/emergencies-ten-things-you-need-to-do-to-implement-the-international-health-regulations", "question": "Use and disseminate IHR health documents at points of entry", "answer": "The IHR require the implementation of a range of health documents at ports, airports and ground crossings. Failure by States Parties to use and include these documents in their daily operations may result in unnecessary disruption to international traffic. Model Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/Ship Sanitation Control Certificate The Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/Ship Sanitation Control Certificate replaced the narrower in scope Deratting/Deratting Exemption Certificate on 15 June 2007. Model Maritime Declaration of Health The Maritime Declaration of Health reflects the broader scope of the IHR and currently accepted technical standards and terminology. Model International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis replaces the International Certificate of Vaccination or Revaccination against Yellow Fever Yellow fever is the only disease specifically designated under the IHR for which proof of vaccination or prophylaxis may be required for travellers as a condition of entry to a State. The “International certificate of vaccination or revaccination against yellow fever” was replaced by the “International certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis” (ICVP). Clinicians issuing the certificate should note that the main difference from the old certificate is that they have to specify in writing in the space provided that the disease for which the certificate is issued is “yellow fever”. The ICVP does not contain a references to a designated vaccination centre. Health Part of the Aircraft General Declaration This is a document of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency. The document is periodically reviewed by ICAO Member States, and has historically, for practical purposes, been reproduced in the annexes of the IHR.

{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What are genetically modified (GM) organisms and GM foods?", "answer": "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species. Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Why are GM foods produced?", "answer": "GM foods are developed – and marketed – because there is some perceived advantage either to the producer or consumer of these foods. This is meant to translate into a product with a lower price, greater benefit (in terms of durability or nutritional value) or both. Initially GM seed developers wanted their products to be accepted by producers and have concentrated on innovations that bring direct benefit to farmers (and the food industry generally). One of the objectives for developing plants based on GM organisms is to improve crop protection. The GM crops currently on the market are mainly aimed at an increased level of crop protection through the introduction of resistance against plant diseases caused by insects or viruses or through increased tolerance towards herbicides. Resistance against insects is achieved by incorporating into the food plant the gene for toxin production from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This toxin is currently used as a conventional insecticide in agriculture and is safe for human consumption. GM crops that inherently produce this toxin have been shown to require lower quantities of insecticides in specific situations, e.g. where pest pressure is high. Virus resistance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from certain viruses which cause disease in plants. Virus resistance makes plants less susceptible to diseases caused by such viruses, resulting in higher crop yields. Herbicide tolerance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium conveying resistance to some herbicides. In situations where weed pressure is high, the use of such crops has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the herbicides used."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Is the safety of GM foods assessed differently from conventional foods?", "answer": "Generally consumers consider that conventional foods (that have an established record of safe consumption over the history) are safe. Whenever novel varieties of organisms for food use are developed using the traditional breeding methods that had existed before the introduction of gene technology, some of the characteristics of organisms may be altered, either in a positive or a negative way. National food authorities may be called upon to examine the safety of such conventional foods obtained from novel varieties of organisms, but this is not always the case. In contrast, most national authorities consider that specific assessments are necessary for GM foods. Specific systems have been set up for the rigorous evaluation of GM organisms and GM foods relative to both human health and the environment. Similar evaluations are generally not performed for conventional foods. Hence there currently exists a significant difference in the evaluation process prior to marketing for these two groups of food. The WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses aims at assisting national authorities in the identification of foods that should be subject to risk assessment and to recommend appropriate approaches to safety assessment. Should national authorities decide to conduct safety assessment of GM organisms, WHO recommends the use of Codex Alimentarius guidelines (See the answer to Question 11 below)."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "How is a safety assessment of GM food conducted?", "answer": "The safety assessment of GM foods generally focuses on: (a) direct health effects (toxicity), (b) potential to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity); (c) specific components thought to have nutritional or toxic properties; (d) the stability of the inserted gene; (e) nutritional effects associated with genetic modification; and (f) any unintended effects which could result from the gene insertion."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What are the main issues of concern for human health?", "answer": "While theoretical discussions have covered a broad range of aspects, the three main issues debated are the potentials to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity), gene transfer and outcrossing. Allergenicity As a matter of principle, the transfer of genes from commonly allergenic organisms to non-allergic organisms is discouraged unless it can be demonstrated that the protein product of the transferred gene is not allergenic. While foods developed using traditional breeding methods are not generally tested for allergenicity, protocols for the testing of GM foods have been evaluated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO. No allergic effects have been found relative to GM foods currently on the market. Gene transfer Gene transfer from GM foods to cells of the body or to bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract would cause concern if the transferred genetic material adversely affects human health. This would be particularly relevant if antibiotic resistance genes, used as markers when creating GMOs, were to be transferred. Although the probability of transfer is low, the use of gene transfer technology that does not involve antibiotic resistance genes is encouraged. Outcrossing The migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or related species in the wild (referred to as “outcrossing”), as well as the mixing of crops derived from conventional seeds with GM crops, may have an indirect effect on food safety and food security. Cases have been reported where GM crops approved for animal feed or industrial use were detected at low levels in the products intended for human consumption. Several countries have adopted strategies to reduce mixing, including a clear separation of the fields within which GM crops and conventional crops are grown."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "How is a risk assessment for the environment performed?", "answer": "Environmental risk assessments cover both the GMO concerned and the potential receiving environment. The assessment process includes evaluation of the characteristics of the GMO and its effect and stability in the environment, combined with ecological characteristics of the environment in which the introduction will take place. The assessment also includes unintended effects which could result from the insertion of the new gene."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What are the issues of concern for the environment?", "answer": "Issues of concern include: the capability of the GMO to escape and potentially introduce the engineered genes into wild populations; the persistence of the gene after the GMO has been harvested; the susceptibility of non-target organisms (e.g. insects which are not pests) to the gene product; the stability of the gene; the reduction in the spectrum of other plants including loss of biodiversity; and increased use of chemicals in agriculture. The environmental safety aspects of GM crops vary considerably according to local conditions."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Are GM foods safe?", "answer": "Different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways. This means that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods. GM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved. Continuous application of safety assessments based on the Codex Alimentarius principles and, where appropriate, adequate post market monitoring, should form the basis for ensuring the safety of GM foods."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "How are GM foods regulated nationally?", "answer": "The way governments have regulated GM foods varies. In some countries GM foods are not yet regulated. Countries which have legislation in place focus primarily on assessment of risks for consumer health. Countries which have regulatory provisions for GM foods usually also regulate GMOs in general, taking into account health and environmental risks, as well as control- and trade-related issues (such as potential testing and labelling regimes). In view of the dynamics of the debate on GM foods, legislation is likely to continue to evolve."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What kind of GM foods are on the market internationally?", "answer": "GM crops available on the international market today have been designed using one of three basic traits: resistance to insect damage; resistance to viral infections; and tolerance towards certain herbicides. GM crops with higher nutrient content (e.g. soybeans increased oleic acid) have been also studied recently."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What happens when GM foods are traded internationally?", "answer": "The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) is the joint FAO/WHO intergovernmental body responsible for developing the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex Alimentarius, meaning the international food code. Codex developed principles for the human health risk analysis of GM foods in 2003. Principles for the risk analysis of foods derived from modern biotechnology The premise of these principles sets out a premarket assessment, performed on a caseby- case basis and including an evaluation of both direct effects (from the inserted gene) and unintended effects (that may arise as a consequence of insertion of the new gene) Codex also developed three Guidelines: Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA plants Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods produced using recombinant-DNA microorganisms Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA animals Codex principles do not have a binding effect on national legislation, but are referred to specifically in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization (SPS Agreement), and WTO Members are encouraged to harmonize national standards with Codex standards. If trading partners have the same or similar mechanisms for the safety assessment of GM foods, the possibility that one product is approved in one country but rejected in another becomes smaller. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an environmental treaty legally binding for its Parties which took effect in 2003, regulates transboundary movements of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). GM foods are within the scope of the Protocol only if they contain LMOs that are capable of transferring or replicating genetic material. The cornerstone of the Protocol is a requirement that exporters seek consent from importers before the first shipment of LMOs intended for release into the environment."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Have GM products on the international market passed a safety assessment?", "answer": "The GM products that are currently on the international market have all passed safety assessments conducted by national authorities. These different assessments in general follow the same basic principles, including an assessment of environmental and human health risk. The food safety assessment is usually based on Codex documents."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Why has there been concern about GM foods among some politicians, public interest groups and consumers?", "answer": "Since the first introduction on the market in the mid-1990s of a major GM food (herbicide-resistant soybeans), there has been concern about such food among politicians, activists and consumers, especially in Europe. Several factors are involved. In the late 1980s – early 1990s, the results of decades of molecular research reached the public domain. Until that time, consumers were generally not very aware of the potential of this research. In the case of food, consumers started to wonder about safety because they perceive that modern biotechnology is leading to the creation of new species. Consumers frequently ask, “what is in it for me?”. Where medicines are concerned, many consumers more readily accept biotechnology as beneficial for their health (e.g. vaccines, medicines with improved treatment potential or increased safety). In the case of the first GM foods introduced onto the European market, the products were of no apparent direct benefit to consumers (not significantly cheaper, no increased shelflife, no better taste). The potential for GM seeds to result in bigger yields per cultivated area should lead to lower prices. However, public attention has focused on the risk side of the risk-benefit equation, often without distinguishing between potential environmental impacts and public health effects of GMOs. Consumer confidence in the safety of food supplies in Europe has decreased significantly as a result of a number of food scares that took place in the second half of the 1990s that are unrelated to GM foods. This has also had an impact on discussions about the acceptability of GM foods. Consumers have questioned the validity of risk assessments, both with regard to consumer health and environmental risks, focusing in particular on long-term effects. Other topics debated by consumer organizations have included allergenicity and antimicrobial resistance. Consumer concerns have triggered a discussion on the desirability of labelling GM foods, allowing for an informed choice of consumers."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What is the state of public debate on GMOs?", "answer": "The release of GMOs into the environment and the marketing of GM foods have resulted in a public debate in many parts of the world. This debate is likely to continue, probably in the broader context of other uses of biotechnology (e.g. in human medicine) and their consequences for human societies. Even though the issues under debate are usually very similar (costs and benefits, safety issues), the outcome of the debate differs from country to country. On issues such as labelling and traceability of GM foods as a way to address consumer preferences, there is no worldwide consensus to date. Despite the lack of consensus on these topics, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has made significant progress and developed Codex texts relevant to labelling of foods derived from modern biotechnology in 2011 to ensure consistency on any approach on labelling implemented by Codex members with already adopted Codex provisions."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Are people’s reactions related to the different attitudes to food in various regions of the world?", "answer": "Depending on the region of the world, people often have different attitudes to food. In addition to nutritional value, food often has societal and historical connotations, and in some instances may have religious importance. Technological modification of food and food production may evoke a negative response among consumers, especially in the absence of sound risk communication on risk assessment efforts and cost/benefit evaluations."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Are there implications for the rights of farmers to own their crops?", "answer": "Yes, intellectual property rights are likely to be an element in the debate on GM foods, with an impact on the rights of farmers. In the FAO/WHO expert consultation in 2003, WHO and FAO have considered potential problems of the technological divide and the unbalanced distribution of benefits and risks between developed and developing countries and the problem often becomes even more acute through the existence of intellectual property rights and patenting that places an advantage on the strongholds of scientific and technological expertise. Such considerations are likely to also affect the debate on GM foods."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "Why are certain groups concerned about the growing influence of the chemical industry on agriculture?", "answer": "Certain groups are concerned about what they consider to be an undesirable level of control of seed markets by a few chemical companies. Sustainable agriculture and biodiversity benefit most from the use of a rich variety of crops, both in terms of good crop protection practices as well as from the perspective of society at large and the values attached to food. These groups fear that as a result of the interest of the chemical industry in seed markets, the range of varieties used by farmers may be reduced mainly to GM crops. This would impact on the food basket of a society as well as in the long run on crop protection (for example, with the development of resistance against insect pests and tolerance of certain herbicides). The exclusive use of herbicide-tolerant GM crops would also make the farmer dependent on these chemicals. These groups fear a dominant position of the chemical industry in agricultural development, a trend which they do not consider to be sustainable."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What further developments can be expected in the area of GMOs?", "answer": "Future GM organisms are likely to include plants with improved resistance against plant disease or drought, crops with increased nutrient levels, fish species with enhanced growth characteristics. For non-food use, they may include plants or animals producing pharmaceutically important proteins such as new vaccines."}
{"topic": "/food-genetically-modified", "question": "What has WHO been doing to improve the evaluation of GM foods?", "answer": "WHO has been taking an active role in relation to GM foods, primarily for two reasons: on the grounds that public health could benefit from the potential of biotechnology, for example, from an increase in the nutrient content of foods, decreased allergenicity and more efficient and/or sustainable food production; and based on the need to examine the potential negative effects on human health of the consumption of food produced through genetic modification in order to protect public health. Modern technologies should be thoroughly evaluated if they are to constitute a true improvement in the way food is produced. WHO, together with FAO, has convened several expert consultations on the evaluation of GM foods and provided technical advice for the Codex Alimentarius Commission which was fed into the Codex Guidelines on safety assessment of GM foods. WHO will keep paying due attention to the safety of GM foods from the view of public health protection, in close collaboration with FAO and other international bodies."}
{"topic": "/headache-disorders-how-common-are-headaches", "question": "How common are headaches?", "answer": "Headaches are extremely common. Nearly everyone has a headache \noccasionally.

{"topic": "/who-choice-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "How do you determine the “Costs” and “Effects”?", "answer": "The impact on the population of interest when it is given a certain technology gives the estimate\r\nof effectiveness, which is applied to a population level model to project the likely impact in health\r\nadjusted life expectancy over the next 100 years. For cost, the costs of administration, training, and\r\nprogramme elements are added to the cost of operations as determined from best practice\r\nguidelines."}
{"topic": "/who-choice-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "My disease/risk factor of interest is not included in the CHOICE results. Can it be added?", "answer": "WHO-CHOICE uses a generic set of tools which can be applied to any health condition. The\r\nCHOICE team would be happy to discuss the addition of additional diseases to our knowledge base.\r\nPlease contact the team to discuss."}
{"topic": "/who-choice-frequently-asked-questions", "question": "What are some examples of one of the more significant results of WHO CHOICE so far?", "answer": "In 2021, we present for the first-time a cross-programme analysis of the comparative cost-effectiveness of 479 intervention scenarios across 20 disease programmes and risk factors. This analysis follows the standard WHO-CHOICE approach to generalized cost-effectiveness analysis applied to two regions, Eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. The scope of the analysis is all interventions included in programme specific WHO-CHOICE analyses, using WHO treatment guidelines for major disease areas as the foundation. Costs are measured in 2010 international dollars, and benefits modelled beginning in 2010, or the nearest year for which validated data was available, both for a period of 100 years. We observe that, across both regions included in the analysis, interventions span multiple orders of magnitude in terms of cost-effectiveness ratios. A health benefit package optimized through a value for money lens incorporates interventions responding to all the main drivers of disease burden. Interventions delivered through first level clinical and nonclinical services represent most of the high impact cost-effective interventions. Therefore, in conclusion cost-effectiveness is one important criterion when selecting health interventions for benefit packages to progress towards universal health coverage (UHC), but it is not the only criterion, and all calculations should be adapted to the local context."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What does universal health coverage mean?", "answer": "Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need (prevention, promotion, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care) without the risk of financial hardship when paying for them. This requires an efficient health system that provides the entire population with access to good quality services, health workers, medicines and technologies. It also requires a financing system to protect people from financial hardship and impoverishment from health care costs. Access to health services ensures healthier people; while financial risk protection prevents people from being pushed into poverty. Therefore, universal health coverage is a critical component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key element to reducing social inequities. Universal health coverage is not something that can be achieved overnight, but all countries can take action to move more rapidly towards it, or to maintain the gains they have already made."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is needed to achieve it?", "answer": "For a community or country to achieve universal health coverage, several factors must be in place including: A strong, efficient, well-run health system that meets priority health needs through people-centred integrated care by: informing and encouraging people to stay healthy and prevent illness; detecting health conditions early; having the capacity to treat disease; and helping patients with rehabilitation ensuring sensitive palliative care where needed. Affordability – a system for financing health services so people do not suffer financial hardship when using them. Availability of essential medicines and technologies to diagnose and treat medical problems. A sufficient capacity of well-trained, motivated health workers to provide the services to meet patients’ needs based on the best available evidence. Actions to address social determinants of health such as education, living conditions and household income which affect people’s health and their access to services."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What services should be included in universal health coverage?", "answer": "Essential health services (including for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, non-communicable diseases and mental health, sexual and reproductive health and child health) should be available to all who need them. The dilemma for most countries, in particular low-income countries, is that they are not able to provide everyone with all the health services they need at an affordable price, even with the large increases in external donor assistance for health since 2000. The goal should be to provide an increasing number of health services over time while at the same time reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients. Decisions about the services that can be guaranteed to the population initially, and which ones should be added over time, are based on peoples’ needs, public opinion and costs. The priority should be to ensure access to the key interventions targeting the health Millennium Development Goals – births attended by a trained health worker, family planning, vaccinations, and prevention and treatment of diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis – while considering how to address the growing problem of noncommunicable diseases."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "How this can be financed?", "answer": "Universal health coverage is fundamental to ensuring social protection for health. The poorest populations often face the highest health risks and need more health services. A key element of financing for universal health coverage is sharing resources to spread the financial risks of ill-health across the population. The system should collect large pools of prepaid funds that can be used to cover the health care costs of those in need, regardless of their ability to pay. The countries that have made the most progress on providing universal health coverage have implemented mandatory contributions for people who can afford to pay through taxation, and/or compulsory earmarked contributions for health insurance. Reducing the reliance on direct, out-of-pocket payments lowers the financial barriers to access and reduces the impoverishing impact of health payments."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "Are the most vulnerable people covered?", "answer": "In terms of financial protection, the most vulnerable people should have access to the health services they need without restrictions. In all countries, it has been found that governments have to use general budget revenues to meet the health costs (and/or insurance premiums) of poor and vulnerable people. Ensuring access to health facilities, workers and medicines in remote, rural areas is also important, as is providing special interventions for stigmatized populations. Universal coverage is firmly based on the WHO Constitution of 1948 declaring health a fundamental human right and on the Health for All agenda set by the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978. Equity is paramount. This means that countries need to track progress in providing access not just across the national population but within different groups (e.g. by income level, sex, age, place of residence, migrant status and ethnic origin)"}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "Isn't it too ambitious? Are countries succeeding in implementing?", "answer": "Countries at all income levels can take steps to move closer to universal health coverage. Nepal, where free universal health care was introduced in 2008, is now on track to achieve its health-related MDGs. In 2008, the Afghan Government, using considerable donor funding, removed user fees in public health facilities and healthcare utilization more than doubled. Thailand has just celebrated ten years of its universal coverage scheme which has dramatically reduced impoverishment caused by out-of-pocket payments. More recently, El Salvador has launched an ambitious plan to expand health coverage including abolishing user fees and strengthening primary health care in remote and poor rural areas. Other countries moving forward in Africa include Liberia, Gabon, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Rwanda."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "How can we measure universal health coverage?", "answer": "As universal health coverage is a combination of whether people obtain the health services they need and financial risk protection, measurement needs to include both components. Coverage of health services can be measured by the percentage of people receiving the services they need: for example women in fertile age groups accessing modern methods of family planning or children immunized. On the other hand, financial risk protection can be evaluated by a reduction in the number of families pushed into poverty or placed under severe economic strain due to health costs. The impact of these steps on population health and household financial wellbeing can also be measured, as can many of the factors that make it easier to increase coverage. These include the availability of essential medicines, for example. The main challenge is that many countries do not have the capacity to measure coverage of all of the many health interventions that their populations needs. So they will need to choose a set of key indicators to track performance in service coverage. A sub-set of these could be used to compare performance between countries."}
{"topic": "/q-a-universal-health-coverage", "question": "What is the impact of universal health coverage on the population?", "answer": "Universal health coverage has a direct impact on a population’s health and welfare. Access and use of health services enables people to be more productive and active contributors to their families and communities. It also ensures that children can go to school and learn. At the same time, financial risk protection prevents people from being pushed into poverty when they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets. Universal health coverage is thus a critical component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key element of any effort to reduce social inequities. Universal coverage is the hallmark of a government’s commitment to improve the wellbeing of all its citizens."}
{"topic": "/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts", "question": "What are health inequities or inequalities?", "answer": "Health inequities are avoidable inequalities in health between groups of people within countries and between countries. These inequities arise from inequalities within and between societies. Social and economic conditions and their effects on people’s lives determine their risk of illness and the actions taken to prevent them becoming ill or treat illness when it occurs. Examples of health inequities between countries: the infant mortality rate (the risk of a baby dying between birth and one year of age) is 2 per 1000 live births in Iceland and over 120 per 1000 live births in Mozambique; the lifetime risk of maternal death during or shortly after pregnancy is only 1 in 17 400 in Sweden but it is 1 in 8 in Afghanistan. Examples of health inequities within countries: in Bolivia, babies born to women with no education have infant mortality greater than 100 per 1000 live births, while the infant mortality rate of babies born to mothers with at least secondary education is under 40 per 1000; life expectancy at birth among indigenous Australians is substantially lower (59.4 for males and 64.8 for females) than that of non-indigenous Australians (76.6 and 82.0, respectively); life expectancy at birth for men in the Calton neighbourhood of Glasgow is 54 years, 28 years less than that of men in Lenzie, a few kilometres away; the prevalence of long-term disabilities among European men aged 80+ years is 58.8% among the lower educated versus 40.2% among the higher educated."}
{"topic": "/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts", "question": "What is meant by social gradient?", "answer": "The poorest of the poor, around the world, have the worst health. Within countries, the evidence shows that in general the lower an individual’s socioeconomic position the worse their health. There is a social gradient in health that runs from top to bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum. This is a global phenomenon, seen in low, middle and high income countries. The social gradient in health means that health inequities affect everyone. For example, if you look at under-5 mortality rates by levels of household wealth you see that within counties the relation between socioeconomic level and health is graded. The poorest have the highest under-5 mortality rates, and people in the second highest quintile of household wealth have higher mortality in their offspring than those in the highest quintile. This is the social gradient in health."}
{"topic": "/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts", "question": "What are the social 'determinants' of health?", "answer": "The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances are in turn shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics."}
{"topic": "/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts", "question": "What are the drivers of health inequities?", "answer": "The global context affects how societies prosper through its impact on international relations and domestic norms and policies. These in turn shape the way society, both at national and local level, organizes its affairs, giving rise to forms of social position and hierarchy, whereby populations are organized according to income, education, occupation, gender, race/ethnicity and other factors. Where people are in the social hierarchy affects the conditions in which they grow, learn, live, work and age, their vulnerability to ill health and the consequences of ill health. The benefits of the economic growth that has taken place over the last 25 years are unequally distributed. In 1980 the richest countries, containing 10% of the world’s population, had gross national income 60 times that of the poorest countries, containing 10% of the world’s population. By 2005 this ratio had increased to 122. International flows of aid – grossly inadequate in themselves, and well below the levels promised – are dwarfed by the scale of many poor countries’ debt repayment obligations. The result is that, in many cases, there is a net financial outflow from poorer to richer countries – an alarming state of affairs. The trend over the last 15 years has been for the poorest quintile of the population in many countries to have a declining share in national consumption. In Kenya, for example, at current economic growth rates and with the present levels of income inequality, the median family in poverty would not cross the poverty line until 2030. Doubling the share of income growth enjoyed by Kenya’s poor would mean that reduction in poverty would happen by 2013. Gender biases in power, resources, entitlements, norms and values, and the way in which organizations are structured and programmes are run damage the health of millions of girls and women. The position of women in society is also associated with child health and survival – of boys and girls. Health equity depends vitally on the empowerment of individuals to challenge and change the unfair and steeply graded distribution of social resources to which everyone has equal claims and rights. Inequity in power interacts across four main dimensions – political, economic, social, and cultural – together constituting a continuum along which groups are, to varying degrees, excluded or included."}
{"topic": "/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts", "question": "What is primary health care?", "answer": "As stated at Alma Ata Conference: \"Primary health care is essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination.\" The WHO World Health Report of 2008 will further elaborate on this definition. World Health Report 2008"}
{"topic": "/social-determinants-of-health-key-concepts", "question": "What is health equity in all policies?", "answer": "Every aspect of government and the economy has the potential to affect health and health equity – finance, education, housing, employment, transport, and health, to name just six. While health may not be the main aim of policies in these sectors, they have strong bearing on health and health equity. Policy coherence is crucial – different government departments’ policies must complement rather than contradict each other in relation to health equity. For example, trade policy that actively encourages the production, trade, and consumption of foods high in fats and sugars to the detriment of fruit and vegetable production is contradictory to health policy Obesity is becoming a real public health challenge in transitioning countries, as it already is in high-income nations. Obesity prevention requires approaches that ensure a sustainable, adequate, and nutritious food supply; a habitat that lends itself to easy uptake of healthier food; participation in physical activity; and a family, educational, and work environment that positively reinforces healthy living. Very little of this action sits within the capabilities or responsibilities of the health sector. Positive advances have been made – for example, bans on advertisements for foods high in fats, sugars, and salt during television programmes aimed at children. However, a significant challenge remains: to engage with the multiple sectors outside health in areas such as trade, agriculture, employment, and education, if we are to redress the global obesity epidemic.

{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "What are the different modules in the tool?", "answer": "Health programmes and interventions: The user can choose to plan for intervention target setting by vertical programme or by service delivery level.\r\nIn both cases there is a process for detailed planning and for indicating which interventions should be\r\ndelivered at which delivery level, and with which resources. Should the user choose to configure planning parameters by vertical programme, the tool is opened with\r\ndefault assumptions available for 8 programmes that aim to capture interventions related to health MDGs:\r\nChild health; Reproductive and maternal health; Immunization; Nutrition; Water and Sanitation (WASH); HIV;\r\nTB; and Malaria. Additional programme components with default values will be added in 2013, including\r\nNCDs and mental health. The tool is flexible allowing the user to shift interventions between programmes, and also merge and/or\r\ncreate new programmes as needed depending on the national planning context. The following modules are included for health systems planning Human resources Infrastructure Logistics Health information systems Health finance Governance and leadership Importantly the OneHealth Tool includes a Financial Space module for projecting the expected financial\r\nenvelope under different country defined projections, as well as a Core Results module that brings together\r\nall the calculations into a set of summary results, identifying both quantities of inputs planned for, anticipated\r\ncosts, and likely health impact(s)."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "What formula algorithms are used?", "answer": "The tool uses an ingredients approach which multiplies Quantities by Prices. Prices and quantities are\r\nsometimes aggregated and presented to the user as unit costs. The tool allows for changes in quantities\r\nand prices over time (by year). The following algorithms are used in the tool for intervention costing: • Population in need of intervention = Population (demographic projection) x Proportion (%) of\r\npopulation identified as in need of the intervention (based on prevalence, incidence, or preventive\r\nproperties of the intervention) • Population receiving the intervention = Population in need of intervention x Coverage (%) \r\n2 • Intervention cost = Population receiving the intervention x Units of resources needed per case* x\r\nPrice per unit • Cost per delivery channel = Population receiving the intervention x Units needed per case* x Price\r\nper unit x Delivery Channel (%) *It should be noted that the units of resources needed per intervention and per case treated are specific to\r\nthe delivery level. In contrast, the unit prices for inputs are stored centrally within databases. One central\r\ndatabase of commodities links to all modules in order to ensure that all references to the same commodity\r\nwill utilise the same price. For health systems costing, similar algorithms are used. For example: Number of nurses = Number of nurses in previous year + recruitment – attrition (1) Salary cost for nurses per year = Number of nurses x average salary cost per year (2) Some modules within the tool apply more advanced approaches to support decision making – for example,\r\nthe Logistics module allows the user to make optimal planning decisions based on current supply chain\r\ncapacity and budget restrictions."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "To what extent are formulae visible to the user?", "answer": "The tool uses a Price x Quantity approach (PxQ), making the calculations easy to follow. However in the\r\ninterests of a user-friendly interface, formulas themselves are not visible in the software. The user can\r\nreview the formulas through information available in the accompanying technical documentation and\r\nprogramming source code is available upon request."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How is an increase in intervention coverage handled throughout the tool?", "answer": "Any planned increase in intervention coverage is communicated throughout the tool to all relevant modules.\r\nAt the level of intervention costing, any increase in population coverage is translated into a greater number\r\nof recipients of the intervention, and thus into greater quantities of drugs and commodities required, which is\r\nadjusted in the total budget for commodities within the plan. Furthermore there are direct links to the health system investment modules. For example the increase in\r\ncommodities is translated into specific requirements for the supply chain where the user can model logistics\r\nactivities to ensure that commodities are transported to where they are needed, thus impacting costs for\r\nlogistics. As another example there is a link built in whereby population coverage is translated into the\r\nestimated required number of health care visits at all levels, which is then further translated into an\r\nestimated number of full time equivalent health care workers that would be required to provide the care,\r\ngiven the skills specification and time required indicated per service provided. This estimate can be used as\r\na check within the human resources planning module, to compare the predicted output of health workers\r\nestimated needed, based on a bottom-up approach. Where necessary or by preference an option is also available for the user to manually enter increases in\r\nintervention coverage or through a menu of options."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "To what extent does the tool differentiate between costs at different service delivery levels of the system?", "answer": "The tool distinguishes between different service delivery levels including outreach, community, health centre\r\nand hospital level. The cost for providing the same service at different levels will be different, given costs for\r\ninfrastructure, human resources, equipment, etc. associated with each level. Moreover, the tool includes a\r\nfunction whereby the user can specify the commodities and human resource inputs needed for each \r\n3\r\nintervention, by delivery level. As an example, costs for maternal health services at hospital level may be\r\nrelatively high and the tool can be used to model different scenarios for shifting maternal health services to\r\nlower levels, thus informing policy discussions."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "To what extent does the tool take into account economies (or diseconomies) of scale?", "answer": "Economies of scale refer to decreases in average unit costs as the number of outputs increases. This\r\nphenomenon applies within the health sector where large fixed costs are spread across the number of\r\npatients using health services and higher coverage rates would spread costs over a greater number of\r\npeople. There may also be increasing average costs as coverage is extended to populations that are hard to\r\nreach, and where a higher per-patient investment in both fixed and variable costs may be needed in order to\r\nensure universal coverage of health care. OneHealth takes into account economies and diseconomies of scale implicitly, since quantities of inputs are\r\ndefined relative to the population covered. The user can enter assumptions for the programme activities\r\nneeded to extend services to hard-to-reach populations, including information campaigns, delivery of\r\nservices via outreach, and financial incentives to generate demand or encourage staff to work among\r\nmarginalized populations. In essence, OneHealth allows average costs to vary with scale, thus there may\r\nbe implicit economies of scale as output is increased. However the average cost (fixed and variable) would\r\nnot be a user input into the tool, rather it could be an output of the tool (for example the average\r\ninfrastructure cost per average outpatient visit).The tool does not output the average cost per person\r\nreached, but a user could calculate this based on total costs and the number of persons reached by\r\nintervention, if useful."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "To what extent does the tool deal with shared costs and potential double counting?", "answer": "Resources and costs are estimated at the input level to minimize double counting. Shared resources for\r\nhealth systems are estimated within the health systems modules and not in the programme-specific\r\nmodules, to ensure that resources are planned for by each cost centre. For example in the tool, facilities,\r\nlogistics, governance and human resources are systems costs only represented once, in the health systems\r\nmodules. Numerous links are built into the tool to enable the user to ensure that double counting is\r\nminimised. For example, the list of surveys planned for M&E by each health programme is summarised and\r\ncommunicated to the module for Health Information Systems (HIS) where they can be reviewed and\r\ndiscussed to inform the HIS plan. Mechanisms within the tool also exist for analysing activities that could be\r\nconsidered cross-cutting and for which integration could be strengthened, such as training programmes that\r\nestablished to deal with multiple conditions rather than single conditions."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How can countries find the cost information that they need to enter?", "answer": "The application of OneHealth to inform health sector wide planning by necessity requires substantial data\r\ninputs. This is in line with global efforts to help countries develop comprehensive M&E systems that\r\ngenerate data which can be linked to results and from the foundation of evidence-based planning and\r\nbudgeting. The approach used in OneHealth is ingredients based costing by which the user enters\r\ninformation on quantities and prices, rather than unit costs. Information on quantities and prices is often\r\nmore readily available at the country level than unit costs.\r\nWhere appropriate, OneHealth is also equipped with default values for both quantities and prices, with the\r\nformer are based on technical programme standards for service provision and health system strengthening.\r\nPrice defaults are made available from UN statistical databases, to the extent possible as country-specific \r\n4\r\nprices. Defaults for drug prices are incorporated based on UNICEF supply prices and the MSH drug price\r\ncatalogue. In practice, users of the tool will want to consult the appropriate country specific resources in order to have\r\naccurate inputs for system inputs such as the costs of facilities, transportation and other equipment"}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How does the tool help to ensure that the user fills in data in all relevant sections?", "answer": "The tool applies a logical framework in each section, guiding the user through a process of baseline data\r\nentry, situation analysis, strategic planning through various policy options, and viewing the anticipated costs\r\nand results. It is expected that the use of a logical framework will minimize the risk of the user\r\nunintentionally skipping relevant sections. In addition there is an overall dashboard which indicates to the\r\nuser which modules have been filled in, and which modules yet to be completed."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How will default data be updated?", "answer": "The IAWG-Costing will create mechanisms to ensure regular updates of price defaults as well as standard\r\ntreatment regimens, demographic projections, epidemiological data, etc.. At a minimum this will be done on\r\nan annual basis, and users will find information on the latest updates through OneHealth communications,\r\nincluding websites. Mechanisms for updates include negotiations with external data suppliers such as the\r\nManagement Sciences for Health (MSH) regarding an annual update to the OneHealth commodity price\r\ndatabase based on the most recent MSH drug price catalogue."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How is health impact calculated?", "answer": "Health impact is estimated through impact models directly linked to the targets and strategies identified by\r\nthe user within the tool. Three sub-models within OneHealth that draw upon UN epidemiological reference\r\ngroup models, a recognized gold standard, are fully incorporated as part of the OneHealth software: The Lives Saved Tool (LiST)1\r\n estimates impact for a range of child and maternal health\r\ninterventions, including malaria interventions. The AIDS Impact Model (AIM) model projects health impact for HIV/AIDS interventions The Family Planning (FamPlan) model computes the relationship between family planning and total\r\nfertility rate. The output is then communicated to the population projection parts of the tool. A newly developed tuberculosis (TB) model projects impact on TB health targets. Additional work is planned in the future to support further development of impact models where feasible, for\r\nexample for Non-Communicable diseases and Malaria in adults. Health outcome is measured as the number of health problems averted or a reduction in morbidity. For\r\nexample, the number of pneumonia deaths averted in children under-5 years is the number of deaths in the\r\ncase of constant coverage minus the number of deaths in a situation with increased intervention coverage."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "Can the user attribute health impact to specific health programmes or interventions?", "answer": "With regards to health impact in terms of lives saved, the results are communicated for the entire plan and\r\nnot per programme or for specific interventions. Given the considerable interaction between different\r\ninterventions and risk factors in the population it is important to show health impact as an aggregate, in\r\norder to take interactions into account and to avoid double counting. If a user would want to show the impact\r\nfor one specific programme only, s/he would need to run the analysis only with the selected interventions\r\nand interpret the results with caution."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How does the tool estimate impact for health interventions and for systems activities?", "answer": "In addition to direct health impact (mortality, morbidity), there are also other effect options built into the tool,\r\nsuch as the impact of retention incentives on reducing health worker attrition. Currently the tool does not\r\ninclude defaults of estimated effectiveness for many of these health system interventions, but work is\r\nongoing to undertake systematic reviews to collect data on the effectiveness of such activities. The user is\r\nable to enter his/her own assumptions for impact, and whenever defaults are provided, the user is\r\nencouraged to adjust these if there is local data available which is more appropriate."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "Can the tool be used to support disease-specific programme planning?", "answer": "Yes. The tool uses a systemic modular approach. The user can establish and define national disease\r\ncontrol programmes to match the country context, and then estimate the cost for a specific programme,\r\nincluding an analysis of broader health system implications. The format for programme planning is\r\nstreamlined such that a consistent approach is used across programmes. It is however encouraged that a\r\nprogramme plan looks at the broader health system constraints that may affect the delivery of the key\r\ninterventions. The OneHealth Tool enables disease-specific programme plans to be able to easily see the\r\nbroader planning process that incorporates the entire health system. The tool can be used to facilitate a\r\ndiscussion on resource allocation and priority setting both between and within programmes."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "To what extent does the tool include defaults for disease-specific programme activities?", "answer": "Programme activities are planned to support interventions scale-up. This includes activities related to\r\nmonitoring and supervision, programme-specific in-service training courses to build skills of health workers,\r\nprogramme planning and updating of guidelines. Many of these activities can be considered relatively\r\nstandardized, for example the type of equipment required to deliver TB services, and the recommended\r\ntraining courses to ensure that health workers have the skills necessary to deliver high quality interventions. In order to simplify data entry, OneHealth includes default information on programmatic activities where\r\nthese are standardized. This includes, where available, details on specific in-service training courses, and\r\nstandard surveys that may be implemented for M&E of each programme. The intention is to provide default\r\ninformation, in order to reduce the data entry load on the user and to provide a check list of activities. The\r\ndefault assumptions for programme activities are based on expert opinion of the appropriate technical\r\ndepartments as to what kind of activities would need to be planned for within a national programme planning\r\nframework. It should be noted that the user must actively choose each activity and set a specific target in\r\norder for that activity to be included in the plan with an associated cost. The user guide makes it clear that\r\nthese are to be treated as suggested activities for consideration, and not an absolute requirement for\r\nscaling-up. The advantage of using defaults is that users can apply defaults, reviewing and changing values as needed.\r\nIt also helps to facilitate understanding of how the tool works, and what kind of data should be entered into\r\neach section. The disadvantage is that users may be encouraged to select as many of the default activities\r\nas possible without considering true programme needs. In general, the user is encouraged to review the defaults that are used the tool so as to ensure that the\r\nassumptions are accurate for their application."}

Once the tool has been set up, the recommendation is however that the\r\nhealth systems modules for Human Resources for Health ( HRH) and Infrastructure are filled in first, to\r\nprovide a basis for projecting the health system's capacity to deliver services over the coming years. Next,\r\nthe service and intervention planning can be done (by disease-specific programme or by health service\r\nlevels). The scale-up of interventions will affect the Logistics and Supply chain planning for medicines and\r\ncommodities. Planning will be iterative, and several cycles of adjustments are likely needed. Financial space may be estimated prior to costing or following the first round of costing and then compared\r\nwith the cost estimates produced with the tool. In the process of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework\r\n(MTEF) , the financial ceiling may have already been set and planning within each module (health systems,\r\nservices) should then be done within the anticipated resource envelope."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How does OneHealth link to the Joint Assessment of National Strategies (JANS)?", "answer": "Joint assessment is a shared approach to evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of a national strategy. It\r\nincludes an examination of the strengths and weaknesses of generic attributes that are considered to be the\r\nfoundation of a 'good' national strategy.2\r\n OneHealth primarily responds to the first key attribute of the JANS\r\ncriteria, namely to ensure that the strategies outlined within the plan are based on a rigorous situation\r\nanalysis. Moreover the software facilitates an assessment of priority health needs where planning is driven\r\nby explicit analysis of the current health system and what can realistically be achieved in the medium term.\r\nOneHealth facilitates a comprehensive budget/costing of the program areas covered by the national\r\nstrategy, and allows for analysis related to issues of equity and access."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "To what extent can OneHealth be used in countries where there is decentralized planning?", "answer": "The tool has a function whereby projections can be created for subnational planning and later combined to\r\nform the basis for an overall national health plan. This of course requires input data to be available at this\r\nsub-national level."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How can costs be assessed for the private / non-state sector?", "answer": "The tool is primarily developed for estimating budget for public sector activities but may also be used to take\r\ninto account considerations of planning for activities carried out within the private sector. This includes\r\nservice delivery by private providers, working in public-private sector partnership, training and accreditation,\r\nand monitoring the quality of care provided. Moreover the financial projections take into account health\r\nsector financing from private sector sources, including households."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "Can the tool be used for equity-sensitive planning, for example targeting specific\r\ninterventions to specific sub-groups within the population?", "answer": "The tool has a function whereby multiple projections can be developed and viewed side by side. In this\r\nmanner a separate projection can be created for each sub-group. Different strategies can be developed and\r\ncosted for different demographic groups, for example low-income quintile vs. other quintiles, and the outputs\r\ncan later be combined to inform one national health plan. This would however require data to be available\r\nand inputted for the different population subgroups. Activities and targets can be specified within each\r\nprojection. 3"}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How can OneHealth support an MTEF or a SWAp?", "answer": "A Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is a multi-year public expenditure planning exercise that is\r\nused to set out future budget requirements for planned services and strategic activities, and to analyse\r\nthese within the likely resource envelope available according to the finance department expenditure ceilings.\r\nWhile the MTEF is often multi-sectoral, there is also a need to plan within the resource envelope specific to\r\nhealth. A sector-wide approach (SWAp) is a process whereby all significant government and donor funding\r\nfor the sector is aligned to support a single sector policy and expenditure programme. OneHealth can support MTEF and SWAp processes through facilitating the alignment with desired\r\ncharacteristics such as: - Costs estimated based on a bottom-up, evidence based approach - Revenue flows, including aid flows, estimated over time based on realistic targets. - Future implications of policy decisions are modeled and their affordability considered - The basis for MTEF costs and revenue projections is transparent, thus line departments need to\r\nplan activities explicitly and their implementation can also be monitored over time. - The national health strategy is evidence based and inputs can be compared with costs, outputs\r\nand health outcomes facilitating a priority setting process. This should facilitate buy-in from external\r\ndonors."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "How does the tool support informed priority setting?", "answer": "The tool enables priority setting in several ways. First, the tool includes a function for performing bottleneck analysis. The function of the bottleneck analysis\r\nis to identify strategies that would facilitate scaling up the interventions. This is done by using indicators to\r\nindicate system and programme performance for different levels of access. The approach is done using six\r\ncoverage indicators: – availability of essential commodities, – availability of human resources, – physical accessibility, – initial utilization, – timely continuous utilization, and – effective quality coverage of services. Note that it is the last level - the effective quality coverage of services - that can be directly linked to the final\r\ncoverage, and thus the health impact modeling. Second, costs are compared with the financial resources available, which compel the users to consider their\r\nfinancial limitations and plan realistically. Third, the tool is designed to illustrate health system implications of\r\nscaling up intervention delivery, and to show the capital investment gap. The fact that the tool highlights to\r\nthe user where intervention scale-up would be difficult given a weak health system helps place emphasis on\r\nthe need to strengthen systems for sustainable long term planning, informing choices. Fourth, policy levers\r\nwithin modules can be adjusted and the user can observe the effects on targets (both system and health\r\nimpact targets). Fifth, multiple projections can be launched and viewed side by side, varying certain\r\nparameters and observing how costs and outputs change."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "What will happen to existing tools when OneHealth is rolled out?", "answer": "The OneHealth tool was developed responding to country requests for a single tool which reflects the best\r\naspects of the various tools in existence but which strengthens integrated planning. While the goal of the\r\nIAWG-Costing is that OneHealth will demonstrate significant added value, acknowledging that the choice of\r\nwhich tool to use remains the decision of a country based on their needs and preferences. Additionally\r\nsome existing tools could be modified to serve as complementary tools to OneHealth; for example where\r\nappropriate they can serve to calculate costs that would then be used as inputs in OneHealth. Existing tools\r\ncould also be reformatted into data collection tools for OneHealth."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "Does the planning for medical equipment include operating costs?", "answer": "Yes, both capital and operating costs are included."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "Are costs shown in current or constant prices?", "answer": "The tool currently estimates costs in constant prices but a function to adjust for inflation will be programmed\r\ninto the tool as an option."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "What processes are in place to ensure that assumptions and modelling metrics for impact\r\nassessment is agreed upon though expert group consultation?", "answer": "Existing models for health impact as developed and supported by the UN epidemiological reference groups,\r\nare integrated into the tool. These models are reviewed by expert groups on a regular basis, and updates on\r\ntheir modeling parameters are regularly published in peer review articles. 4 For other components of the tool, such as Logistics, HRH and health financing policy, expert groups have\r\nbeen created specifically to provide technical guidance on the development of individual modules within\r\nOneHealth. This includes experts from participating UN agencies as well as external resource persons with\r\nspecific expertise in discussion given area. To date expert groups include the following: Governance; HIS,\r\nHRH, Logistics, Infrastructure (health technologies), Private sector; Equity and Gender, Health Financing\r\nPolicy, as well as a number of disease-programme planning specific discussion groups.\r\nComposition of (mednet) expert groups to date has been formed through suggestions made by participating\r\nIAWG members. All IAWG agencies are encouraged to continue to nominate experts for the discussion\r\ngroups, to ensure that there is broad representation, including country experts and CSOs. Frameworks for health system planning and impact modeling will evolve over time. IAWG-Costing will\r\ninstitute mechanisms to support regular technical meetings which will discuss updates to OneHealth. At a\r\nminimum this will be done on an annual basis."}
{"topic": "/questions-and-answers-on-the-onehealth-tool", "question": "Has the Tool Been Tested?", "answer": "Individual components of OneHealth have been tested in their previous formats as individual tools. This\r\nincludes the pre-existing widely applied impact modules, e.g., LiSTand FamPlan, as well as components\r\nand logic of planning and costing tools such as the RH costing tool, MBB, etc., which have been subject to\r\nconsiderable review, testing and documentation.\r\nMoreover, independent experts have been invited to peer review the newly developed modules such as the\r\nTB impact module; and the HRH module. Testing of the full OneHealth tool prior to its application in countries includes desk reviews undertaken by\r\ncountry health planners. A first desk review was performed for Burkina Faso between May-August 2011.\r\nThis desk review included three objectives. First, it entailed testing the functionality of the software and\r\nobtaining feedback from country planners on the format of the tool including the logic of organization, ease\r\nof navigation, and usefulness of default data provided. Second, the review examined content of the current\r\nversion to assess to what extent it captures elements of existing country health plans. Third, an assessment\r\nof the added value of OneHealth compared to other tools that were used for costing the national health plans was conducted. Two additional desk reviews are ongoing using data from DRC and Lao PDR and will\r\nbe completed in early 2012."}

{"topic": "/why-is-smoking-an-issue-for-non-smokers", "question": "Why is smoking an issue for non-smokers?", "answer": "There are some 4000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke; at least \r\n250 of them are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause \r\ncancer in humans. Tobacco smoke in enclosed spaces is breathed in by \r\neveryone, exposing smokers and nonsmokers alike to its harmful effects. Around 700 million children, or almost half of the world's \r\ntotal, breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Over 40% of children have \r\nat least one smoking parent. In 2004, children accounted for 31% of the \r\n600 000 premature deaths attributable to second-hand smoke. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and\r\n respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer.\r\n In infants, it causes sudden death syndrome. In pregnant women, it \r\ncauses low birth weight. Neither ventilation nor filtration, even in combination, can \r\nreduce tobacco smoke exposure indoors to levels that are considered \r\nacceptable. Only 100% smoke-free environments provide effective \r\nprotection. Contrary to common belief, smoke-free environments are \r\nwidely supported by both smokers and nonsmokers. Having a smoke-free environment often saves money for bars and\r\n restaurant owners, reducing their risks of fire and consequently their \r\ninsurance costs. It often results in lower renovation, cleaning and \r\nmaintenance costs, too. Article 8 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, \r\nrecognizes that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and \r\ndisability, and asks countries to adopt and implement legislation that \r\nprovides protection from second-hand smoke. Many countries around the world have already introduced laws \r\nto protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places. \r\nCelebrations around the globe on World No Tobacco Day (31 May) encourage\r\n more people and more countries to go smoke-free. Join the trend by claiming your right to public places that are 100% smoke-free inside. Related links Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI)"}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-thiomersal", "question": "What is thiomersal?", "answer": "Thiomersal is the most widely-used preservative for vaccines. Thiomersal is a compound containing ethyl mercury used to \nprevent bacterial and fungal growth in some inactivated vaccines in \nmulti-dose vials. It is also used during production of specific vaccines, for \nexample certain pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines, as part of the \nmanufacturing process that makes the product safe and effective. \nThiomersal has been  used  since the 1930s in the manufacture of some \nvaccines and other medicinal products."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-thiomersal", "question": "Why do vaccines need preservatives?", "answer": "Preservatives inhibit growth of bacterial and fungal contaminants,\n which may be introduced during repeated use of a multi-dose vial. \nMulti-dose vials are used in many countries because they require less \nstorage space in the cold-chain and lead to less wastage, both of which \nhave a significant impact on programme costs. In many countries, for \ninactivated vaccines supplied in multi-dose vials, the presence of a \npreservative is a regulatory requirement."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-thiomersal", "question": "Does the amount of thiomersal in vaccines pose a health risk ?", "answer": "WHO has closely monitored scientific evidence relating to the use \nof thiomersal as a vaccine preservative for over 10 years, in particular\n through its independent expert advisory group, the Global Advisory \nCommittee on Vaccine Safety. The Committee has consistently reached the \nsame conclusion: there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of \nthiomersal used in vaccines poses a health risk. Other expert groups \n(for example the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicine, and the \nEuropean Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) have reached \nsimilar conclusions."}
{"topic": "/vaccines-and-immunization-thiomersal", "question": "What would be the health impact of restricting thiomersal-containing vaccines ?", "answer": "Immunization with thiomersal-containing multi-dose vaccines \ncurrently protects at least 64% of all infants and children against four\n diseases with high mortality rates: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b. The use of thiomersal-containing vaccines to protect against \nthese diseases averted  at least 1 400 000 child deaths in 2010. \nThiomersal-containing vaccines are being used in over 120 countries. \nRemoving thiomersal completely from vaccines would require either using \nalternative preservatives or using preservative-free single dose \nvaccines exclusively. Alternatives would incur significant costs for \ndevelopment and regulatory approval, thereby limiting the ability to \noffer affordable vaccines. Use of multi-dose vials is the most efficient and \ncost-effective way to protect populations when vaccines need to be \nadministered to large numbers of people in a short space of time, such \nas in epidemic or pandemic situations."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What is the current risk of radiation-related health problems in Japan for those residing near the reactor in comparison to those in other parts of Japan?", "answer": "During the early phase of the nuclear emergency, radiation-related health was dependent on exposure, which is turn was due to several things, including the amount and type of radiation released from the reactor; weather conditions, such as wind and rain; a person’s proximity to the plant; and the amount of time spent in irradiated areas. The Government of Japan’s early actions in response to events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were in line with the existing recommendations for radiation exposure. The Government has evacuated individuals who were living within a 20-kilometre radius around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Those living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant were asked to evacuate voluntarily. In general, people living farther away of the site of the event are at lower risk than those who live nearby. In light of evolving new information on levels of environmental radioactivity in the 20-30 km zone and some surrounding areas beyond the 30km zone, the Government of Japan established new planned evacuation zones from which residents were relocated to temporary housing based on the estimated cumulative doses they may receive in the 1 year following the accident. In addition, an emergency evacuation preparedness zone was also identified in which residents were asked to prepare their affairs in case they were asked to evacuate. These zones also follow administrative boundaries and extend beyond the 30 km radius."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Is there a risk of radioactive exposure from food contamination?", "answer": "Yes, there is a risk of exposure as a result of contamination in food. However, contaminated food would have to be consumed over prolonged periods to represent a risk to human health. The radioactive iodine and caesium in concentrations above the Japanese regulatory limits have been detected in some food commodities as a result of food monitoring Japanese authorities have advised residents to avoid these foods and have implemented measures to prevent their sale and distribution."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Are there health risks to people living outside of Japan from radiation emitted into the atmosphere from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants?", "answer": "Thus far, there are no health risks to people living in other countries from radioactive material released into the atmosphere from the Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in every day circumstances. Radiation levels have been monitored by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which operates 63 surveillance stations around the world.

{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Are people normally exposed to ionizing radiation?", "answer": "Human beings are exposed to natural radiation (also known as background radiation) on a daily basis. Natural radiation comes from space (i.e. cosmic rays) as well as from naturally-occurring radioactive materials found in the soil, water and air. Radon gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is the main source of natural radiation. People can also be exposed to radiation from artificial sources. Today, the most common artificial sources of ionizing radiation are X-ray machines and other medical devices. Radiation doses can be expressed in Sievert (Sv) units. On average, a person is exposed to approximately 3.0 milli Sieverts (mSv)/year, of which 80% (2.4 mSv) is due to naturally-occurring sources (i.e., background radiation), 19.6 % (almost 0.6 mSv) is due to the medical use of radiation and the remaining 0.4% (around 0.01 mSv) is due to other sources of human-made radiation. In some parts of the world, levels of exposure to natural radiation differ due to local geology. People in some areas can be exposed to more than 200 times the global average."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What is ionizing radiation?", "answer": "When certain atoms disintegrate, they release a type of energy called ionizing radiation. This energy can travel as either electromagnetic waves (i.e. gamma or X-rays) or as particles (i.e. alpha, beta or neutrons). The atoms that emit radiation are called radionuclides; e.g., radioactive iodine, caesium, and plutonium. Ionizing radiation is an essential tool for diagnosis and treatment in medicine, that must be used with rigorous attention to safety."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "How are people exposed to ionizing radiation?", "answer": "Ionizing radiation may result from sources outside or inside of the body (i.e. external irradiation or internal contamination). External irradiation is produced when a person is exposed to external sources (i.e. X-rays) or when radioactive material (i.e. dust, liquid, or aerosols) becomes attached to skin or clothes. Internal contamination may result from breathing in or swallowing radioactive material or through contamination of wounds."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What type of radiation exposure could occur in a nuclear power plant accident?", "answer": "In the event a nuclear power plant does not function properly, individuals, land, and structures in the vicinity of the plant could be exposed to a mixture of radioactive products generated inside the reactor, also known as “nuclear fission products”. The main radionuclides representing health risk are radioactive caesium and radioactive iodine. Members of the public may be exposed directly to radionuclides, either in the air or if food and water become contaminated by these materials. Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers may be exposed to radioactive materials and higher radiation doses inside or around the power plant due to their professional activities."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What is the WHO travel advice for Japan?", "answer": "WHO has not issued any advice on general restrictions regarding travel to Japan. During the early phase of the emergency, travellers were advised to avoid travel to the areas most affected by the earthquake and tsunami because of disruptions to essential services, such as transport and electric power. The ongoing disaster relief activities, including the nuclear power plant emergency response and control activities, would have made travel difficult and could have consumed resources needed by relief workers and residents. Moreover, as indicated by the Japanese authorities, travel within the evacuation and exclusion zones surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was prohibited. In general, travellers who do not have essential reasons to travel were advised to give careful consideration to deferring travel to any areas where there had been considerable disruption to the normal infrastructure and where authorities were responding to urgent humanitarian needs. The situation in Japan has improved. Residents are being temporary allowed access into some areas that had been evacuated, but restrictions still exist. The Government of Japan is monitoring the situation and plans to lift restrictions once safety conditions are met. Information on the status of the nuclear facilities in Fukushima can be found on Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) website and on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website. Travellers should be aware of the risk of further earthquakes across Japan. Moreover, there may be areas of power, fuel, food and water shortages. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Do travellers returning from Japan represent a health risk for others?", "answer": "At this time, only those involved in the emergency response near the nuclear power plant remain in the area where there are higher levels of radioactivity. For their own safety, all personnel in these areas should undergo decontamination procedures when they leave the site. Travellers returning from Japan who have come from the 20 km evacuation zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and who have undergone proper screening and decontamination procedures, and travellers from all other areas, do not pose a radioactive health risk to others and do not require screening."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What are the acute health effects of radiation exposure?", "answer": "If the dose of radiation exceeds a certain threshold level, it can produce acute effects, including skin redness, hair loss, radiation burns, and acute radiation syndrome (ARS). In a nuclear power plant accident, the general population is not likely to be exposed to doses high enough to cause such effects. Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers are more likely to be exposed to doses of radiation high enough to cause acute effects."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What long-term effects can be expected from radiation exposure?", "answer": "Exposure to ionizing doses of radiation can increase the risk of cancer. Radioactive iodine can be released during nuclear emergencies. If radioactive iodine is breathed in or swallowed, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Among persons exposed to radioactive iodine, the risk of thyroid cancer can be lowered by taking potassium iodide pills, which helps prevent the uptake of the radioactive iodine. The risk of thyroid cancer following radiation exposure is higher in children and young adults."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Does radiation exposure pose a risk to foetuses?", "answer": "Foetuses are at risk of brain damage from radiation during weeks 8-25 of gestation. Studies have shown brain damage in foetuses following exposure to an acute dose of radiation exceeding 100 mSv during weeks 8-15 and an acute dose exceeding 200 mSv during weeks 16-25. Outside of weeks 8-25, studies have not shown radiation risk to the fetal brain. Foetal exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer in childhood. Studies have shown this effect with doses above 100 mSv. Dose comparisons for ionising radiation Health Protection Agency (UK) web site"}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What emotional impact can a nuclear accident have on children? How can they be assisted?", "answer": "Disasters and their aftermath can have a profound emotional impact on children and may result in long term behavioural disturbances. Children exhibiting signs of stress - including difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, developing new fears, changes in behaviour (e.g. clinging, bedwetting), being preoccupied with the crisis - should receive extra time and attention from family members and other caregivers. Children are among the most vulnerable of those affected by a nuclear accident because of their inability to fully understand and process the immediate and long-term effects of the emergency. Family members and caregivers should try to find out what the child thinks and feels about the disaster. If the child is scared because she/he has misunderstood what has happened, then simple explanations should be provided while avoiding alarming details. Children need a chance to play and relax. Encourage older children to be helpful and maintain regular routines. Reactions to stress can depend on developmental level and are generally marked by changes in typical behaviour for a specific child or adolescent. Reactions may continue for days, weeks or even months. Children should see a paediatrician or mental health professional if anxiety or grief interferes with their daily functioning, or if these emotions do not reduce with time. Early management of these symptoms can speed recovery and prevent long-term consequences.

{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Which public health actions are most important to take?", "answer": "Health effects can only occur if someone is exposed to radiation, thus the main protective action someone can take is to prevent exposure. Those closest to the radiation source are at greatest risk of exposure and the greater the distance away, the lower the risk. In the early phase of a nuclear emergency (within the first hours/days), urgent protective actions may be implemented to prevent radiation exposure, taking into account projected doses that people may received in the short-term (e.g. within 2-7 days). These necessary actions depend on the estimated exposure (i.e., the amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere and the prevailing meteorological conditions, such as wind and rain. Actions may include: evacuation of the area around or near the nuclear power plant; advising people to shelter in their homes, offices, other secure buildings or designated shelters to reduce exposure; and distributing and administering potassium iodide pills to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer). When environmental and human monitoring data increases, relocation of people to temporary housing may be considered in particular areas, taking into account the radiation doses that residents may receive over the long-term (e.g. one year). If warranted, public health or national authorities may restrict or prohibit the consumption of vegetables and dairy products produced in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant in order to reduce exposure. Monitoring programs are established to inform longer term decisions on food restriction, water consumption, and the control of internationally traded foodstuffs. Only competent authorities who have conducted a careful analysis of the emergency situation are in a position to recommend which of these public health measures should be undertaken."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "How can I protect myself?", "answer": "Keep informed by obtaining accurate and authoritative information (e.g., information from authorities delivered by radio, TV or the Internet) and following your government's instructions. The decision to take potassium iodide should be based on information provided by national health authorities who will be in the best position to determine if this step is warranted."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "If I have been exposed to radioactive material released into the environment, what should I do?", "answer": "If you are coming indoors after exposure to radioactive material, undress in the doorway to avoid further contamination in your home or shelter. Remove clothing and shoes and place them in a plastic bag. Seal the bag and place it in a safe location away from living areas, children, and pets. Shower or bathe with warm water and soap. Notify authorities that you may have contaminated clothing and personal belongings to be handled appropriately and disposed of according to accepted national procedures."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "When people are advised to stay indoors, what does this mean?", "answer": "When a radiological or nuclear event occurs, public health authorities may order residents in the affected areas to stay indoors rather than evacuate. You may be advised to take shelter at home, at work, or in public shelters. Shelter can provide protection from external exposure and from inhalation of radioactive material. If you are advised to stay indoors, you should find the safest room in your house or office building: if possible, one which has no windows and no external doors. Ventilation systems, such as heating and cooling systems, should be shut down. In sub-zero temperatures, it is important to keep warm. If you have been instructed to shelter in your home, office, or other structure, it may not be safe to burn fuels—such as gas, coal, or wood—to keep warm. Doing so may result in carbon monoxide poisoning, which can occur when rooms are not adequately ventilated. If it is available, electrical forms of heating are safer."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What are potassium iodide pills?", "answer": "Potassium iodide pills are a source of stable (i.e. non-radioactive) iodine. The thyroid gland requires iodine to produce thyroid hormones. The presence of stable iodine in the body in an appropriate amount blocks the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine (radioiodine), reducing the risk of thyroid cancer which may follow from exposure to radioiodine. Potassium iodide pills are not “radiation antidotes”. They do not protect against external radiation, or against any other radioactive substances besides radioiodine. They may also cause medical complications for some individuals with poorly functioning kidneys. Potassium iodide should be taken only when there is a clear public health recommendation."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "When and why should I take potassium iodide?", "answer": "You should only take potassium iodide when it is recommended by public health authorities. If you are at risk or have been exposed to radioiodine, potassium iodide pills may be given to protect the thyroid gland from uptake of radioiodine. This can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in the long run, when given before or shortly after exposure."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Should I take iodized salt to protect myself from radiation?", "answer": "No, you should not take iodized salt to protect yourself from radiation. It is dangerous to take large amounts of iodized salt in order to increase the amount of stable iodine in the body. Increasing one's daily intake of iodized salt will cause more harm than good. The main ingredient of iodized salt is sodium chloride, which is linked with hypertension (high blood pressure) and other medical disorders. The iodine content in iodized salt is too low to prevent uptake of radioiodine. Sodium chloride is acutely toxic in large amounts: even tablespoon quantities of salt repeatedly taken over a short period of time could cause poisoning."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Can I take other forms of iodine?", "answer": "No, you should not take products that contain iodine, other than medicines recommended by public health authorities. Iodine is found in a variety of household and industrial products. For example, iodine may be found in some disinfectants, antiseptics, and water-sterilizing solutions. These products should not be taken as an alternative to potassium iodide pills, because such products contain other ingredients that can be harmful if swallowed."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Can pregnant women take potassium iodide pills?", "answer": "Yes, most pregnant women can take potassium iodide pills, following the instructions of public health authorities. Potassium iodide will cross the placenta and protect the thyroid of the growing foetus, as well as the mother."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What are the recommendations for breastfeeding women regarding potassium iodide?", "answer": "As with the rest of the population, breastfeeding women should take potassium iodide tablets only when advised by public health authorities. However, this will not be sufficient to fully protect the breastfed child who will need potassium iodide as well, in special doses adapted for newborns and infants. Under these conditions, breastfeeding can continue."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Can food produced in other countries be affected by the events in Japan?", "answer": "Radioactive material has been released into the environment from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in everyday circumstances and do not present health or transportation safety hazards, according to the United Nations organizations closely monitoring the situation. Minute amounts of radioactive caesium and iodine might be found using very sensitive detection methods but this should not affect foods produced in other countries as the amounts involved will be well below acceptable levels and would not pose a health concern to those who eat the food."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What are the potential health effects of consuming contaminated food?", "answer": "Consuming food contaminated with radioactive material will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The exact effect will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount. According to data reported so far, radioactive iodine and caesium are the main contaminants, and concentrations in some food samples have been detected at levels above the Japanese regulatory limits. Radioactive iodine has a half-life of eight days and decays naturally within weeks. If ingested, it can accumulate in the body, particularly the thyroid gland, and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children. The ingestion of potassium iodide is an established method to prevent the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid. Radioactive caesium has a half-life longer than that of radioactive iodine (up to 30 years) and can stay in the environment for many years. Like all radionuclides, exposure to radiation from radioactive caesium can result in an increased risk of cancer."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Is all food production in Japan affected by the nuclear emergency?", "answer": "No, not all foods will be affected. Food that was dispatched or commercially packaged before the emergency situation would not be affected. However, some food produced in areas where radioactive material has been deposited has been found to be contaminated. This is why the Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring and are taking measures to address the issue."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What impact will this have on food and food production in Japan?", "answer": "The impact on food and food production in Japan will depend upon the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited or present where food is being produced or harvested. Although radioactive iodine in food is of immediate concern after nuclear emergencies, it has a relatively short half-life and will naturally decay over a short time frame. Radioactive caesium has also been detected in food. In contrast to radioactive iodine, radioactive caesium can linger in the environment for many years and could continue to present a longer term problem for food, and food production, and a threat to human health."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "How do food products become radioactive?", "answer": "Foods can become contaminated with radioactive materials when they are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. In these circumstances, radioactive material falling from the air or carried in rain water or snow, can deposit on the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed. Also, over time, radioactivity can build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals. Radioactivity can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take up the radionuclides. The severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released. Radioactivity cannot contaminate food that is packaged; for example, tinned or plastic-wrapped food is protected from radioactivity as long as the food is sealed."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Why is food affected in areas beyond the evacuation zone?", "answer": "During a nuclear emergency, an evacuation zone is established to prevent people from being exposed to immediate and unacceptable levels of radiation posing a threat to human health. However, contamination of food can occur through uptake from soil to crops, or to animals through feed, even when levels of radioactive contamination are lower than those which might pose a direct threat to human health. The standards for acceptable limits for radioactivity in food are set at low levels in order to take into account the possibility of contaminated food being eaten over an extended period of time and resulting in a cumulative dose."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for international trade?", "answer": "There are internationally agreed Codex Guideline Levels (GLs) for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. These GLs are published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission. The GLs state that, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding Guideline Level, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption. When the Guideline Levels are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the Guideline Levels may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small addition to the total dose, the Guideline Levels may be increased by a factor of 10”. GLs for radionuclide levels can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995) Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed (CODEX STAN 193-1995)"}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What actions are being taken to monitor the safety of food from Japan?", "answer": "In response to the nuclear accident in Japan, Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring of food products and have restricted the consumption and distribution of some products in certain prefectures, or areas found to contain radionuclides exceeding Japan's provisional regulation value. Findings from food monitoring in Japan and decisions related to the consumption and distribution of food products are published regularly on the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare web site. Many countries have implemented food control measures to mirror actions taken within Japan. Some countries have indicated they now require documentation verifying the safety of products and/or the prefecture of origin of the food. Other countries have suspended food imports from Japan. In addition, many countries have increased monitoring on foods imported from Japan. Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare"}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "What general advice can be given to food consumers and producers in the event of a nuclear emergency?", "answer": "The response to an emergency involving radioactivity should be the same as the response to any emergency involving any hazardous material contaminating food. In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the contamination of food by radiological materials. For example, it is possible to do the following: protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins; close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables; bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn; harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; and don’t harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded. Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as: avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables; avoid slaughtering animals; avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); and avoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.

{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Can I drink the tap water in Japan?", "answer": "Drinking tap water in Japan poses no immediate health risk The Japanese authorities closely monitored the situation and issued advice, when needed, against consumption of tap water, including specific recommendations for infants. Essential hydration of infants should not be compromised in an attempt to reduce exposure to radionuclide contamination. The standards adopted by the Japanese authorities for this emergency are precautionary. In the case of radioactive iodine the standard for adults is 300 Becquerels per litre in drinking-water. In the very unlikely scenario that drinking-water was contaminated and consumed for an entire year at this level, the additional radiation exposure from this water would be equivalent to natural background radiation during one year. During the early phase of the emergency WHO urged people in the area to heed the advice of local authorities, as they have access to the latest measurements of radiation levels in water to compare against the standards for adults and children. Currently, restrictions of consumption of tap water have been lifted in all prefectures."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Can radioactive contamination be removed from water?", "answer": "Standard water treatment procedures may remove significant amounts of radioactive contaminants. Other options to reduce concentrations of radiation contaminants include controlled dilution of contaminated water with non-contaminated water. Boiling water will not remove radioactive iodine."}
{"topic": "/radiation-japan-nuclear-concerns", "question": "Why do the guidance levels for radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water vary?", "answer": "The guidance levels found in different sets of recommendations vary because some apply to routine situations and others to emergency situations. The table below summarizes the guidance on radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water and provides an indication\r\n    of the equivalent exposure from routine activities. Guideline name Advised maximum levels for radioactive activity in water (Bq/L) Approximate equivalent radiation exposure if consuming water at this activity level for a year WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (1) 10 A New York - London flight Japanese provisional (emergency) standard for adults (2) 300 One year's exposure to natural background radiation, or 10-15 chest X-rays Japanese provisional (emergency) standard for infants (3) 100 IAEA Operational Intervention Level for nuclear emergencies (4) 3000 Not applicable. The advised maximum level should be used only to trigger action in the early stages of the emergency (1) WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality should not be taken as the reference point for nuclear emergencies because the levels set are extremely conservative, and designed to apply to lifetime routine intake. (2) Provisional regulation values relating to limits on food and drink ingestion, established by the Japanese Food Sanitation Act, as indicated by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan. These standards are precautionary and have taken international guidance\r\n    into consideration, including recommendations of the IAEA and the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

In doing so, WHO is working with independent experts and other UN agencies. WHO's work is supported by a global network comprising more than 40 specialized institutions in radiation emergency medicine.

{"topic": "/child-health-and-development", "question": "Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?", "answer": "Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as giving no other food or drink – not\n    even water – except breast milk. It does, however, allow the infant to receive oral rehydration salts (ORS), drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines).

{"topic": "/child-health-and-development", "question": "When and how should a child transition to other foods?", "answer": "WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at \nsix months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be\n adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and \nmicronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional\n    needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to \nminimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires \nactive care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.

{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What happened?", "answer": "On 26 April 1986, an explosion and fires at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine caused the largest\nuncontrolled radioactive release in the history of the civil nuclear industry. Over the next 10 days, large\nquantities of radioactive iodine and caesium were released into the air. Most of this material was\ndeposited near the installation, but lighter material was carried by wind currents over Belarus, the\nRussian Federation and Ukraine and, to some extent, over parts of Europe."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What were the main radionuclides to which people were exposed?", "answer": "The main radionuclides to which individuals were exposed were iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium137. Iodine-131 has a short radioactive half-life (eight days) and can be transferred to humans rapidly\nthrough the air and by consumption of contaminated milk and leafy vegetables. Iodine becomes\nlocalized in the thyroid gland. Because many infants and children consume relatively large quantities of\nmilk and dairy products, and because of the size of their thyroid glands and the nature of their\nmetabolism, exposure to radioactive iodine is usually higher for children than for adults. Caesium isotopes have longer half-lives (caesium-134 and caesium-137 have half-lives of 2 years and\n30 years, respectively). There are thus longer-term exposures to these radionuclides through the\ningestion pathway and through external exposure from their deposition on the ground."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What levels of exposure did people experience?", "answer": "The average effective doses among 530,000 recovery operation workers was 120 millisieverts (mSv);\namong 115,000 evacuees, 30 mSv; among residents of contaminated areas, 9 mSv (during the first two\ndecades after the accident); and among residents of other European countries, less than 1 mSv (in the\nfirst year after the accident).\nIn more distant countries, doses of exposure decreased progressively in subsequent years. Since such\ndoses are below the global average annual dose of 2.4 mSv from natural background radiation, the\nradiation exposures in countries distant from Chernobyl are considered to be of little radiological and\npublic health significance."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What were the impacts on health from Chernobyl?", "answer": "In 2006, WHO published its report summarizing the data from two decades of research on the health\nconsequences of the Chernobyl accident. It included reviews of studies carried out on cancers, noncancer diseases, immune and genetic effects, and reproductive and children’s health, as well as\nevidence-based recommendations for national health authorities and for further research. In 2011, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)\npublished a report entitled \"Health effects due to radiation from the Chernobyl accident.\" The findings\nwere based on more than two decades of experimental and analytical studies of the health\nconsequences of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl accident. The report is the most comprehensive\nevaluation to date of exposure levels and health effects from the Chernobyl accident. Radiation sickness According to the UNSCEAR report, the Chernobyl accident caused a number of severe radiation\neffects almost immediately. Of 600 workers present on the site during the early morning of 26 April\n1986, 134 received very high doses (0.8-16 Grey) and suffered from acute radiation sickness. Of those,\n28 workers died in the first three months. Radiation-induced cataracts Among those who survived radiation sickness, recovery took several years. Many of them developed\nradiation-induced cataracts in the first few years after the accident. Recent studies of the recovery\noperation workers indicate that opacities of the eye lens might result from radiation doses lower than\npreviously expected (about 500 mSv). Cancers For the last two decades, attention has been focused on investigating the association between exposure\nto radionuclides released in the Chernobyl accident and late effects, in particular thyroid cancer. In the\nfirst few months after the accident, radiation dose exposures to the thyroid received were particularly\nhigh in children and adolescents living in Belarus, Ukraine and the most affected regions of the Russian\nFederation, and in those who drank milk with high levels of radioactive iodine. By 2005, more than\n6,000 thyroid cancer cases had been diagnosed in this group. It is most likely that a large fraction of\nthese thyroid cancers are attributable to radioiodine intake. Furthermore, it is expected that increases in\nthyroid cancer incidence due to the Chernobyl accident will continue for many more years, although\nlong-term increases are difficult to quantify. Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed at a young age,\nthere is some indication of increased leukaemia and cataract incidence among workers. Otherwise,\nthere is no clearly demonstrated increase in the incidence of solid cancers or leukaemia due to radiation\nin the exposed populations. There also is no convincing proof so far of increases in other nonmalignant disorders that are related to ionizing radiation. Among 530,000 registered recovery operation workers who worked between 1986 and 1990, the\naverage dose was 120 mSv (ranging from 20 to 500 mSv). That cohort is still potentially at risk of\ncancer and other diseases and their health continues to be closely followed. Among Russian recovery operation workers with higher average doses (above 200 mSv), evidence is\nemerging of some increase in the incidence of leukaemia. Based on other studies, the annual incidence\nof radiation-induced leukaemia would be expected to fall within a few decades after exposure. There is a tendency to attribute increases in rates of all cancers over time to the Chernobyl accident, but\nit should be noted that increases in cancer in the affected areas were also observed before the accident.\nMoreover, a general increase in mortality has been reported in recent decades in most areas of the\nformer Soviet Union, and this must be taken into account when interpreting the results of the accident-related studies. Persistent psychological or mental health problems Several international studies have reported that exposed populations, compared to controls, had anxiety\nsymptom levels that were twice as high and were more likely to report multiple unexplained physical\nsymptoms and subjective poor health. Given that rates of mental health problems increase after a\ndisaster and may manifest years after the event, WHO recommends improving availability and access\nto normal community mental health services in disaster-affected areas. One of the objectives of the on-going UN inter-agency International Chernobyl Research and\nInformation Network (ICRIN) project is to alleviate the stigma of psychological trauma in\nsociety, encourage self-reliance, and empower local communities to take control over their own lives.\nOne of the ways to achieve these goals is to promote healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and\nhealthy diet, and to explain the environmental, behavioural, and other risks for various chronic diseases,\nincluding cancer. Concerns related to fertility and birth defects In the Chernobyl-affected regions, there is no evidence of decreased fertility among males or females in\nthe general population. However, birth rates may be lower in contaminated areas because of a high rate\nof medical abortions. Since 1986, there has been a reported increase in congenital malformations in both contaminated and\nuncontaminated areas of Belarus which predated Chernobyl and may be the result of increased\nregistration of such cases. Based on dose levels to which the majority of the population was exposed,\nthere is unlikely to be a major effect on the number of stillbirths, adverse pregnancy outcomes, delivery\ncomplications, or the overall health of children, but monitoring remains important. Potential impact on health in other European countries So far, there has been no clear evidence of any measurable increases in adverse health effects related to\nthe Chernobyl radiation in countries outside of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine."}

{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What are some of the actions taken by the World Health Organization?", "answer": "See WHO's Involvement in the Chernobyl Accident for\nmore details on WHO involvement since 1986. 1991 The governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine asked the UN to examine the\nhealth effects of the Chernobyl accident and to visit the areas in question. WHO secured US$20 million\nin extra-budgetary funding to create a project on the health effects of Chernobyl. 1994 WHO's Regional Office for Europe initiated an international project on thyroid pathologies,\nwhich ran until September 2000. The project helped Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine\nenhance the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of thyroid pathologies and improve the methods of\nidentification of causes, nature, and estimated scope of radiation-induced thyroid cancer. Special\npriority was accorded to screening for thyroid cancer, establishment of an integrated database, medical\nexaminations for iodine deficiency, design of testing systems for measuring thyroid gland hormones,\ncapacity-building, including staff training. 1995 A WHO conference in Geneva brought together a broad variety of scientists from all over the\nworld and resulted in publication of a set of key papers in a special 1996 issue of the WHO Bulletin (a\ncopy of the journal is available upon request). 2002 The UN Strategy for Recovery gave all UN agencies and the international community a\nframework for rebuilding the most-affected areas of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. 2003 Within the UN Strategy for Recovery, representatives from the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Office for the\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), UNSCEAR, WHO and the World Bank and Belarus, the Russian\nFederation and Ukraine established and launched the Chernobyl Forum. 2006 The Chernobyl Forum released the most authoritative scientific findings of that time on the\naccident’s consequences for health and the environment. The health impact of the accident was summarized in the report developed by WHO — Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident and Special\nHealth Care Programmes. The WHO Expert Group \"Health\" (EGH) set criteria for inclusion in the report based on solid\nmethodology and reliable estimates of exposure assessment. Consequently, reports published in peerreviewed literature, and available by the time of the Expert Group meetings, were included. National\nexperts from Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine participated in each EGH meeting and\nshared the set criteria. The report was finalized at the end 2005 and published in spring 2006. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an international cancer research\ninstitution established by WHO, published estimated projections of 25,000 potential excess cancers for\nEurope (Cardis et al. 2006) through 2065 that might be attributable to exposure to radiation from\nChernobyl of which 16,000 cases could be fatal.\n2007-2008 Following the UN inter-agency Chernobyl Forum in 2006, the UN launched its Action Plan\nfor the third decade of Chernobyl until 2016. As part of the UN family, WHO has a mandate to\nimplement this Action Plan according to UN General Assembly resolutions. 2007-2008 Following the UN inter-agency Chernobyl Forum in 2006, the UN launched its Action Plan\nfor the third decade of Chernobyl until 2016. As part of the UN family, WHO has a mandate to\nimplement this Action Plan according to UN General Assembly resolutions. 2009-2011 The International Chernobyl Research and Information Network (ICRIN) was launched by\nfour United Nations agencies, as a part of the UN Action Plan implementation programme, to meet the\ninformation needs of affected communities in Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This threeyear initiative is part of a larger effort to help local communities “return to normal” in the course of the\ndecade that ends in 2016 and aims to translate the latest scientific information on the consequences of\nthe accident into sound practical advice for residents of the affected territories. Activities planned under\nthe ICRIN project include the dissemination of information, through education and training for teachers,\nmedical professionals, community leaders, and the media; providing local residents with practical\nadvice on health risks and healthy lifestyles; the creation of internet-equipped information centers in\nrural areas; and small-scale community infrastructure projects aimed at improving living conditions and\npromoting self-reliance. 2010 IARC completed an EC-funded project on the development of a strategic research agenda (SRA)\nfor Chernobyl studies (8), where a group of experts and advisors supports proposals for the long-term\nfunding of a Chernobyl Health Effects Research Foundation (similar to the action taken to create the\nRadiation Effects Research Foundation some years after the atomic bomb exposures in Japan) together\nwith a series of individual studies covering the main health consequences. These include a focus on\nthyroid cancer, breast cancer, inherited molecular-genetic alterations, various other cancers, cataracts,\nand other non-cancer diseases in nuclear plant workers and in the general, exposed population. 2011 An UNSCEAR report (9)  on Chernobyl recognized that while new research data has become\navailable, major conclusions regarding the scale and nature of the health consequences of the 1986\nChernobyl accident were \"essentially consistent with previous assessments\". UNSCEAR reported more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer, of which 15 have been fatal, among\npeople who were children or adolescents in Belarus, the four most affected regions in the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. A substantial proportion of cases were associated with radiation exposure.\nThe report also reconfirmed that radiation doses to the public from the 1986 accident were relatively\nlow and most residents \"need not live in fear of serious health consequences\". Ongoing Since the start of the ICRIN project in 2009, WHO has developed information materials and\ncarried out trainings and workshops targeting primary health care workers, teachers, and mass-media\nworkers of the most affected regions of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. An ICRIN side\nevent co-sponsored by WHO was featured in conjunction with the international conference held in\nKiev, Ukraine on 20-21 April 2011. Four WHO Collaborating Centres in the Russia Federation and\nUkraine are leading the health research project on Chernobyl-affected populations."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What is WHO's relationship with the IAEA?", "answer": "WHO and the IAEA are both UN entities. WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health\r\nwithin the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters,\r\nshaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy\r\noptions, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends. The IAEA is the UN system agency which works with its Member States and multiple partners\r\nworldwide to promote safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies.\r\nWHO collaborates with the IAEA on a number of areas including the medical use of radiation,\r\nradiation protection and the safety of the public and workers, and radio-nuclear emergency\r\npreparedness and response. Under the auspices of the UN Chernobyl Forum, WHO carried out its own independent health\r\nassessment of the accident. The IAEA assessed the environmental impact and UNDP the socioeconomic impact. A digest document including summaries of the three reports (WHO Health report, IAEA environmental\r\nreport, and UNDP socio-economic impact report) entitled Chernobyl Legacy was then prepared jointly\r\nby three agencies to present a comprehensive picture of the event, and was endorsed by all participants\r\nof the Chernobyl Forum, including eight UN Agencies and the Governments of Belarus, the Russian\r\nFederation, and Ukraine. Mention has often been made of WHO's 1959 agreement with the IAEA. This is a standard agreement\r\nsimilar to agreements it has with other UN agencies as a means of setting out respective areas of work.\r\nThis agreement has never once been used to stop or restrict WHO’s work. The agreement serves the purpose of promoting co-operation and consultation between WHO and\r\nIAEA. It was approved by the highest governing body of each Organization. The agreement between WHO and IAEA does not affect the impartial and independent exercise by\r\nWHO of its statutory responsibilities, nor does it subordinate one Organization to the other. The clause appearing in Article III dealing with the safeguarding of confidential information is a\r\nstandard provision in many agreements of this kind (including WHO agreements with the UN, ILO,\r\nFAO, UNESCO, and UNIDO). On the one hand, it ensures each Organization will continue to meet its obligations to protect certain information it is duty bound to safeguard. In the case of information held\r\nby WHO, such a clause is relevant, for example, for the protection of clinical and other similar data on\r\nindividuals. On the other hand, the provision makes clear that subject to such situations, each\r\nOrganization \"shall keep [the] other fully informed [of] all … work\" of mutual interest. Thus, such\r\nprovisions actually work to improve information flow as they limit the exceptions to the free-flow of\r\ninformation. WHO environmental health experts will continue the scientific collaboration with\r\nradiation and health experts at IAEA. This entails not only nuclear safety issues and assistance in\r\nradiation emergencies, but also the application of clinical techniques connected with such issues. WHO activities on nuclear matters are not in any way hampered by the WHO/IAEA agreement. Both\r\nOrganizations are working tirelessly to assist countries and the global community to deal with this\r\ncomplex emergency."}
{"topic": "/radiation-the-chernobyl-accident", "question": "What have been the wider impacts of the Chernobyl accident?", "answer": "In countries beyond those most directly affected, Chernobyl triggered questions concerning the safety of\ncrops, milk, food, and water; the effects of radiation exposure on different population groups; and the\nkind of preventive measures that were to be put in place. In many countries, the accident prompted\nimportant political discussions regarding the use of nuclear energy and national energy policies. Chernobyl underscored the critical need for international coordination and cooperation related to\nenvironmental hazards. Chernobyl also prompted UN agencies to develop international agreements and\narrangements for nuclear emergencies. In 1986, two international conventions were adopted by the\nIAEA’s General Conference: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the\nConvention on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. WHO, which is\na party to both conventions, set up the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance\nNetwork - WHO REMPAN - in 1987. Today, the network includes more than 40 centres world-wide\nspecialized in radiation emergency medicine, dosimetry, diagnosis and treatment of radiation injuries,\npublic health interventions and long-term follow-up."}

{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "What is OneHealth?", "answer": "The United Nations OneHealth Model is a new software tool designed to strengthen health system analysis, costing and financing\r\nscenarios at the country level. Its primary purpose is to assess public health investment needs in low and middle income countries. For\r\nthe fi rst time, planners have a single framework for planning, costing, impact analysis, budgeting and fi nancing of strategies for all\r\nmajor diseases and health system components."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "How does OneHealth strengthen national health planning?", "answer": "Most existing costing tools take a disease-specific approach. OneHealth is the first tool to present the detailed components of these\r\nexisting tools in a uniform format and link them together. The tool is modular in format and can easily be adapted to different country\r\ncontexts to strengthen the overall capacity of the national health system.\r\nOneHealth enables countries to calculate and plan in the context of national and sub-national health processes. For instance, the UN\r\nSecretary General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health calls for an additional US$ 27 per capita in low-income\r\ncountries to improve maternal and child health. An estimated US$ 40 billion in funding has already been committed over the next\r\nfi ve years. OneHealth helps countries to plan and spend that money for best effect."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "Who uses it?", "answer": "The tool is designed for use by experts involved in national health planning, including government health planners, UN agencies,\r\nnon-governmental organizations, donors, researchers and consultants. It can be used to support the development of a national health\r\nstrategic plan, a medium-term expenditure framework, or a needs assessment for the Millennium Development Goals."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "Why was it developed?", "answer": "OneHealth was developed by a group of UN agencies (UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, World Bank and WHO) in response\r\nto requests from countries to harmonize the content, format and outputs of existing costing tools. The original request for a joint tool\r\nwas made at a 2008 technical consultation in Senegal, and the model builds on the International Health Partnership (IHP+) and Joint\r\nAssessment of National Plans (JANS) framework."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "How has it been developed?", "answer": "Experts in costing from all participating UN agencies have contributed to the technical development of the model. All participating\r\nUN agencies have contributed funds and staff time. The project also received funds from the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis\r\nand Malaria, the Global Health Workforce Alliance and the Health Metrics Network, as well as from bilateral agencies."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "How have countries been involved?", "answer": "A group of health planning experts (known as the Country Reference Group) in low- and middle-income countries ensures that inputs\r\nfrom ministries of health are incorporated into the tool. The group has been attending inter-agency working group meetings, participating\r\nin technical discussions engaging in the tool design and planning for its roll-out."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "When and how will the tool be made available?", "answer": "The tool will be made public in mid-2011, following pilot testing in selected countries. Mechanisms for training, such as web-based\r\ncourses, are currently being explored."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "What does OneHealth cover?", "answer": "The model covers the national health sector, with a focus on public sector health interventions. It also allows for incorporating activities\r\nin the private sector and costing of selected non-health sector activities that may have health impacts."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "What is the basic framework used?", "answer": "The model considers the demands on the health system, whether from a system-wide perspective or a programme-specific perspective.\r\nPlanning for improving service delivery can be done either by programme or by level of delivery (community, health centre, hospital\r\nlevel, etc). The model can be used for both national and sub-national activities. Bottleneck assessment can be used to assess constraints\r\nin the health system and propose solutions."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "How does the integration work between programmes and systems planning?", "answer": "Direct links and checks are built in between different modules. For example, there is a direct link from the Infrastructure module to the\r\nHuman Resources for Health module, communicating the number of health facilities to be built in a year. This enables users to base\r\nhuman resources norms on the forecasted number of facilities per year. Another type of check is the aggregation of programmespecifi c plans, in order to indicate opportunities for integration. For example, the model predicts the share of time that medical staff\r\nwould need to spend attending programme-specifi c training courses on HIV services, maternal health, etc."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "What practical advantages does OneHealth present to users?", "answer": "From the user perspective, moving to OneHealth is relatively simple as the front end of the model closely resembles the formats and\r\nprogrammes already used in tools such as SPECTRUM and LiST. The model has a user friendly interface with formulas explained\r\nin accompanying technical documentation. The intention is to allow fl exibility within a structure and language that corresponds\r\nto the ways in which real world health care system planning is performed. The software is automatically updated on a regular\r\nbasis including recent updates of epidemiology impact models. Ultimately, OneHealth enables users to perform health care system\r\nplanning in a straightforward and transparent manner."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "What are the health systems costs represented?", "answer": "The model takes a comprehensive approach to health systems. It incorporates planning and costing of all the health systems building\r\nblocks: human resources, facilities, equipment and transportation, medicines and supply chains, health management information\r\nsystems, monitoring and evaluation, governance activities such as policy and advocacy, and activities related to financing and\r\nadministration."}
{"topic": "/the-united-nations-onehealth-costing-tool", "question": "Can OneHealth be used for programme-specifi c costing?", "answer": "Yes. The model uses a systemic modular approach. The user can set up and defi ne national disease control programmes to match\r\nthe country context, and then estimate the cost for a specific programme, including an analysis of the broader health system\r\nimplications. The format for programme planning is streamlined so that a consistent approach is used across programmes."}
{"topic": "/question-and-answer-on-reviewing-global-response-to-h1n1-pandemic", "question": "How will the global response to the pandemic H1N1 be reviewed?", "answer": "The assessment of the global response to the pandemic H1N1 will be conducted by the International Health Regulations Review Committee, a committee of experts with a broad mix of scientific expertise and practical experience in public health. The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields. The International Health Regulations (IHR) is an international legal agreement that is binding on 194 States Parties across the globe, including all of the Member States of WHO. The basic purpose of the IHR is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. In January 2010, the WHO Executive Board requested a proposal from the Director-General on how to assess the international response to the pandemic influenza, and then approved her suggestion to convene the IHR Review Committee to review both the pandemic response and the functioning of the IHR. The pandemic H1N1 is the first public health emergency of international concern to occur since the revised IHR came into force. The IHR played a central role in the global response to the pandemic and so review of the IHR and review of the global handling of the pandemic influenza are closely related. The IHR facilitate coordinated international action by requiring countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO so that global reporting of important public health events is timely and open. The IHR were first implemented (i.e., \"entered into force\") worldwide in 2007 and the Health Assembly determined that a first review of its functioning is to take place by the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010. Objectives The review has three key objectives: Assess the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005); Assess the ongoing global response to the pandemic H1N1 (including the role of WHO); and Identify lessons learned important for strengthening preparedness and response for future pandemics and public health emergencies. The committee The IHR Review Committee is made up of approximately 29 members who have been selected from the roster of experts under the IHR structure or other WHO expert committees. The committee members represent a broad mix of expertise, practical experience and backgrounds, and includes experts from developed and developing countries. The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields. They are not WHO staff, nor do they receive funding from WHO for their contributions to the review process. Names of the committee members were made public prior to the first meeting: At the first meeting, Professor Harvey V. Fineberg was elected as chair; Professor Babatunde Osotimehin was elected as vice chair. The IHR Review Committee is considered a WHO expert committee and so its operations and structure follows regulations for WHO expert advisory panels and committees, and provisions of the IHR. Proceedings The committee will determine its methods and schedule of work. The first meeting is scheduled for 12-14 April 2010 at WHO headquarters in Geneva. Observers invited to the first meeting include representatives of all States Parties to the IHR (194 countries), United Nations organizations and relevant intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations in official relations with WHO. The committee will advise the Director-General of its views and findings. Based on the committee's advice, the Director-General will provide an interim report to the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2010, and an expected second, final report to the WHA in May 2011. Participation by countries (IHR States Parties) Countries will have the opportunity to make brief statements to the committee at first meeting, and may also submit comments to the Review Committee on key issues, concerns and lessons learned related to the pandemic response and functioning of the IHR. More about the IHR In the globalized world, diseases can rapidly spread far and wide via international travel and trade. A health crisis in one country can impact livelihoods and economies in many parts of the world. Emerging infections such as an influenza pandemic are an important cause of such events. However, other public health emergencies such as chemical spills, leaks and dumping, or nuclear melt-downs may similarly have global effects. The IHR are not specific for any one disease or group of diseases but generally aim to limit interference with international traffic and trade while ensuring public health through the prevention of disease spread. The IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events, and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security. The IHR also require countries to strengthen their existing capacities for public health surveillance and response. (updated from 1 April 2010 version)"}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "What is the impact of the health worker shortage?", "answer": "The chronic shortage is well recognized as one of the main obstacles to delivery of effective health services to those who need them most. It is one of the most fundamental constraints to achieving international health and development goals such as the\r\n    Millennium Development Goals and universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. For populations, the impact is a lack of access to essential health services: prevention, information, drug distribution, emergencies, clinical care and life-saving interventions such as childhood immunization, safe pregnancy and delivery services for\r\n    mothers and access to treatment for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. For health workers, the effect is an overwhelming workload and stress,, which can lead to a lack of motivation, fatigue, absenteeism, breakdowns, illness, migration or even a career change outside of the health field."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "Which countries are most heavily affected?", "answer": "All countries are affected, one way or another -- the health worker crisis is an issue for everyone. Sub-Saharan Africa faces the greatest challenge and proportionately, is the most heavily affected region of the world. One million health workers are needed to bridge the gap in this region. While it has 25 % of the global burden of disease, it has only 3 % of the world's health workers. There are a cluster of countries in Southern Africa that are undergoing a deep crisis: few health workers, high HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB burden, poorly performing health systems, and the highest rate of migration anywhere in the world, particularly in that region's English-speaking countries. Due to its considerable share of the world's population, Asia also needs millions of additional health workers to bridge its health workforce gap. The needs are greatest in South Asia, especially in rural areas. In the European or North American media, the 'shortage' of health workers is also often discussed in relation to OECD countries. As populations (and the health workers themselves) are ageing in these countries, health care demand is constantly increasing. Table: \"Inequities in the distribution of health workers worldwide\" (WHO 2006)"}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "What do we mean by availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ) of the health workforce?", "answer": "The current discourse on HRH is evolving from an exclusive focus on availability of health workers – i.e. numbers – towards according equal importance to accessibility, acceptability, quality and performance. Availability – the sufficient supply and appropriate stock of health workers, with the competencies and skill‐mix to match the health needs of the population; Accessibility – the equitable distribution of these health workers taking into account the demographic composition, rural‐urban mix and under‐served areas or populations; Acceptability – health workforce characteristics and ability (e.g. sex, language, culture, age, etc.)to treat all patients with dignity, create trust and promote demand for services; Quality – health workforce competencies, skills, knowledge and behaviour, as assessed according to professional norms and as perceived by users. Without sufficient availability – accessibility to health workers cannot be guaranteed; if they are available and accessible, without acceptability, the health services might not be used, when the quality of the health workforce is inadequate, improvements\r\n    in health outcomes will not be satisfactory."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "What are the latest statistics on health workforce availability? Why does the latest HRH report (A Universal Truth – No health without a Workforce, 2013) use a different threshold (33.45/10’000) from the WHO 2006 report(22.8/10’000)?", "answer": "The 22.8/10,000 population threshold was identified in 2006 to partly illustrate the global shortage of health workers in relation to the objective of delivering essential health services of relevance to the MDGs – primarily MDG 4 and 5. The HRH\r\n    ‘crisis’ category refers to two dimensions: density of skilled health professionals less than 22.8/10,000 population and deliveries by skilled birth attendants less than 80%; so low HRH density and low service coverage together. Using\r\n    this threshold the WHR 2006 identified a shortage of 4.3 million health workers. Almost a decade later, the threshold of 34.5 skilled health professionals (midwives, nurses and physicians) per 10,000 population has emerged in the discourse on universal health coverage, based on the density of health professionals of a country (Thailand)\r\n    which has attained very high coverage of a broader range of health services. This threshold comes from analysis conducted by the International Labour Organization in support of its regulation on Social Protection, the World Social Security Statistics\r\n    2010/2011. There are currently 100 countries with a density of skilled health professionals below this threshold, translating in a total shortage of about 7.2 million skilled health professionals. Based on projections of a simple model entirely driven by population growth, this gap would increase to 12.9 million by 2035. It is important to note that none of these thresholds are meant to be planning targets, but rather are used to illustrate the variance in HRH availability, and the magnitude of challenges that lie ahead, calling for transformative approaches to planning,\r\n    education and management of the health workforce. Thresholds identified to allow comparisons and promote dialogue at global level however have limitations in terms of their use to national policy makers. What is needed is a move towards context-specific identification of needs and opportunities, so that\r\n    countries can rather set their own benchmarks, assess progress, and revise them over time as required and as they broaden the scope of health services they intend to provide to the population."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "Why is migration a problem for global health?", "answer": "When a country has a fragile health system, the loss of its workforce has the potential to bring the whole system to collapse, with significant consequences in terms of lives lost. From a financial perspective, when significant numbers of doctors and\r\n    nurses leave, the countries that financed their education lose a return on their investment and become unwilling donors to the wealthy countries to which their health personnel have migrated. Developing countries lose some of their most valuable health workers to richer countries. For example, 75 percent of doctors trained in Mozambique now work abroad. The majority work in Portugal (1,218) and the rest work in South Africa (61), US (20) and\r\n    UK (16).* * Human Resources for Health: New data on African Health professionals abroad. Michael A. Clemens & Gunilla Pettersson"}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "Can / should health worker migration be stopped?", "answer": "The issue is not about 'stopping' migration; rather it is about management and regulation. Freedom of movement is a fundamental right according to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and migration is a staple of human history. Globalization\r\n    has accelerated this trend significantly. But the grave effects of health workforce migration on developing countries call for a responsible, regulated management of migration, with a critical aim that all countries move towards self-sufficiency. Some countries specifically train health workers for 'export'. Bilateral agreements between 'importing' and 'exporting' countries need to be encouraged to protect the rights of the health worker and offer some guarantee of employment level in the 'importing'\r\n    country. The Alliance and several of its partners, in particular WHO, is also working on a Global Code of Practice on ethical international recruitment of health workers. This instrument will be designed to ensure that all best practices are followed and protect\r\n    the rights of workers while providing a framework for bilateral cooperation."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "How long might the health workforce crisis last?", "answer": "Health systems are not easily or rapidly strengthened or reformed. Scaling up 'production' (educating and training more health workers) is the initial stage but this can take time: a nursing qualification usually takes three years of training, and a physician\r\n    at least five. Innovative methods (distance learning, 'task shifting' or community health worker programmes) can shorten this delay effect, but there is no \"quick fix\" to this problem: community health workers, nurses and physicians need each other\r\n    to work effectively as teams. More schools and teachers are also needed to really 'scale up', although technical advances (distance learning, IT) and increased twinning between schools can and should be used to enable this surge of students. Significant financial support and technical\r\n    cooperation are also necessary for improving a decaying infrastructure, as well as institutional development for improving the quality of education. The next step is employment, which brings challenges of its own: many countries affected by the health worker shortage already have scores of unemployed health workers: public spending on health may be capped (due to macroeconomic constraints), and private\r\n    enterprise may not be an option for individual health workers. Many countries thus lack the capacity to employ the workforce they have trained. If nothing is done, the crisis will worsen. If action is taken – as recommended by WHO, The Alliance and many field experts – with strong country ownership and leadership, stakeholder consultation, national and international funding, the crisis\r\n    could be at least partially solved by 2015, thereby enabling the fulfilment of the health-related Millennium Development Goals."}
{"topic": "/q-a-on-the-health-workforce-crisis", "question": "What is the Global Health Workforce Alliance (The Alliance)?", "answer": "The Alliance is a global partnership, formed in 2006 as a joint platform for action on the health workforce crisis. Its members include governments, UN agencies, professional associations, NGOs, foundations, research and training institutions and the\r\n    private sector. When the scale and complexity of the health workforce issue became apparent, so did the need for a global focal point which could assemble all these actors' interest around a common goal: to ensure that all people have access to a\r\n    skilled, motivated and supported health worker. As a partnership, The Alliance' purpose is to highlight the crisis and keep it on the global agenda, convene members, partners and countries to work together to find solutions, advocate for their effective implementation and facilitate the sharing of\r\n    knowledge and best practices on health workforce issues. For administrative and legal purposes, The Alliance Secretariat is housed within the headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. WHO does not fund nor control The Alliance' operations, but is a founding member and partner\r\n    of The Alliance with a permanent seat on the Board of The Alliance, as are professional associations, NGOs and other constituencies including donor governments."}
